       " 'News': [\"\\nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has removed Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from lawmaker and party member after the audio recording of a phone conversation alleged to be between him and businessman Durga Prasai.\\nThe party’s central committee meeting held on Wednesday has decided to punish Shrestha after audio recording of him purportedly demanding Rs 20 million from promoter of B&C Medical College Durga Prasai was made public.\\nTalking to reporters after the meeting RSP President Lamichhane said that Shrestha was removed after finding enough grounds to punish him despite him denying that the voice on the audio was not his.\\nKapurbot Media on Sunday had published audio recording of what it claims is the deal between Shrestha and Prasai.\\nShrestha, who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system, can be heard telling Prasai that the amount was needed to give to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.\\nThe conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.\\nLamichhane also revealed that Shrestha threatened the party’s discipline committee to finish RSP if he were punished. “He has been repeatedly changing his version. His guilt was proven also because the audio was recorded in January. He was allowed to present his version (in the party) repeatedly,” Lamichhane stated. “He also wished that he were not removed but also warned that he would show the party if he were punished.”\\nHe claimed that he did not know who Shrestha was referring to as his men in the ‘core team’ in the audio recording. “Why not punish if facts are uncovered about the core team? He has now come to one level of bargaining.

CEO Joshi said preparations will be stopped due to that instruction and in respect of public sentiments. \"We had taken the event as an opportunity for tourism promotion and branding. But we have decided to stop it feeling it is not the appropriate time to host the event due to the instruction of parliamentary committee and other political and social reasons,\" he added.\\r\\nMinister for Communication and Information Technology Gokul Baskota during the weekly press conference on Thursday had said the event will be hosted in a way that the NTB and the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) are joint co-organizers. The event was scheduled for the last week of August.\\r\\nThe government had formed a high level committee under Minister of State for Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation Dhan Bahadur Buda.\\r\\nThe event would have cost the government almost Rs 1 billion.

Another Rs 200 million will have to be spent in that,\" the member told Setopati.\\r\\nMillions will also have to be spent on security for the guests and awards taking the expenditure to almost Rs 1 billion.\\r\\nNTB CEO Joshi, however, claimed that the money will be well-spent providing unprecedented promotion for Nepal. \"This is an event with a viewership greater than that of Oscars. This will create a brand for the city. We can also send a message that we are capable and safe to organize such huge events,\" he reasoned. \"They will name the event Nepal IIFA and many television channels will promote the event as Nepal IIFA.\"\\r\\nHe said the event will also provide an opportunity to bring multiple stars. \"We have to spend around Rs 50 million to bring one star now.

He won 12 awards Wednesday in Las Vegas, making his career total 27 (Swift has 23 wins).\\r\\n\\r\\nHe looked up to the ceiling as he held the trophy, then said: “I just want to thank my mom for her relentless effort in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to thank my mom for all the times you drove me to piano. All the times you drove me to basketball and hockey — that clearly didn’t work out. All the times you drove me to ‘Degrassi.’ No matter how long it took me to figure out what I wanted to do, you were always there to give me a ride, and now we’re on one hell of ride,” Drake said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFamily bonding was a theme at the three-hour show, which aired live on NBC and was hosted by Kelly Clarkson\\r\\n\\r\\nCiara’s young son and husband, NFL player Russell Wilson, danced along while she worked the stage, and Nick and Joe Jonas gave kisses to Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner of “Game of Thrones” fame when they sang in the audience before hitting the stage.

She was in diva form before taking the award from Jennifer Hudson, throwing her napkin on the floor after dabbing her face with it.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Without getting into all the drama, all the ups and downs of my career ... I guess I always felt like an outsider, someone who doesn’t quite belong anywhere, and I still feel like that lost interracial child who had a lot of nerve to believe I could succeed at anything at all in this world. But, and this is the truth, I did believe because I had to,” she said. “The truth is I dedicated my life to my music — my saving grace — and to my fans.”\\r\\n\\r\\nCardi B, the night’s top nominee with 21, locked lips with husband Offset on the red carpet and the couple sat closely inside the venue. She won six awards, including top Hot 100 song for “Girls Like You” with Maroon 5.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember when Maroon 5 hit me up to do this song. I was like, ‘Bro I’m five months pregnant. I can’t even breathe.’ But this record to me was so amazing. I was like, ‘Oh this is going to be a hit.’ And now I sing this song to my daughter because she’s the girl that I need,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nDrake and Cardi B — who both won multiple awards during the live telecast — used their speeches to promote love and appreciation for their peers in the music industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers, too, brought on the positive energy when onstage. Imagine Dragons’ band leader Dan Reynolds used his speech to highlight the dangers of conversion therapy on LGBTQ youth. He earned rousing applause. Florida Georgia Line’s Tyler Hubbard followed suit, telling the audience after winning top country song: “In the spirit of so much truth being spoken tonight by so many talented artists, I think we should speak some truth.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“As artists we all get to experience so many unbelievable things, but in our opinion, at the end of the day, it’s all for nothing if you’re not using your platform for better ... to spread love, to help those in needs, to be a light to your community,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSwift kicked off the show when she brought her new music video to life with a colorful, eye-popping performance of her song “ME!” Dancers wearing bright, pastel colors spun in the air holding umbrellas and a marching band kicked off Swift’s performance — like most of the world, maybe she was inspired by Beyonce’s new Coachella film?\\r\\n\\r\\nMadonna, wearing an eye-patch, teamed up with Colombian singer Maluma for a performance, but it was Grammy-winning Christian artist Lauren Daigle who had the night’s best performance. She sang “You Say,” giving the audience a calm, yet strong and powerful performance. She was backed by three awesome background singers and a pianist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTS, who performed alongside Halsey, also had a major night.

Jack Sparrow in the “Pirates of the Caribbean” films.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeard’s lawyers also argued that the lawsuit should be moved to Los Angeles because that’s where the relevant events took place and the court would be in a position to subpoena witnesses and find facts.\\r\\n\\r\\nHeard first accused Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married.

       "  '\\n                            Billy Porter, speaking to Vogue before he walked the Oscars red carpet, knew what he was in for among some social media users:\\r\\n\\r\\n“People are going to be really uncomfortable with my black ass in a ball gown, but it’s not anybody’s business but mine.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe remark from the Tony-winning stage performer, actor and singer was both prescient and disproven. There was mega-praise for his velvet custom tuxedo look by Christian Siriano and outrage over the notion that an African American man in a dress was a threat to black masculinity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was just the conversation Porter had hoped to provoke, not to collect virulent hate but to help move along the idea that we all deserve respect, across racial lines and the gender divide.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was ready to create the conversation,” Porter told The Associated Press in a phone interview Monday the day after the Oscars. “We have to teach people how to treat us, we have to teach people how to love us, we have to teach people how to respect us, and the only way we do that is to respect ourselves.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter, the black and gay breakout star of the boundary-expanding FX series “Pose,” spent awards season using fashion as political art, as he describes it. There were previous dresses, and there was help from powerhouses Tom Ford and Michael Kors in the later weeks, along with smaller designers who embrace a greater gender fluidity in their collections and were thrilled early on to dress him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a nominee at the Golden Globes, Porter’s custom trouser look by Randi Rahm, including a huge, hot pink-lined cape and floral embellishments, grabbed attention, but social media support and disdain after the 49-year-old took to the Oscars carpet took the debate into the stratosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter understands where established notions of black masculinity originated, and he understands how toxic they can be. He and his stylist, Sam Ratelle, also realize how rigid gender-driven taboos can be and want to help the walls come down.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It goes all the way back to the earliest of emasculations, which is slavery, so the only way to sort of overcome that is to be the strongest and the most masculine and the most powerful and now, what has become toxic,” Porter said. “And I don’t think it’s just black people. I think it’s men in general. Every ethnicity has their version of it.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter couldn’t care less about negative comments.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The comments are not my business. What people think about what I’m doing is not my business. I lived that already,” he said. “I’m inside of my authenticity and the whole point is that you have to respect me as much as I respect you. If you don’t like it, go somewhere else. You don’t have to look. It’s not about you. I don’t understand why my putting on a dress causes this much strife in your life.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRatelle said he began working with Porter about a year ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n“He said, ‘I want to be a piece of walking art,’ and we just went from there,” Ratelle said. “It’s been really awesome to work with a bunch of great designers. Randi Rahm was certainly completely open. Issey Miyake was fantastic for the Radio City show (Porter was a study in white). Christian Siriano, the fact that he did this custom gown in one week, was incredible after saying, ‘Absolutely. There’s no question we’ll do this.’ Michael Kors has been the most gracious human. So has Tom Ford.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter said he’s just getting started in terms of pushing along the conversation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“People are actually listening,” he said. “I hope it opens up a dialogue of healing. I will always continue to do me. If there’s anything I’ve learned in the 49 years that I’ve lived on this planet, is that being authentic is the only version of the story that anybody should be.”\\r\\n\\r\\nPorter has always been a fashion lover. This year, he was an ambassador for the Council of Fashion Designers of America for men’s fashion week in New York and attended a variety of shows featuring a variety of looks, from traditional to gender fluid.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that awards season is over, and the fashion week cycle is finishing up in Paris, Porter said he’ll continue to wear whatever he likes, with a great number of designers on board to help with pulls from their lines and custom outfits.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Pre-Golden Globes it was difficult,” he said of options available to him, considering that he’s not sample size. “After the Golden Globes it has not been difficult. You work with the people who work with you. You walk through the doors that are open. I’m never a beggar.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn real life, or at least on live TV during the Oscars, Helen Mirren appeared ready for change, noting that both she and her co-presenter, Jason Momoa, were dressed in pink.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It just goes to show, doesn’t it, that these days a Hawaiian god and a very mature Englishwoman can actually wear the same color. We can both wear pink,” she said to claps.\\r\\n\\r\\nMomoa agreed: “Finally. The times are changin’.”\\n',\n",

His majestic and galvanizing presence set him among the most recognizable figures in the world.\\nPelé died Thursday at 82. He had undergone treatment for colon cancer since 2021.\\nPelé was among the game’s most prolific scorers and spent nearly two decades enchanting fans and dazzling opponents. His grace, athleticism and moves on soccer’s highest stage transfixed all. He orchestrated a fast, fluid style of play that revolutionized the sport — a flair that personified Brazilian elegance on the field.\\nHe carried his country to soccer’s heights and became a global ambassador for his sport in a journey that began on the streets of Sao Paulo state, where he would kick a sock stuffed with newspapers or rags.\\n“Pelé changed everything. He transformed football into art, entertainment,” Neymar, a fellow Brazilian soccer player, said on Instagram. “Football and Brazil elevated their standing thanks to the King! He is gone, but his magic will endure. Pelé is eternal!”\\nIn the conversation about soccer’s greatest player, only the late Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are mentioned alongside him.\\nDifferent sources, counting different sets of games, list Pelé’s goal totals anywhere between 650 (league matches) to 1,281 (all senior matches, some against low-level competition). When Maradona once interviewed Pelé, he playfully asked the Brazilian how he accumulated so many goals.\\nThe player who would be dubbed “The King” was introduced to the world at 17 at the 1958 World Cup in Sweden, the youngest player ever at the tournament.\\nPelé was the emblem of his country’s World Cup triumph of 1970 in Mexico. He scored in the final and set up Carlos Alberto with a nonchalant pass for the last goal in a 4-1 victory over Italy.\\nThe image of Pelé in a bright-yellow Brazil jersey, with the No. 10 stamped on the back, remains alive with soccer fans everywhere. As does his trademark goal celebration — a leap with a right fist thrust high above his head.\\nPelé’s fame was such that in 1967 factions of a civil war in Nigeria agreed to a brief cease-fire so he could play an exhibition match in the country. He was knighted by Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II in 1997. When Pelé visited Washington to help popularize the game in North America, it was the U.S. president who stuck out his hand first.\\n“You don’t need to introduce yourself because everyone knows who Pelé is,” Ronald Reagan said.\\nPelé was Brazil’s first modern Black national hero but rarely spoke about racism in a country where the rich and powerful tend to hail from the white minority.\\nOpposing fans taunted Pelé with monkey chants at home and all over the world.\\n“He said that he would never play if he had to stop every time he heard those chants,” said Angelica Basthi, one of Pelé’s biographers. “He is key for Black people’s pride in Brazil, but never wanted to be a flagbearer.”\\nPelé’s life after soccer took many forms. He was a politician — Brazil’s Extraordinary Minister for Sport — a wealthy businessman, and an ambassador for UNESCO and the United Nations.\\nHe had roles in movies, soap operas and even composed songs and recorded CDs of popular Brazilian music.\\nPelé was an ambassador for his sport until his final years but as his health deteriorated his travels and appearances became less frequent.

Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.\\nBorn Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.\\nPelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.\\nThe name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.\\nPelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.\\n“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”\\nThe 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.\\nHe changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.\\nIn all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.\\nHis run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.\\nOn the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.\\nThe fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.\\nPelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos.

Surprisingly Babar used his premium left-arm spinner Mohammad Nawaz for only one over which went for three runs as both Sri Lanka batters cut loose against the pace of Shah and Mohammad Hasnain (0-41).\\nPakistan was scrappy in the field as Rajapaksa was dropped either side of his half century by Shadab in the deep. Rauf had Hasaranga caught behind in the 15th over, but Rajapaksa added a further 54 runs in the last five overs with Chamika Karunaratne, who made 14 not out.\\nRajapaksa provided Sri Lanka with a late flourish when he smashed Shah for a boundary off the penultimate ball and then smashed a six over extra cover to give Sri Lanka a strong total to defend.\\nSri Lanka made a stunning comeback with five successive wins in the tournament after getting beaten by Afghanistan in its opening game.

Then, in a frantic finish, Reece James smashed a shot against the post before Livaković made a stunning double stop to deny Mason Mount then Hakim Ziyech.\\nUltimately, the smash-and-grab win was earned thanks to the early goal by Oršić, who met a headed flick-on by Bruno Petković in midfield by chesting the ball forward inside his own half past Chelsea defender Wesley Fofana and racing clear of the newly signed French defender toward goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga.\\nAs he approached Kepa, Oršić lifted the ball over the keeper and it bobbled into the net.\\nDinamo looked dangerous in the rare attacks it had in a performance underpinned by defensive discipline and, from one counterattack, Stefan Ristovski powered in a rising shot that was tipped onto the crossbar by Kepa, who was selected ahead of Edouard Mendy.\\n“It’s an underperformance from us,” Tuchel said. “We have the same story as always — we have an OK start, we don’t finish our half-chances, we don’t feel it when the game is already there to put to bed in the first 15-20 minutes, then we concede one counter-attack which is far too easy.\\n“And from there, we struggled.”\\n',\n",

He came off in the 58th to a standing ovation to be replaced by Cristiano Ronaldo, who again had to settle for a starting spot on the bench.\\nSince that humiliating 4-0 loss at Brentford that sparked a crisis and some doubts around the wisdom of hiring Erik ten Hag as manager, United has beaten Liverpool, Southampton, Leicester and now Arsenal, the league leader.\\nAfter six games, United is only three points behind Arsenal and two behind Manchester City, the title favorite.\\nHow quickly things have turned around.\\n',\n",

Bruno Fernandes found Marcus Rashford in a central position and he slipped in Sancho, who rounded goalkeeper Danny Ward and slotted the ball into an empty net.\\nLeicester is now the Premier League’s crisis club, with just one point from its first five games and two points adrift in last place. The pressure is rising on its manager, Brendan Rodgers, who grumbled after the match about the club’s failure to strengthen the squad in the summer transfer.\\nLeicester only signed one outfield player, unheralded defender Wout Faes from French club Reims, and he only arrived on deadline day to fill the gap left by the departure of Wesley Fofana to Chelsea.\\n“With the greatest respect,” Rodgers said, “we have not had the help in the market this team needed.”\\nThe hosts only seriously threatened United goalkeeper David De Gea once and that was from a free kick, which James Maddison whipped over the defensive wall and brought out a fine one-handed save.

Ederson had to save at full stretch to keep out Saint-Maximin before substitute Ruben Dias — on for the injured Nathan Ake — deflected Wilson’s attempt wide.\\nThe respite proved temporary. Saint-Maximin tricked his way past Kyle Walker and Rodri down the left to cross to the far post where Almiron slid in to turn the ball home.

Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp blanked Núñez as the Uruguay striker headed down the tunnel.\\n“It’s a red card,” Klopp said. “He was provoked all the time but that is not how to behave.”\\nNúñez, an offseason signing from Benfica, earned his first start after a couple of impressive, goalscoring displays off the bench in the Community Shield against Manchester City and then against Fulham, and also because Roberto Firmino was missing through injury.\\nHe missed a very presentable early chance against Palace by miscuing a close-range volley at the back post, and then hit the post from a similar range in the final minute of the first half.\\nMaybe some frustration had set by the time he was red-carded. As they jostled at the edge of Palace’s penalty area, Núñez threw his head back at Andersen and missed. Then, when confronted moments later by the aggrieved defender, Núñez turned into Andersen and butted him square in the face.\\nAlready trailing because of Wilfried Zaha’s 32nd-minute goal, Liverpool was really up against it. But even down to 10 men, Klopp’s team still dominated possession and Díaz earned his team a point by cutting in from the left, slipping between two defenders, and curling a shot into the far corner in front of the Kop.

It was an incredible goal.”\\nPalace relied almost exclusively on the counterattack throughout the match and it was from that means that Zaha opened the scoring, breaking the offside trap to latch onto Eberechi Eze’s through-ball and curl a finish into the far corner.\\nZaha missed a great chance to snatch a win when he stretched to meet a cross late in the game and hit the post.\\nLiverpool has now drawn its first two games — Klopp’s team was held 2-2 by Fulham in the opening weekend — and is already four points behind Manchester City and Arsenal, the early pacesetters.\\nIts third match will be at Old Trafford next Monday against a beleaguered Manchester United team that has lost both of its games.\\nNúñez will be suspended for that, while Klopp is set to be without a slew of key players, with the likes of Thiago Alcantara, Diogo Jota, Ibrahima Konaté and Joel Matip currently out injured. Firmino missed the game as a precaution, according to Liverpool, so could be fit in a week’s time.\\n“Everything went against us during the week,” Klopp said. “It was crazy — it was like a witch was in the building. Every time somebody else had problems and then putting in such a performance, especially in the circumstances, I’m really proud.”\\n',\n",

Pushing and shoving ensued, just as there had been between the two managers in the technical area during the match at Stamford Bridge. They were then shown red cards.\\nConte celebrated Tottenham’s first equalizer, by Pierre-Emile Højbjerg in the 68th minute, by barging into the chest of Tuchel, sparking a melee among the two sets of coaching staff.\\nThen, after Reece James put Chelsea back in front in the 77th, Tuchel set off on a sprint past Conte and down the touchline, clenching his fist in pure delight.\\nKane’s goal came in the sixth of seven added-on minutes, the striker glancing in a header that took a touch off the thigh of James before going into the net.\\nKalidou Koulibaly had put Chelsea ahead in the 19th minute by meeting a deep corner from Marc Cucurella with a stunning volley that flew high into the net for his first goal since joining in the offseason from Napoli.\\nTottenham, which only came to life after the introduction of Richarlison, ended a run of five straight losses to Chelsea in all competitions but remained stuck on just one victory at Stamford Bridge since the Premier League started in 1992.\\nBoth teams have four points from two games.\\n',\n",

He got his second in the 35th from a header and had several chances to finish the game at Emirates Stadium with a hat trick.\\nThe two times Leicester found itself back in the match, Arsenal responded right away.\\nThe visitors made it 2-1 from an own goal by William Saliba in the 53rd, but Arsenal midfielder Granit Xhaka restored the home side’s two-goal cushion two minutes later. Xhaka scored after Jesus poked a loose ball into his path after Leicester goalkeeper Danny Ward failed to hold on to a routine cross into the box and collided with defender Wesley Fofana.\\nLeicester attacking midfielder James Maddison made it 3-2 in the 74th when he sent a low shot through the legs of Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale.\\nA nervous murmur went through the crowd, but the Arsenal team didn’t panic as it did in similar situations in recent seasons. Jesus drove forward just a minute later and squared the ball to forward Gabriel Martinelli, who fired a left-footed shot from just outside the area to beat Ward at the back post to make it 4-2.\\nLeicester also had a penalty decision overturned just before halftime after the referee first pointed to the spot and then was asked to review a coming together of Ramsdale and Leicester forward Jamie Vardy in the box.\\nOn a hot day when the mercury hit around 33 C (91 F), six goals and the pace of the game took a lot out of the players and water breaks were needed in each half. The result means that Arsenal has won both of its opening league games, with Leicester drawing its first match.\\nJesus was the focus of Arsenal’s attack throughout the match, with teammates trying to get him the ball at every opportunity. For his first goal, he took one touch after receiving a pass from Xhaka, set himself and then bent a shot that took a slight deflection to sail in past Ward.\\nJesus got a bit of help for his second from Vardy. The Leicester forward flicked the ball backward across the face of goal from a corner, and Jesus headed into an empty net at the back post.\\nThe striker nearly scored a hat trick before halftime when he dominated Leicester defender Jonny Evans with his back to goal, spun around him into the box and fired a low shot saved by Ward. He had multiple chances in the second half as well.\\nUnlike Arsenal, Leicester has been very quiet in the transfer market. The team only announced its first signing of the transfer window on the eve of Saturday’s match. Alex Smithies, a 32-year-old backup goalkeeper who most recently played for Cardiff, signed with the Foxes on a two-year deal.\\n',\n",

Gundogan’s left-footed finish found the bottom corner in the 19th for his 50th goal for City.\\nDe Bruyne scored the pick of the goals, the playmaker cutting inside on a counterattack led by Foden in the 31st, beating a defender and bending his shot with the outside of his right foot into the far corner.\\nDe Bruyne returned the favor for Foden six minutes later, slipping a brilliant pass through the legs of a defender and into the path of his teammate, who took a touch and fired in a deflected shot that beat goalkeeper Mark Travers.\\nHaaland’s best chance fell in the 73rd when he mishit a first-time shot wide from Jack Grealish’s cut-back. The striker was substituted moments later.\\nThe scoring was completed by Jefferson Lerma, who unwittingly turned a cross from Joao Cancelo into his own net from inside Bournemouth’s six-yard box.\\nIt was a wake-up call for Bournemouth after the promoted team started the season with a surprisingly comfortable 2-0 win over Aston Villa last weekend.\\nCity manager Pep Guardiola again chose to start with Bernardo Silva on the bench. The Portugal midfielder has been linked with a move to Barcelona and didn’t start against West Ham, either.\\n',\n",

It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions.

The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken.

Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair.

       "  '\\nKathmandu Mayor Balen Shah has issued instruction to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas from Saturday. Waste materials are starting to pile up at the country’s administrative center and other sensitive areas of the state after his instruction to Paribartan Nepal, a private company that has been collecting garbage. \\xa0\\n“Garbage of Singha Durbar will not be picked from today. Leaders there will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned,” Shah had posted on Facebook Saturday to inform about stopping garbage collection.\\nBoth the expression and the deed of Shah are irresponsible and anarchic.\\nThose in public position should not just fulfill their responsibilities but also maintain decorum of their post. They should also think about dignity of others. What does he actually mean by ‘leaders from Singha Durbar will have to be dumped at Sisdole if the country really has to be cleaned’? This is absolutely anarchic and apolitical expression in itself. This says more about Shah himself than other leaders.\\nLeaders, whether seated at the Singha Durbar or the Bag Durbar, have both strengths and weaknesses. People have elected them to their respective posts expecting them to resolve the country’s problems remaining within their limits and maintaining dignity.\\nShah seems to suffer from this mental illness that only he is right and all the others deserve to be dumped at Sisdole. He can criticize the works of others and also recommend to work in a certain manner. He can offer support but cannot run away from his responsibilities by abusing and blaming others.\\nHe posted a defense of his decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar on Monday listing the works in which 14 ministries of the federal government did not cooperate with him. The majority\\xa0of the issues he has raised are beyond his jurisdiction. He has stake in them in capacity of a citizen and a mayor, and can also speak about them or provide suggestion. But he cannot stop picking of garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office citing lack of cooperation by others in issues not in his jurisdiction. \\xa0\\nKathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) not picking garbage from the Prime Minister’s Office and the President’s Office is as unimaginable and irresponsible as the federal government stopping budget allocated for the KMC or not sending staffers citing lack of support\\xa0from mayor.\\nLet us look at some of the issues he says that the federal government has not cooperated on. He has said that he met different ministers once or twice and talked about issues ranging from the program of bringing Melamchi water round the year to Kathmandu by connecting Yangri and Larke rivers to Melamchi to management of Melamchi water and pipeline, appropriate management of the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL), procurement of fertilizers for the farmers, cooperative regulations and laws, expansion of the Ring Road, sanitation of public hospitals, insurance, implementation of the Supreme Court (SC) order to demolish the top story of the Health Ministry, and even passing the map of airport.\\nHe has stated that he reached the conclusion to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar as the problems have not been resolved and there was no appropriate coordination despite his efforts for nine months.\\nSome of the issues and works he has raised may be of concern for him but definitely not in his jurisdiction. Those problems will not be resolved merely after him meeting the ministers and talking with them. The line ministries and government bodies work in their own manner and there may be dalliance and lack of appropriate coordination in some of those works. There may even be corruption in some of those works. But that all comes down\\xa0to the capacity of our overall state system. That is precisely why we are in the current state.\\nIf a mere meeting of the mayor with the ministers were to resolve those problems, they would not have remained unresolved until now in the first place. There is an error in the thinking that problems remain only because nobody wants them resolved. To think all seated at the Singha Durbar are crooks and say that they deserve to be dumped at Sisdole is his hubris and madness.\\xa0\\nWhy many problems that the KMC can resolve on its own remain as they were if the problems facing the country could be resolved magically as he seems to think or if mere good intentions were to suffice? Has the KMC completed all the works that it can do on its own?\\nThe KMC has not been able to resolve many problems that many other metropolitan cities have resolved.\\nLet us look at a small example. There is problem of squatters in almost all the metropolitan cities of the country. There are genuine and fake squatters in all metropolitan cities. It is necessary to first ascertain who out of them are genuine squatters and who are not to resolve the problem. Record must be collected by going to the squatter settlements for that. It is the responsibility of the metropolitan cities to do that. The state has formulated a policy to address those identified as genuine squatters in that manner. The state accepts that it has responsibility toward them. It is basic responsibility of the state even from the perspective of social justice. Many metropolitan cities have moved forward toward resolving the problem after collecting record of squatters but the KMC is not ready to collect record of squatters. It contends that all of them are encroachers and their record, therefore, should not be collected. Shah stresses on removing them even at the cost of a bloody clash deploying excavators and the police. He has made many attempts to that regard. The KMC has been forced to take a step back after clash with the squatters on each\\xa0occasion.\\nHis main gripe with the Singha Durbar is lack of mobilization of police to exercise force on the squatters. A civilized state that believes in social justice never can, and should, support him in this wrong objective. \\xa0\\nMayor Balen Shah suffers from this attitude that all he thinks and believes in is right, and all others think and believe in is\\xa0wrong, and only he is right and all others are wrong. His prescription of dumping all others at Sisdole to develop the country is manifestation of that attitude.\\nKMC is not just Balen Shah. It also has other elected representatives. He seems to have unilaterally taken the decision to not pick garbage from the Singha Durbar and the Shital Niwas without consulting anyone. \\xa0Deputy mayor and the ward chair concerned have confirmed that the mayor’s decision was made without informing them. The other elected people’s representatives of KMC also cannot evade this issue now. They must speak clearly whether what he has done is right or wrong. They must form a position as to whether to do so in the pretext of cooperation from the federal government is right or not.\\nLet us assume that the Prime Minister’s Office and the ministries actually did not cooperate. Why drag the office of the constitutional president in this? How is the office of the head of state connected to this? Why was the prestige of that office not considered even a bit?\\n\\xa0Let the other elected representatives of KMC and the federal government speak clearly to Mayor Shah. Let the federal government immediately provide support and coordination it can in the works of KMC. Not just the KMC but even other local bodies and provincial government have been facing obstruction in their works in lack of necessary laws and downward delegation of the rights.\\xa0Let the federal government work for resolving that as soon as possible.\\nLet everyone remind Mayor Balen Shah of his limits, the dignity and responsibilities of mayoralty; tell him that federal, provincial and local governments must move forward with mutual support, coordination and cooperation; and remind him that problems cannot be resolved by blaming and abusing one another.\\n',\n",

They were due financial package as per the spirit of the peace agreement. But they were not provided the package by labeling them disqualified on different pretexts and they suffered injustice. They could neither be integrated in the Nepal Army (NA) nor were paid by the state. It is, therefore, necessary to pay them even 15 years after the peace agreement as per the spirit of the peace process.\\nThe Cabinet meeting on March 20 decided to provide Rs 200,000 each to them and has sent the decision to the Home Ministry. Home Secretary Binod Prakash Singh has told the Rastriya Samachar Samiti that the ministry is preparing a working procedure for distributing the money.\\nSome of the Nepali Congress (NC) leaders say that they have been told by Prime Minister (PM) Pushpa Kamal Dahal that such a decision has not been taken. PM Dahal himself, however, has not spoken publicly about the issue. It can, therefore, be understood that the process of distributing relief has moved forward.\\nAre the 4,000 persons that the Maoists want to pay with the taxpayers’ money really combatants? We have to look at the background of the peace process to understand that.\\nThe seven political parties and the Maoists on November 8, 2006 had agreed to keep Maoist combatants in the main cantonments at Kailali, Surkhet, Rolpa, Palpa, Kavre, Sindhuli and Ilam districts, and that the combatants would be verified and monitored by the UN to hold peaceful and fair Constituent Assembly Election without any fear, and democratization and restructuring of the Nepal Army as per the spirit of the 12-point agreement, 8-point agreement, 25-point code of conduct, and the five-point letter sent to the UN on August 9, 2006.\\nThe peace agreement signed on November 21, 2006 after that had agreed to keep the Maoist combatants and their weapons in the cantonments.\\nThe agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006 then set standards for Maoist combatants. A person must have joined the Maoists before May 25, 2006, and be born before May 25, 1988 to qualify as a combatant during the verification process.\\nThe cut-off date of birth was kept to be prior to May 25, 1988 to ensure that they would have completed at least 18 years on the cut-off date for joining the Maoist army. \\xa0An agreement, in other words, was reached that a minor younger than 18 years would not be recognized as a combatant. Using child soldiers in war is a crime even under international laws which deem those leading such wars to have committed a crime.\\nThe Maoists sent a total of 32,350 persons to seven main cantonments and 21 sub-cantonments spread across the country saying they were combatants after the agreement for monitoring of management of the weapons and combatants on December 6, 2006.\\nThe United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) then started the verification process to determine who out of them were combatants, and who were not. Most of them were not combatants and had left the cantonments even before verification. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nA total of 8,640 of those in the cantonments did not even turn up for the second stage of interview for verification of combatants.\\nUNMIN finally verified 19,602 of them to be combatants. Only 17,076 of them were present in the first stage of reclassification.\\nA total of 15,630 Maoist combatants then opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The 4,008 persons who UNMIN verified were not combatants left the cantonments without any payment. Because no agreement said that they would be paid after being found that they were not combatants.\\nHow had they reached the cantonments then?\\nThe number of combatants who had fought in the Maoist armed conflict was actually very low. A video of Maoist supremo Dahal talking about the numbers during a speech in the Shaktikhor cantonment had become public back then. Dahal had conceded in Shaktikhor that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants and taken pride in having been able to keep 30,000-35,000 persons in the cantonments fooling the state. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe 4,008 expelled by UNMIN included their thousands of cadres and their children who were sent to the cantonments by the Maoists saying they would get relief package from the state.\\nMany of those 4,008 expelled by UNMIN saying they were not combatants had not completed 18 years until May 25, 2006. A total of 1,973 were below 18 years while 1,035 others could not prove that they had joined the Maoist army before the cut-off date of May 25, 2006 for joining the Maoist army even though they had completed 18.\\nUNMIN did not even investigate whether the 1,973 minors had joined the Maoist army or not. It first investigated age, and said that those who were underage were not eligible to become combatants without checking when they had been recruited.\\nIt was difficult to go there even for UNMIN because verifying that child soldiers were recruited by the Maoists would have meant that the Maoist leadership had committed the crime of using child soldiers. That would have attracted international laws. UNMIN, therefore, did not venture there, and the Maoist leadership was freed from the accusation of using child soldiers for then.\\nIf the Maoist leadership now insists that they were indeed combatants and participated in the armed conflict and hence should be compensated, that would establish that the Maoists had used child soldiers in the conflict. Is the Maoist leadership ready to face the consequences of accepting to have used child soldiers in the conflict?\\nUNMIN had not strictly investigated even the adult combatants then. Those who could answer a few simple questions were verified to be combatants. Over 19,000 were, therefore, verified to be combatants even though Dahal had conceded in the Shaktikhor video that the Maoists actually had only around 7,000 combatants. The state spent around Rs 20 billion in their management and integration. There was embezzlement of billions in the name of running the Maoist cantonments. The advance of Rs 460 million taken by Maoist leader Krishna Bahadur Mahara for the combatants at cantonments was never reimbursed.\\nEveryone turned a blind eye to that to establish peace in the country and bring the Maoists into the mainstream. How necessary that was would perhaps be evaluated by history.\\nBut the way the Maoists have continued their efforts to dole out taxpayers’ money to their cadres even after joining mainstream politics and 16 years after the peace deal is condemnable.\\nThis is not the first time that attempts have ben made to give those 4,000 persons Rs 200,000 each. The Maoists had first made the attempt in 2012 when its leader Baburam Bhattarai was PM. It was made again when there was a coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) in 2016.\\nFinance Minister Bishnu Paudel in the then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and to those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.\\nThat distribution was stopped when a few NC cadres and conflict victims moved the Supreme Court (SC) against the decision.\\nDahal has now become PM for the third time. It has already been 15 years since he first became PM. It may not have been unnatural for him to have more rebellious attitude and less responsibility toward the state. But the determination showed by Dahal to try to pay his cadres from the state coffers when he has become PM for the third time is irresponsible. It shows that he has failed to understand the sensitivity of current times and his responsibility toward the general public.\\nThe country is currently in a difficult economic situation. Not only Nepal, the whole world is affected by recession. In South Asia, all countries except India are going through a difficult economic situation. Those countries, including Nepal, have taken assistance from the International Monetary Fund to sustain the economy.\\nThe recession has also affected the market and the general public. Many businesses have not been able to pay salaries on time. Many have furloughed their staff. The businesses themselves are in a tight spot as they are not able to pay the bank’s interest. Then there’s the mental stress of those with fixed income who have to pay installments to banks. The government has not been able to collect revenues due to the recession. If the situation worsens further, a situation could arise where it would be difficult to provide salaries to employees and to service debts.\\nWhat message will it send to the general public when the PM wants to dole out nearly a billion rupees from the state coffers to his cadres in the name of combatants at a time when he should be leading the job of extricating the country from this economic challenge?\\nWhat do coalition partner NC and NC leaders who are ironing their daura-suruwals to join the government say about it? On what basis will NC, which was against it when it was in the opposition in the past, support it now? Maybe it will now be opposed by UML, which had tried to provide Rs 200,000 each to these 4,000 people to appease the Maoists by including it in the budget itself. Trust in parties has deteriorated almost to a point of no return because of this double standard.\\nLet’s call a spade a spade, whether in the government or in the opposition.\\nThe Maoists won’t be able to justify in any way the rationale behind their plan to distribute the tax money collected from the public’s hard work to their cadres. There has been no agreement in the past to provide money from the state coffers to those who were not combatants. The Maoists should put a stop to such attempts at recklessly imposing a burden on the state coffers and splurging on its cadres in the name of peace agreement.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nParliamentary system, they say, gives two governments to the voters at one go: one is the government that takes over the reins of power and the other the government-in-waiting.\\nThe government that takes over power performs in accordance with the commitments made to the people. The parliamentary system expects that the government works for the people and their benefits.\\nBut the parties that assume powers do not necessarily always abide by these democratic ideals. They often don't do so going by our own experience. The government has its own interests and compulsions, and the leaders of the parties also have their own agendas and interests. They often put their own agendas above the interests of the people and the country. The government prevails over the people and their fundamental rights at such times, and tries to curtail the people's rights to serve its own interests.\\nThe voters in parliamentary democracy, therefore, also elect the main opposition party or the government-in-waiting to stop such despotic whims of the government. Parliamentary system is such a system of balance that puts the strongest party or coalition in power, and the next strongest party in the opposition so that the despotic whims of the government are challenged; it can strongly stand in the House for the people's rights and their daily lives, and compliance of the Constitution and laws to stop those in power from abusing the Constitution and the laws. \\xa0\\nThe ruling party also fears the opposition party, aware that it is the government-in-waiting. The ruling party is always alert about the possibility of the people bringing it down from power and putting the main opposition party in power in the next election.\\nNepali Congress (NC), which calls itself the defender of parliamentary democracy, has demolished this beautiful balance of power inherent in the parliamentary system.\\nNC President and Parliamentary Party Leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has shirked the immense role and responsibilities of the main opposition party to participate in the unholy wagering for power. Setopati reminds him that the politicians that run away from the august role of the main opposition leader also do not have any moral grounds to take over the reins of power tomorrow.\\nHaving contested the election forging an electoral alliance with the promise of forming the government from the same coalition, Deuba failed to give the government promised to the people. His greed for power was mainly to blame for the unraveling of that coalition after he broke his promise to make CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal prime minister (PM) first and tried to become PM instead, thereby forcing Dahal to take refuge at Balkot. Deuba has again started to wager for power after a new ruling coalition was formed comprising CPN-UML, Maoist Center and five other parties.\\nDeuba and those close to him seem to have hoped for Maoist support during the presidential election for now, and aspired for eventually breaking the current coalition in the long run. The way in which NC leader Ram Chandra Paudel has openly defended the decision to give vote of confidence to Dahal hints as much. The way Paudel has been abandoning his ideals for personal interests in recent times is appalling.\\nDahal also seems to want to have the cake and eat it too by acquiring support from the two parties larger than his. He reached Deuba's new residence at Dhumbarahi after going to KP Sharma Oli's at Balkot as per that strategy.\\nIt is not hard to see through Dahal's strategy of keeping his post safe scaring Oli by showing Deuba and vice versa. The course of this strategy, however, will end after the presidential election. He must choose one out of NC and UML in the presidential election. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNC has deviated from the spirit of the parliamentary system of either forming the government or playing a strong role of opposition respecting the people's mandate at a time when the system has come under vehement attack, and the limits and dignity of democracy have been increasingly crossed by everyone.\\nOur Constitution has not authorized the PM to dissolve the House as long as the final alternative to give the government remains. But Oli twice dissolved the House crossing the limits of the Constitution that he himself prepared with wanton abandon, and the Supreme Court rightly reinstated the House deeming the dissolution unconstitutional on both the occasions.\\nBut Oli shamelessly tried to defend his unconstitutional step of dissolving the House from the rostrum of the very sovereign House on Monday and Tuesday.\\nOn the other hand, President Bidya Devi Bhandari has repeatedly put herself above the Constitution and Parliament. The Constitution has not given her the right to obstruct any work of the Cabinet or defy its decisions. But Bhandari has been sitting on two ordinances passed by the Cabinet. By refusing to authenticate a bill passed by Parliament, she has behaved in a manner to suggest she is above the sovereign Parliament elected by the people.\\nOli, who himself flouted the Constitution, and his party have publicly defended the president’s actions. UML has lost the moral right to protest if a president elected with the support of another party were to disobey the decisions of a government under its leadership tomorrow.\\nThe moral turpitude seen in parties who are major proponents of this system and Constitution during such attacks on the Constitution and the system has become a matter of great concern.\\nParliamentary system becomes strong only when its major stakeholders agree to stay within its boundaries regardless of whether they are in power or out of power, and when they remain devoted to protecting the essence of the system. Those who are the first to violate the Constitution and break the system at the slightest opportunity are the biggest threat to parliamentary system and this Constitution. Unfortunately, Congress has also joined their ranks today.\\nNepali Congress is constantly becoming weaker, both morally and in terms of public support, during the period with the ever power-hungry Deuba as its president.\\nIn the 2017 general election Nepali Congress became the second-largest party in terms of popular votes for the first time in Nepal’s political history. President Deuba defended himself saying UML finished ahead of them on popular votes because of the left alliance even though the popular votes of Nepali Congress had increased.\\nThere was no left alliance in this year’s election. UML had split. CPN (Unified Socialist), which had splintered from UML, received nearly 300,000 votes. But UML still became the largest party in terms of popular votes, finishing ahead of Congress by more than 150,000 votes.\\nNC has been losing the grounds to form a government on its own in recent times due to gradual erosion of its political base. The grand old party looks doomed to losing even the status of main opposition party looking at the people's revulsion toward the NC leadership and its recent misdeeds.\\nThe lawmakers in the party who have yet to lose conscience must, therefore, seriously review the role of NC. They should play the role of a strong opposition in the House relinquishing the rat race for power in the current difficult situation for the parliamentary system if they have even an iota of historical responsibilities of the party. Play that role for safeguarding the people's rights and their interests, at least conserve a party to pin the people's hopes on if they lose trust in the parties in power to ensure that they don't give up on the parliamentary system.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThe people have already elected 165 House of Representatives (HoR) members directly while the process of electing another 110 members through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system is in the final stage. A total of 275 elected lawmakers will enter the HoR in a few weeks to formulate laws for the country through periodic election.\\nThe main tenet of democracy is the people legislating for themselves exercising that sovereign right through their representatives.\\nThe elected people's representatives form the government to work for the people and formulate laws to bind that government and the general public. Nobody is above those laws and there is rule of law in the country. The biggest importance and spirit of modern democracy is vested in that.\\nThe gerontocratic leaders of old parties with longevity like that of the sun and the moon who cannot see anything but power and do not care about any norms and limits of democracy have been repeatedly attacking this spirit. This has happened once again.\\nBut the issue is graver than those of yesterday because a new government is going to be formed after the previous mandate expired. New lawmakers have been elected as people's representatives. The government formed as per the previous mandate and already past expiry date has amended an important criminal law through an ordinance with utter disregard for them. The law of the land does not allow the government to withdraw cases of grave crimes sub judice in the court. The court has repeatedly cautioned the government through its orders and verdicts in that regard.\\nThe place to discuss and debate about the matter if someone in special circumstances is hard done by the prevailing laws and court precedents, and to amend them is the House elected by the people. The ordinance brought by the government now, therefore, is not right in the crucible of time, people's mandate, Constitution, laws or political morality. The government should, therefore, take back this ordinance.\\nThere are many dimensions to the issue of 'bringing this ordinance for justice to' Resham Chaudhary, who has been jailed for almost five years, and other political rebels.\\nFirst things first, this ordinance has not been brought to ensure justice for Chaudhary. The government could have taken the bill related to the issue to the previous HoR if it genuinely felt that Chaudhary suffered injustice. This government has been in power for around one and a half years and had a clear majority in the previous House. The current ordinance has come as a bargaining tool for power. It has been brought to solicit Chaudhary's support in mustering a majority for the ruling coalition in the newly elected House. This quid pro quo will further complicate the issue of 'injustice' to Chaudhary, and will condemn him to further injustice.\\nChaudhary is facing a court case as one of the main accused of the Tikapur incident in which eight police personnel including an SSP of Nepal Police and a toddler were lynched on August 24, 2015. He has been claiming that he was outside Tikapur on that day and he did not have anything to do with the attack on the police.\\nThe then government had formed a judicial commission under former Supreme Court (SC) justice Girish Chandra Lal to find facts about the incident after thorough investigation. And that commission submitted its report almost five years back. The government has changed many times in the intervening period but the government has yet to make that report public.\\nChaudhary's supporters claim that the report does not implicate Chaudhary in the Tikapur incident as the court case filed by the government contends, and many feel that he has been unjustly implicated and jailed. The government has supported these claims by not making the report public.\\nA large chunk of the Tharu community genuinely feels that Chaudhary is suffering injustice due to the shady character of the major political parties that say one thing when they are in power and quite another while in the opposition. This grievance of the Tharu community has manifested in this election. Nagarik Unmukti Party, registered under the leadership of Chaudhary's wife Ranjeeta Shrestha, has won three HoR seats under the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) electoral system while the party's Lalbir Chaudhary has been elected as an independent candidate from Bardiya-2 after filing rebel candidacy. The party has won 12 seats in the provincial assembly and has secured almost 300,000 votes in the PR electoral system for HoR. This shows the sympathy of the Tharu community toward Resham Chaudhary and the degree of their displeasure toward the case filed against him.\\nThe newly elected House cannot ignore the issue. It is the responsibility of the new House to study the Lal report, explore the additional aspects of the Tikapur incident, and prepare legal grounds and way toward justice for him if it concludes that he indeed has suffered injustice.\\nThe new House can grant justice to Chaudhary in the true sense only by amending the law completing due procedures if he has suffered injustice, and acquit him of the allegations slapped against him. He will be deemed offender by a large chunk of the people if he is released through the ordinance as part of the quid pro quo for the government. That will be a bigger injustice to him. We, therefore, also urge him to not stress on the horse trading for government.\\nAs far as the leaders of the ruling parties are concerned, they have been found repeatedly wanting on the issue of democratic processes and rule of law. Every leader of big parties has made a mockery of rule of law and abused the laws for vested interests while in the government. Ordinance, which is brought at the time of emergency or absence of House for essential works that must be done, has been turned into a tool of rulers for their vested interests.\\nThere are rising aspirations of the people, especially the younger generation, that there is exercise of advanced democracy, rule of law, and democracy does not turn into an armor to cover up the caprices of those in power. The new generation has delivered that very message by establishing new parties in the recent HoR election.\\nThe archaic leaders of the old parties have been repeatedly proving how alienated they are from these aspirations by bringing such ordinances. They will perhaps continue that until they are displaced.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe Election Commission has asked Setopati through an email to remove a news report published on Friday within 24 hours. We had published a news titled ‘Agni Kharel’s son Nishan in US Army, also continues to hold Nepali citizenship’ on Friday. The Election Commission on Saturday has asked for removal of the news report within 24 hours and sought explanation stating ‘There was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation’.\\nThe letter issued by the Election Commission has yet to arrive in Setopati. We will decide whether to directly move the court to seek legal remedy or furnish explanation to the Election Commission once we receive the letter. We firmly believe that the Election Commission has instructed for removal of the news violating the limits and decorum of a constitutional commission on an issue it is not concerned with.\\nWe have four major disagreements over the instruction by the Election Commission to remove the news and explanation it has sought.\\nFirst, the Election Commission has sought explanation on one hand while it has instructed to remove the news without waiting for that explanation on the other. This behavior of the Election Commission is ill-intentioned and unfortunate in itself.\\nThe second is about its allegation that there was character assassination of an individual who is candidate in the election and his family, and the news report has been published in a way that there is personal allegation.\\nThe news report published in Setopati mentions that Agni Kharel’s son Nishan Kharel serves in the US Army, and he still holds Nepali citizenship certificate and is included in the voter list. Both of those are facts. The Election Commission itself can check with its voter list. Our news report mentions that Agni Kharel himself has told Seopati that his son Nishan has been serving in the US Army for seven years.\\nWe want to ask the Election Commission—how does this news report slander Agni Kharel who is candidate in the election, and his family? How is it an allegation?\\nThe Election Commission instead has publicly slandered us by making such false allegations against Setopati. We challenge the Election Commission to prove this allegation, and request it to withdraw the same if it can’t.\\nWe are clear that Nishan Kharel or any other Nepali reserves the rights to serve in the US or British or Indian army, or army or other security force of other countries, and it is a matter of individual choice for the person concerned.\\nSetopati stands for personal freedom of any individual. We don’t believe that moral questions can ever be asked of anyone on the basis of whether the person stays in Nepal or abroad, or serves in the Nepal Army or army of another country. People take decisions on the basis of their convenience and wish in different situations, and act accordingly. It is their individual and sovereign right if the decisions they take or their action do not harm others and do not violate the laws. We always respect those rights, and will always strive to protect those rights.\\nWe also believe that the fact that a family member of a big leader or those who hold a major public position serves in a foreign army is a matter of interest for commoners, and hence a subject of news. We have, therefore, published the news of Nishan Kharel.\\nThose serving in the US Army should at least have permission for permanent residency in America. The person can easily acquire US citizenship after serving in the US Army. Nishan, who has been serving for seven years, should relinquish Nepali citizenship if he has acquired US citizenship. Not doing so would be against the laws of Nepal. We had asked Nishan’s father Agni whether Nishan has acquired US citizenship or not as he still holds Nepali citizenship. He could not say about Nishan’s US citizenship with certainty. We have also included Agni’s response in the news report. It is unfortunate that a constitutional body like the Election Commission has made allegations against a news story that we have reported complying with the decorum of journalism and completing due processes.\\nThird, this news is not related to the upcoming elections. It, therefore, does not attract the election code of conduct, nor can the Election Commission instruct for removal of the news citing the code of conduct. The Election Commission is not the authorized body to seek explanation about the news published by any media house or instruct for its removal.\\nFourth, this is not the first time the Election Commission has sought clarification from Setopati in the name of election code of conduct. During the last local elections held in May, too, the Election Commission had sought clarification from us and instructed us to remove an election-related news. We had sent our clarification to the Election Commission refusing to remove the news.\\nThat time the Election Commission had accused Setopati of violating the code of conduct by publishing election analyses based on conversations with voters of different local bodies. We were clear then and we are clear today as well that a voter has the right to privacy regarding who they want to vote for in an election. They need not reveal why they would or would not vote for somebody.\\nAlso, voters also have the right to freedom of expression to publicly state why they would or would not vote for a candidate. Not only that, citizens also have the right to be politically organized, solicit votes for a political party and organize rallies.\\nSimilarly, if any citizen tells a journalist without hesitation why she would or would not vote for somebody, what politician she likes or doesn’t like, whom she wants to help get elected or defeated, then a media house has the right to publish it. The Constitution itself has guaranteed that right and also defined its limits.\\nIf it deems it necessary to ban the press from writing on something not prohibited by the Constitution and justifies that, then the legislature should formulate a law for it. The Election Commission cannot prepare a code of conduct that prohibits writing on issues not prohibited by the Constitution and the laws. The Election Commission’s code of conduct is not a law. We have already stated this in our earlier written clarification to the Election Commission.\\nTherefore, we urge the Election Commission to not discourage the press time and again, in the name of code of conduct, from reporting citizens’ views on political parties and leaders. We would also like to remind the Election Commission that such an act goes against the constitutional rights of citizens and the press.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nOn October 22 and 23, the Nepal Army (NA) organized a crucially important program to reflect on Nepal’s contribution to UN peace operations (PO). One of the several activities of the celebration was a seminar titled “Emerging capability requirements for UN Peace Operations and way forward” on October 23 at the NA headquarters where UN Under Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix virtually addressed the gathering. Chief Secretary of the Government of Nepal, NA Chief, and Military Advisor of the Secretary General of the UN and Nepal delegation head General Birame Diop were the other key persons to address the august gathering.\\nThere were four presentations (3 from UN and 1 from NA) where I was also invited to make comments on presentations of two UN officials—“Developing and deploying capability needs for protection mandates” by Oliver Ulich (Deputy Representative UNHQ) and “Recommendations for TCCs like Nepal for generating and deploying suitable capabilities in UN Peace Operations” by Major General Hugh Van Roosen (retired).\\nThe NA deserves special appreciation for organizing this very timely and highly relevant seminar and reflecting on our contribution to global peace, security and stability. It is equally important to critically look at what Nepal gained from this engagement and whether it is equitable compared to its contribution. Are we able to exhaust the potential for positioning Nepal as a champion of peacekeeping at the global level? What do we have to do to maximize our leverage and potential in this context and what should the UN think regarding the existing provisions of Troop and Police Contributing Countries (TPCC) in general and Nepal in particular?\\nBeing a Nepali, I am very proud of the great contribution of our peacekeepers to maintaining international peace and security, one of the very foundational reasons of establishment of the UN in 1945, immediately after the Second World War by 51 countries.\\nThat a Nepali peacekeepr accompanied the then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan to receive the Nobel Peace Prize for the UN in 2001 is evidence of the importance of Nepali peacekeepers in the UN and the contribution of Nepal to the UN peace mission.\\nNepal has gained unique experiences by engaging in achieving stability and peace in highly unstable countries like Lebanon, Iraq, Mali, South Sudan, DRC, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, Syria, Israel, Western Sahara, South Sudan and many others, thereby providing us with a powerful negotiation tool with the UN for expanded engagement in the future.\\nAccording to a recently (on the seminar) unveiled coffee-table book about Nepal’s contribution to the UN by the NA, more than 140,000 Nepali troops have engaged in 43 UN peacekeeping missions around the world so far. At present, about 5,623 Nepali men and women are serving in 12 peacekeeping missions in different parts of the world.\\nFurther, Nepal is one of the only two TPCCs that have formed military units in all protection of civilian (POC) missions. This also shows the commitment of Nepal toward the global peace and stability mission of the UN.\\nSo far, Peace Operation (PO) of the UN is largely guided by narrow, top-down headquarters, and the burden loaded on TPCCs (for example, capability needs for protection mandates to be arranged on their own), which needs to be changed to become more relevant. Nepal being the second largest contributor to UN peacekeeping, this is a direct concern. Capabilities for protection should not limit to training, units and equipment, and personnel which UN is advocating but also include commitment of international support. Only then can it be termed “Whole-of-Mission Approach” and it should always cover all four protection mandates (protection of civilians, child protection, conflict-related sexual violence, and human rights).\\nEven though the three tiers of POC concepts—dialogue and engagement; physical protection; and establishment of protective environment—are pragmatic, it is essential to add security governance and civil military relations in the third component ‘establishment of protective environment’, to enhance trust, ownership and gain local support.\\nOne of the weak concepts used in the UN military component about responsibilities at the strategic level is ‘Do No Harm’, which is a contextual operational concept developed by Mary Anderson in 1999 in the conflict-affected development context. The UN PO must strategically expand it to “Do Good” as the POC mandate itself is for doing good. Though the Action for Peace+ of the SG emphasizes on “Systemwise Digital Transformation Strategy” as a capacity tool for protection mandate, incorporating early warning and forecasting digital system deserves further consideration.\\nBased on the experiences of more than six decades of engagement of the NA in UN peace missions, it is the right time to holistically review and address the concerns raised in this paper.\\nThe Government of Nepal must expand its engagement with the UN for maintaining international peace and security, developing friendly relations among nations and promoting social progress, better living standards and human rights, a very foundational aim of creation of the UN. It will be a win-win result for both Nepal and the UN. The following are some of the possible ways forward.\\n\\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) must focus on expanding its sphere of influence for which we have three major potential areas.\\n\\nFirst, Nepal has a great scope of positioning itself as a champion of global climate change debate because glacier melts and related crisis in the Hindukush Himalayas are global concerns. Hence, Nepal must globally and proactively engage on the issues of climate change and related insecurities.\\nSecond, we have Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha. Nepal’s meaningful and strategic proactive engagement with Buddhist countries will provide a large number of tourists to Lumbini to noticeably enhance our economy.\\xa0 These two issues are not direct concerns of this paper and I am not going to discuss it further.\\nThe third and the most important one is expanding Nepal’s engagement in UNPO by a) increasing total number of troops aiming to be the top TPCC, b) providing a higher number of female peacekeepers, c) ensuring more officers in senior positions (eg force commanders) and d) sending civilian experts (eg on rule of law, justice, human rights, women empowerment, ceasefire monitoring, post conflict reconstruction, etc).\\nAchieving these points will not be easy. The MoFA must send capable UN representatives with a higher profile, better negotiation skills, full commitment and a desire to work hard to achieve them. It may require continuous, proactive and meaningful dialogue and negotiation with the UN Secretary General, Security Council and its members, members of General Assembly, and UN representatives of other countries.\\n\\nSimilarly, the Ministry of Defense must work hard to create a favorable domestic environment for achieving the points listed above. The NA has already offered to send 10,000 troops and must be ready and it must be realized as soon as practically feasible. By expanding our peacekeepers, Nepal will gain more experiences and expand the zone of influence in international peace and stability.\\nThe Ministry of Finance must ensure financial provisions for armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other logistics on par with the standard of other TPCCs.\\nThe NA must make sure that the police and soldiers deployed in French and Spanish-speaking countries get language training before their deployment.\\nThe UN in general and UNSG and Department of Peace Operations in particular should categorize member countries into groups regarding the PO:\\nTroops and Police Contributing Countries (TPCCs) (who are providing a large number of troops),\\nCapability Contributing Countries (CCC) who are not providing a significant number of troops. They have to be responsible for capabilities and logistics (like airlifting planes, armored vehicles, training, information and technology, and so on).\\nRegarding the contribution of peacekeepers from Nepal, there is no representation of senior officials proportional to the troops (there are only 6 Force Commanders so far). Therefore, the UN must seriously rethink it and make sure that recruitment of senior officers is commensurate with peacekeepers (also necessary for equity). Nepal has proved and gained international repute as a country committed to upholding the principles outlined in the UN Charter and the UN must, therefore, consider this concern.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the UN as well as the member states, especially resourceful countries who have the responsibility to maintain international peace and stability as per the UN Charter, have to rethink PO in the changing global context and ensure fairness to TPCCs, recognize the contribution of certain countries like Nepal in fulfilling objectives of the UN to keep international peace and stability. Hence, Nepal must provide space to increase peacekeepers, senior officials and civilian officials.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nEvery post has its decorum and dignity. The post of president as a head of state also has its own decorum and dignity. The dignity of that post is related to the duties defined by the Constitution.\\n“Compliance and protection of the Constitution shall be the main duties of the President,” Article 61(4) of the Constitution states.\\nThe oath of office and secrecy administered to the president also mentions, “Remaining completely faithful to the Constitution of Nepal…under prevailing laws…will perform with sincerity.”\\nPresident Bidya Devi Bhandari has failed in the main duty prescribed by the Constitution, and destroyed the decorum and dignity of the post of president.\\nThere is a constitutional provision allowing the president to send back any bill submitted for authentication by the sovereign parliament for reconsideration. But the president must authenticate the bill within 15 days if the House again sends it to the president. She did not have any alternative to that and authenticating the Citizenship Bill was her constitutional duty.\\nSome legal professionals have argued that the Citizenship Bill has also automatically become inactive once the term of the House of Representatives (HoR) expired, and the president need not authenticate it. But that is not true.\\n“If the session ends when a Bill is still under consideration, the next session may take over the procedure.\\nProvided that, if a Bill is presented to the House of Representatives and is under consideration, or it is sent to National Assembly after passing it, but if the House of Representatives is dissolved while the Bill is still under consideration in the National Assembly, or if its tenure comes to an end, such Bill shall be considered not effective,” states Article 111(10) of the Constitution.\\nThe Citizenship Bill was not under consideration in any House, and was submitted to the president after being endorsed by both the HoR and the National Assembly. The Constitution and laws do not envision any bill passed by both the HoR and the National Assembly becoming inactive. The Constitution, similarly, also does not envision the president not authenticating the bill sent to the president for the second time.\\nThe president’s step, therefore, has raised serious questions about the Constitution and system. Can an individual who does not obey the Constitution continue as president or not? If we assume she can, then it will create a wrong precedent for those becoming president in the coming days. What will happen if a future president also defies any decision taken by the government or the parliament?\\nWe will then be forced to wait anxiously whether the president will authenticate any bill sent after being passed by the House, whether the president will endorse the decision taken by the Cabinet or not. We will, in other words, reach a situation where the president, and not the parliament or the Cabinet with majority in that parliament, will exercise the sovereign powers of the people. That will vitiate our system in an irrevocable manner. That will afflict every prime minister that comes after election in the future and the parliamentary system. Every party that can get into the government will be eventually afflicted.\\nThere is, therefore, the need for rule-based and long-term treatment of the arbitrariness displayed by the president now. One may say “The president did not honor the Constitution, we will also not honor the president.” Or even inform that the bill automatically comes into effect by publishing it in the Nepal Gazette. But that would be a response in rage. Anger does not make the Constitution and system stronger.\\nIt is necessary to once again move the court to protect the Constitution and system, and to make them stronger, to take the president who has deviated from her responsibilities and constitutional duties to the dock of the court.\\nThe court has already corrected President Bhandari for not fulfilling her constitutional duties appropriately. She had refused to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the prime minister in accordance to Article 76(5) of the Constitution after 149 HoR members wrote to her to that regard defying the rights of the HoR to elect PM. The Supreme Court after a long hearing issued a mandamus instructing her to appoint Deuba as PM and administer oath of office and secrecy within 24 hours.\\nThe SC, definitely, would look at this issue if anyone moves the court demanding that the president be asked to fulfill her constitutional duties. The court has already interpreted clearly that judicial remedy can be sought for presidential acts saying that the provision prohibiting filing of court cases against the president for works done in capacity of the president is limited only up to prohibiting making the president personally liable. But there remains no such limits about examination of the legal validity of the questions raised about use and implementation of the constitutional rights and provisions by the president.\\nThat court verdict adds that no state official remains above the law or beyond the purview of law in a constitutional system incorporating democratic norms and values, and in rule of law. It reminds that keeping all presidential decisions beyond the purview of legal examination would ultimately lead to arbitrariness and autocracy. \\xa0\\nThis precedent clearly shows that the court can look at the dereliction of the constitutional duty by the president in not authenticating the Citizenship Bill.\\nIt is necessary to take this issue to the court and conclude it there to show constitutional limits to the president who displayed arbitrariness by not authenticating the bill submitted to her after being passed by the parliament, and also to remind her successors about those limits.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has been sending police and staffers with excavators in tow in the Hattisar area, where Tukucha has been put through an underground tunnel, for the past few days. They have been digging the ground in private houses of individuals and companies, demolishing walls, and threatening and instructing the owners to remove the structures. Owners of the houses and the land have been saying they have not encroached the land, rather procured it by completing legal procedures, built houses in accordance to the designs passed by the KMC and acquired documents of completing construction. With documents and evidence in hand, they have been pleading with the KMC to have a look at those documents. But the police and KMC staffers deployed on the field with excavators have not listened to their pleadings. They have been evading the owners saying, “Don’t tell us, ask engineers, and those above us.” And threatening that the houses will be demolished if found above the tunnel through which Tukucha is flowing.\\nA team of police and staffers reached the residence of 82-year-old Sharada Manandhar at Hattisar with excavators on Monday, shut the compound gate that was open, and then brought the gate down with the excavator. She had rented a small truss-structure inside the compound to a coffee house for the past four years. That was an additional source of income on top of her government pension. The KMC ordered her to demolish the structure stating that it is above Tukucha and warned that they will run the excavator if it is not demolished. The tenant has vacated the coffee house after KMC’s threats.\\nThe police and KMC staffers are not to blame for all this, and its main leadership—Mayor Balen Shah—is the one responsible. He doesn’t want to check the facts of Hattisar, nor is he ready to listen to the locals. Yogesh Mishra, a local, met Shah at his office armed with documents and evidence, and tried to brief him about the facts but Shah was uninterested in his efforts, Mishra claims.\\nThe KMC has started to display the brutality of excavators instead of looking at the facts and evidence presented by the locals, and presenting its own evidence to show that the locals have encroached the land.\\nWhat is this attitude showed by the KMC leadership, its police and staffers? It is necessary to call and define this mentality for what it is. This is blatant thuggery. The state’s thuggery over the law-abiding citizens is an unpardonable crime in democracy. And this crime needs to stop immediately.\\nThe facts that we have unearthed, our conversation with locals of Hattisar, and the documents and evidence they have clearly show that they have not encroached the land. This is ancestral property of some; others had legally procured the land only some time back and built houses there. The land there has been sold and procured at government offices for years. Those who have built houses and other structures have done so after passing the design through the KMC and taking permission from other bodies concerned.\\nThe land in Hattisar was never under government ownership. The land was owned by local farmers when the then Rana prime minister Bir Shumsher decided to put the Tukucha flowing out from the southern wall of the Narayanhiti Palace inside a tunnel 130 years ago. Historical documents have proved that the Ranas had acquired the land at Rs 200 per ropani. They constructed the underground tunnel for Tukucha and built a spacious ground by filling the tunnel but they never brought that land under the state’s ownership. That land was eventually distributed among Bir Shumsher’s children. Some of the plots there are still owned by Bir Shumsher’s descendants. Others have been transferred to the current owners after legal transactions.\\nThe most important thing is, the land was surveyed in 1975. The map prepared then does not mention Tukucha. Not many may have remembered the Tukucha that was sent underground more than 80 years earlier. The state may also not have deemed it necessary to keep Tukucha in the map.\\nTo say that the owners should have known about the Tukucha that was never mentioned in government map, and accuse them of encroaching the land over Tukucha and building houses is sheer insanity. The KMC has been doing precisely that now. To try to remove the locals from there through threats and excavator terror without completing any legal process and provision of compensation is an unthinkable act by the state. The Constitution has granted inviolable rights to property for the citizens. The excavators sent by Balen Shah cannot violate that, nor can the state take an ax to the private property of citizens without paying appropriate compensation.\\nThe land and houses are not just physical properties for the people. They are connected with the person’s and her family’s love, sweat and many memories, and self-respect. The place is beloved for every individual with special importance and prestige. Where does the KMC get the rights to deploy excavators on such places without their permission when they have not committed any offense? Which morality granted that? Those hurting the self-respect of citizens by deploying excavators are liable for punishment in rule of law. Our law also deems attack on others’ properties a punishable offense.\\nThere seems to be a frightening tendency now. A few individuals seem to be happy when the state has attacked others' properties. It is the nature of the crowd to take sadistic pleasure at the sufferings of others. That is understandable. But another dangerous tendency can also be seen in the Nepali society now—not speaking and writing against wrong deeds of Balen Shah due to his popularity. The victims of Hattisar have met Kathmandu lawmakers and leaders of parties and briefed their grievances. But the leaders have expressed helplessness saying, “We cannot speak against Balen Shah at such times.”\\nExpressing their helplessness, the victims say, “Politicians don’t listen to us, the media doesn’t write about us. What justice would the court provide during such a time?”\\nSome state bodies appear hesitant to fulfill their responsibilities. For example, it has come to light that the Tukucha tunnel was built 130 years ago by Bir Shumsher. Many say it was an amazing example of engineering for that period. The fact that the great earthquakes of 1934 and 2015 could not inflict any damage to the underground tunnel also clearly shows how strong the structure was built. Therefore, it is our heritage of historical and archeological importance that shows the engineering technology of the Rana period. According to law, no structure older than 100 years can be altered or demolished. It can only be altered under the supervision of the Department of Archaeology. The law has given that authority to the Department of Archeology. But the department seems reluctant to fulfill its responsibilities. It has remained silent even when the KMC’s excavators have been digging up such an old heritage every day. It has not even bothered to go and inspect the sites of excavation.\\nIf society starts bowing down to populism like this, then democracy will start losing its essence. Therefore, it is necessary to speak and write about this injustice meted out by the KMC to the citizens so that those who are facing injustice do not lose their hope for justice. A democratic society is also a society that puts faith in justice in each other. Those who face the wrath of the state are left alone only in an autocratic society, where everyone fears the state.\\nThankfully, there is also a good side to a populist wave—populism is usually short-lived. And people in a democratic society will challenge it sooner or later.\\nWhat now?\\r\\nFirst of all, the thuggery needs to be stopped. The KMC needs to bring the excavator terror to an end and stop threatening the citizens.\\nAnd the KMC should discuss the issue with a cool mind in its executive meeting, and take decision in light of the facts that have come to the fore. It should consider whether the Tukucha tunnel has to be demolished or not? The settlement of Hattisar has to be displaced or not? The cost for doing so, the return on the expenses incurred, and whether that can be justified considering other glaring priorities of the KMC?\\nThere will be debate in the media and the civil society on what to do about Tukucha, and whether to revive it or not. People will put their own positions on different aspects of the issue. That is inseparable and essential in a democratic society. That will bring many aspects of the disputed issue to the fore, and help the decision-makers take decision. But the sovereign rights to take a call rest on them in capacity of the elected people’s representatives. The Constitution has provisions specifying what the local government, the provincial government and the federal government can do. Everyone should fulfill one’s responsibility accordingly.\\nIf the settlement has to be evacuated, the KMC must hold friendly dialogue with the locals about compensation. They should not be treated like enemies. Both the sides should agree and move forward accordingly. The Government of Nepal should take decision in accordance to the Land Acquisition Act if there is no such agreement, and pay compensation accordingly. And move the works forward.\\nNo government has the authority to ignore the laws, processes and regulations, and unleash excavators on an individual’s property taking a mob, threaten the citizens and oppress them. That is not accepted in a civilized and democratic society.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nReporting of incidents of sexual assaults in Nepal has increased significantly in the last 10 years. More survivors are opening up as a result of social media\\'s growth and the global #MeToo movement. Such violations have a wider impact than is generally thought. Cases of sexual abuse also have an underlying effect on mental health, in addition to the legal and socioeconomic repercussions. To comprehend how such events worsen survivors\\' mental health, sufficient research and studies have not been conducted.\\nA 24-year-old girl from Baglung in western Nepal was frequently raped by her father-in-law for a few years. Her husband was abroad for employment during that period. When this incident came out, her father-in-law accused her of infidelity and questioned her \"character\". Though authorities are investigating this matter, her mental health has deteriorated to the point that she has lost most of her senses.\\nDelay in filing cases for these crimes has deteriorated many survivors\\' mental health, according to journalist Nisha Oli. The majority of survivors take their time opening up. Their mental health is further hampered by this delay.\\nThe road to rehabilitation is not easy, she continues. Most of the time, survivors are unaware of the necessity. Additionally, there are no agencies or groups that serve as mediators to ease the changeover. Although we are not professionals, I have observed various psychiatric issues among survivors. We can only help them along. The predicament is alarming.\\nWhile every instance of sexual abuse is unique, the effects it has on women and girls are often the same.\\nA 25-year-old traumatized survivor is now residing at a hostel in Kathmandu. The abuser has fled, and she is a long way from receiving justice. Her life has been turned upside down. Her life has changed since her mother passed away. Her father soon moved on after getting remarried. She is living alone now that her grandmother has passed away. For her, this was not the end.\\nShe was assaulted at the home of a relative. Nobody believed her. Rather, she was blamed by many. At that point, everything for her was altered. She has been experiencing mental, physical, social, and psychological difficulties for the past nine years. She started to get suicidal tendencies. She spoke about the events in a very frank manner, unlike the majority of survivors.\\nHer attempts to get assistance were unsuccessful. However, neither the police nor the public gave her any credit. She contacted many groups, but none of them were able to assist. Organizations like the National Women’s Commission and Maiti Nepal responded in a lukewarm and disappointing manner. They also made fun of her for having mental health issues. They heightened the suffering. Numerous survivors have similar life experiences. Commission employees treat survivors like animals. They torture sufferers instead of offering consolation and compassion. There are numerous instances of survivors who have made it to Anuradha Koirala, the founder of Maiti Nepal, and then returned home sobbing. One of the survivors declared, \"All that glitters is not gold.”\\nMany of the responsible groups have utterly failed in this regard. These groups frequently throw temper tantrums, including berating, requesting that survivors contact the police or bring attorneys, and refusing to offer assistance. The persistent lack of empathy displayed by these institutions hurts the survivors. According to many analysts, social organizations and government entities are found wanting on this issue. Simply put, there is a lack of knowledge, urgency, and priority.\\nJournalist Nisha Oli claims that survivors have access to safe shelters. These safe houses offer lodging, help with processing abortions, and limited therapy. However, there are little long-term benefits from short-term counseling. According to Nisha, counseling should not only concentrate on giving support but also assist in the development of life skills. These skills bring financial independence and respect.\\nA Nepali girl claimed a few months ago on her Instagram and Tiktok pages that she had experienced several rapes and other forms of torture. She went on to say that the trauma caused by these sexual assaults had ruined her life and left her with despair, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\\nShe revealed the abuser\\'s identity and the circumstances she had to deal with after numerous instances of sexual assault in a video that was posted on TikTok and Instagram. There was widespread outrage over this across the nation. Massive rallies and demonstrations demanding justice for her were held in its wake. Her candor inspired many women and girls to talk about their traumatic experiences. The parliament heard debates over the statute of limitations for such crimes.The struggle against sexual assault has gained the much-needed spark.\\nThe case, according to many experts, is just the beginning. The number of sexual assault cases that have been reported has sharply increased in recent years; 2144 and\\xa02230 rape cases were reported in the fiscal years 2018–2019 and 2019–2020, respectively. There were 981 instances in the fiscal year 2014–2015, marking a 10-year high for the number. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, 7% of women and girls (15–49) nationwide have reported experiencing sexual assault at some point in their lives. Even if the rates are rising, it is believed that they are actually even higher. Many women have been forced to keep such crimes to themselves due to the sensitive nature of crime.\\nDue to survivors\\' lack of knowledge about their legal rights and the lack of assistance they receive from friends and family, most of such incidents of sexual assault go unreported or remain secret. Instead of demanding retribution from the offender, many times survivors are questioned about their character instead. As a result, the judicial procedure rarely takes place and most of the time, offenders get away scot free.\\nThe mental health support group Umanga Nepal carried out a poll on a small sample of women. Eighteen adolescent girls were surveyed, and the results showed that 15 of them experienced various forms of sexual abuse. Rape, attempted rape, sexual harassment, and sexual misbehavior were all covered. The majority of them experienced maltreatment as children, and they are still traumatized by it. In most cases, family members, friends, coworkers, boyfriends, and strangers were the culprits. Nine of the 18 females experienced abuse in their own homes when aged 10-14 years from family members and neighbors.\\nThe majority of them struggle with anxiety, sleep problems, trauma, and challenges of trust. Their relationships and profession have both been harmed by this. Their confidence and aspirations have been destroyed by the trauma of such an event. Many of the victims have not yet sought legal representation or confronted their abusers. Social hierarchies and taboos are to blame to this. Fears of judgment, marginalization, and victimization are just a few among them. The majority of poll respondents experience guilt, shame, and panic. They are all guilty of self-blame. Survivors of sexual abuse are frequently at risk for mental health problems because of the trauma brought on by such occurrences and the self-deprecating emotions they elicit.\\nSexual-abuse survivors are more prone to experiencing traumatic disorders and trust issues, according to psychotherapist Sita Lama from Mann Ka Kura, who has experience of working with trafficked girls and women. The majority of them are compelled to live with the trauma because they are reluctant to discuss freely about their mental health due to their family history, fear of criticism, and fear of being judged.\\nShe concurs that it takes time for those who have experienced molestation during their formative years or at any other time to open up and find courage. Even if they do open up, they are uncomfortable conversing. In a few instances, people arrive looking for assistance for their \"friends.\" But the majority of the time, it\\'s their own tale.\\n“Even if they visit us, they are not at ease. Counselors must speak to clients in a way that encourages them to open up and begin believing in us. Some of them crumble and despise their own bodies,” she continues.\\nThe slogan, according to Lama, is \"It\\'s not our fault.\" Acknowledging pain is the first step on the road to recovery. Dance therapy, behavior therapy, and art therapy can all aid with trauma reduction. However, recovery takes time. It won\\'t happen overnight. Every instruction must be followed. It takes some time to find the wound and heal it.\\nWhen we respect and cherish our bodies, we can communicate with them mentally and emotionally. We are not to blame for anything that has happened to us in the past. In light of this, Lama considers loving and caring for the body to be one of the most crucial tasks.\\nTrauma is merely the beginning of the agony trail. Substance misuse is one of the main effects of such trauma. Most survivors take this route to get away from their experience. One of the survey\\'s survivors related a similar experience. Drunken urges to temporarily flee are very likely. Many survivors still take drugs despite being aware of their negative effects. Unprescribed medications are more hazardous than helpful, as has been universally accepted and empirically demonstrated.\\nSexual assault cases are not limited by gender or color. It has received a lot of discussion and condemnation. Studies and research of various kinds are being conducted. According to a study by Boston-based Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health professor Karestan Koenen, sexual assault and harassment \"often take a significant long-term toll on a victim\\'s mental and physical health, increasing the risk for not only depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but also high blood pressure and sleep loss.\"\\n\"Not everyone who has been assaulted or harassed will endure persistent and lifelong repercussions. Being surrounded by a lot of supportive social networks can be beneficial for some people,\" she claimed. But a lot of folks aren\\'t, Koenen continued. “Many women avoid discussing their experiences with others, often for years, out of concern that they won\\'t be believed or that they would be referred to as \"nuts\" or \"sluts.\" They, therefore, keep a secret from others, which wears them down over time and prevents them from receiving the assistance they require. Additionally, these encounters are extremely taxing on a bodily and psychological level.\"\\nSexual assault instances come in a variety of forms, according to Ram Pukar Shah, a clinical psychologist at Kanti Bal Hospital and CEO of the Subha Mangal Group. Some individuals discover the information after the fact.\\n\"Our conversations are private. We start by getting a better grasp of the clients\\' behavior, interests, and character attributes. We don\\'t rush because it\\'s a delicate subject and it takes victims a long time to open up. We start by diagnosing the problems, whether they are anxiety, PTSD, or depression.\\n“Sometimes it\\'s necessary to refer a patient to a psychiatrist and prescribe medicine as well, allowing therapy and medication to work in concert. We try several approaches based on the situation and the severity of the condition. There is therapy for trauma. We have to convince them that they are secure.\\n“Some survivors recover on their own with counseling, while others require behavioral therapy. Multiple abuse victims require extra time to recover. However, developing trust with your therapist or counselor is a crucial step.\\n“However, psychological counseling and therapy are still in their infancy in a nation like Nepal. The industry has come under fire for lacking professionalism and accessibility. Whoever is sincere and nonjudgmental is a true professional,” Shah continues.\\n(The Author is a freelance writer and mental health advocate based in Kathmandu, Nepal @RisalShiksha)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDipendra Kunwar has been promoted to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) of the Armed Police Force (APF) in a way that he is ranked top from his batch.\\nHe has not topped his batch due to his capabilities. He is not only incapable compared to others from his batch but was not even eligible to be recommended for promotion now. But he has been recommended as the highest ranked among his batch mates after pulling strings due to his relation with the political leadership at Baluwatar.\\nKunwar is the husband of Bhanu Deuba’s sister. Bhanu Deuba is the nephew and personal secretary of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba. Kunwar, who has been recommended for promotion to SSP, in this way is the son-in-law of PM Deuba.\\nHe has been pushed forward in a fraudulent manner in a way that he becomes APF chief in the future because he is a relative of the Deuba family.\\nThe promotion committee under the Home Ministry chaired by the Home Secretary decided to recommend 14 Superintendents of Police (SP) to SSP on Friday. Kunwar has been ranked second overall behind Praveen Kandel, who joined the APF from the Nepal Police and is set to retire soon, and top among his batch mates.\\nThe APF regulation, which required APF personnel to serve for at least four years in a position to become eligible for promotion in the APF, was amended for Kunwar’s promotion. Kunwar would complete four years as Superintendent of Police (SP) only in April 2023. So, the government amended the regulation on July 6 and changed the eligibility to three years.\\nKunwar had joined the APF as inspector on March 21, 2003. He was ranked toward the bottom of the 74 inspectors of his batch. But he was ranked 10th from among his batch mates when he was promoted to SP from Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and has now been made top-ranked among his batch mates.\\nBishnu Prasad Bhatta, who was the top-ranked inspector among the 74 from Kunwar’s batch, has now been ranked behind Kunwar while being promoted to SSP.\\nThe main objective for promoting him now as the top-ranked among his batch mates is to make him Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police first and then Inspector General of Police (IGP).\\nThere are currently three vacancies for DIG in the APF. There is no experience eligibility for DIG as in junior positions and Kunwar will directly become a candidate for DIG as Kandel, who is top-ranked among the newly promoted SSPs, would retire before becoming DIG due to age limit. Kunwar, who is ranked behind Kandel, would be an obvious claimant to IGP.\\nOne must pass staff college to become DIG of the APF. Kunwar has twice failed entrance examinations for staff college. But the APF leadership took a special decision to send him to the staff college of Nepal Army (NA) at Shivapuri for the course even though only the best few APF officers are sent to the Nepal Army staff college. It is, in this way, clearly apparent that he completed staff college due to political backing.\\nSP Kunwar’s promotion is directly connected to PM Deuba. The PM or his secretariat is at the center of how he has been illegitimately recommended for promotion, that too in a way that he is ranked top among his batch mates.\\nIt is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that the facts that have been uncovered about Kunwar now are false or revoke his unlawful recommendation. Deuba is guardian of all those serving the nation through NA, Nepal Police, APF and civil service in his capacity as the executive head of the country. The government led by him cannot mete out injustice to anyone.\\nDeuba’s responsibility as a PM elected by the people is toward the country and not his family. Democracy is a system of government of the people but all the citizens cannot go to the Singha Durbar and govern as that is not practically possible. The citizens, therefore, should govern through their representatives. The government or the leadership of government, in this manner, is the representative of citizens governing in their stead.\\nIt is the responsibility of those in the leadership to use that for the larger good of the citizens. It is arbitrary to shirk one’s responsibility and take any decision for the benefit of oneself or those close to oneself. Arbitrariness of the leadership is unacceptable and unpardonable in democracy.\\nThere is also another side to this.\\nIt is a legitimate expectation of every police officer to be top-ranked if she has performed well, has displayed integrity in behavior, excelled in work, and is more qualified than other contenders.\\n“The issue of promotion to IGP is not just an issue of the government’s pleasure but is also an issue of the rights and legitimate expectation of the candidates concerned,” reads a Supreme Court verdict curtailing the arbitrariness of the government in IGP appointment.\\nPM Deuba cannot trample on the legitimate expectations of any qualified police officer to promote his relative even now. Display of such arbitrariness by those in the government can harm the police organization in the long run. \\xa0\\nIf there is no environment where a new officer who has recently joined the police force can expect to become the IGP in the future because she believes she is the best police officer based on her conduct and capabilities, then why would anyone strive to become a good police officer? She will then try to curry favor with politicians and arrange money to offer to higher-ups. What will happen to the security of the country and the citizens then? Discrimination against public servants by every political party and leadership when in power will kill their dreams. That will, in turn, give rise to despair and increase malpractices in police and administration.\\nIt does not suit somebody like PM Deuba, who has even endured life in prison during such a long political career, to promote his relative causing injustice to others. More than that, this is blatantly immoral.\\nWe urge PM Deuba to immediately intervene and revoke the unlawful recommendation for promotion of his relative, protect the rights of other police officers, give them justice and save himself from yet another stain on his name.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe issue of grave controversy that Finance Minister Janardan Sharma has been mired is no longer limited to the Finance Ministry. The main responsibility for accountability definitely is Minister Sharma’s. But the buck stops with Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba as chairman of the Cabinet and Chairman of Sharma’s party Pushpa Kamal Dahal now that Sharma has run away from accountability.\\nIt is now PM Deuba’s responsibility to either prove that Finance Minister Sharma has not committed any offense or to immediately fire him and conduct an investigation. It is CPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Dahal’s responsibility to take initiative for that or at least support it as Sharma is minister from his party.\\nWe don’t know whether the grave allegations against Sharma that unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry premises in the midnight and corrected the tax rates in the budget to serve vested interests are true or not.\\nBut after the closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage episode we firmly believe that the issue should not be resolved without judicial or parliamentary investigation. Sharma can return to the ministry if he is proved innocent but he should be liable for legal and political punishment if his involvement in this grave crime is established.\\nThe issue for investigation is simple and clear. Had any unauthorized person entered the Finance Ministry in the midnight a day before the budget was presented in the federal parliament or not?\\nMinister Sharma has publicly claimed that no unauthorized persons entered the Finance Ministry at the time of finalizing the budget. We can give him benefit of doubt, if it can be given at all, only until the investigation on CCTV footage is completed. The investigation will find him innocent or guilty.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe irresponsible response that the Finance Ministry has given stating that the CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days in the right to information (RTI) request filed by a citizen seeking footage of the ministry at the alleged time of crime has made this issue graver.\\nThere are two sides of the CCTV footage episode. The first is the right of citizens for access to and surveillance of the works done by the state. The second is the responsibility of the Finance Ministry to keep the CCTV footage safe for at least three months. \\xa0\\nNepal has formulated law related to RTI. The spirit of that law is clear—the citizens have the right for surveillance of any work done by the state, any state organ or any official in that organ in a democratic country. They can seek information related to that in writing.\\nThe right of such surveillance of the politicians elected by the people and who are remunerated by the taxes paid by them is fundamental in a democratic system. It is the duty of every politician to be sensitive toward the right granted to the citizens by the law and comply with it. They cannot shirk from their responsibility.\\nThe RTI has been granted considering that politicians or any authorized person can take decision in a dark room against public interest for self-interest of them or others to ensure that they can make such decisions public and resist against those decisions.\\nThe citizens have been fulfilling their responsibilities toward democracy by electing politicians through their votes even in the most adverse conditions on the one hand. They have also been bearing the financial burden of keeping the state functioning by paying taxes despite the financial difficulties they face on the other. \\xa0\\nIt is, therefore, necessary to imbibe that the rights of citizens for surveillance of the state and politicians is inviolable. \\xa0\\nHow important the issue of a citizen seeking CCTV footage of the Finance Ministry automatically becomes clear once one accepts this basic tenet. It is legal and moral responsibility of the Finance Ministry leadership to provide the footage sought completing legal procedures. \\xa0The ministry has shirked from this responsibility by giving a written response that the ministry’s CCTV footage can be retained only for 13 days. \\xa0\\nThe Home Ministry’s guidelines about installation and operation of CCTV requires footage of CCTV cameras be kept safe for at least three months and adds that the district administration office concerned can investigate about the CCTV footage. The footage of May 28, therefore, should be kept safe at least until August 28.\\nThe gravity of allegations against Minister Sharma has increased further after the ministry’s response that it does not have the footage of the final night before the budget was presented in the House. He should not be exonerated of this episode without investigation which should start by immediately removing him as minister.\\nTechnological experts can retrieve the footage even if it has been lost. The wrong intentions would be automatically proved if the footage has been deleted in an irretrievable manner.\\nPM Deuba and Maoist Center Chairman Dahal do not have the luxury of ignoring this episode. Their support for Sharma, if not implication, will be clearly established if they do so.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDuring the monsoon season, almost every day, we wake up to some hazardous events such as landslides and floods and their devastating impact on people and society. Over the last decade Nepal experienced a number of major floods, landslides, windstorms, lightnings, public health-related and other monsoon hazards that caused loss of lives and livelihoods. This explains the diversity of hazards that Nepal faces and underscores the importance of more predictable and accountable disaster management.\\n2022 monsoon outlook and preparedness\\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA) estimates around two million people can be potentially affected by the monsoon hazards in 2022. Based on this caseload all three levels of government—federal, provincial, and local—together with humanitarian partners including the private sector have been engaged in preparedness and readiness activities to effectively respond to the potential monsoon disasters.\\nHowever, there are questions about effective implementation of such plans and policies. For example, when there is a disaster, provisions on such plans are overlooked. All the disaster management committees at local, district, provincial and federal levels convene and take some generic decisions. Often there is redundancy in the decisions and no follow-up. Coordination with other relief providers such as volunteer groups, private sector and civil society is ad-hoc. In the name of one-door policy, relief activities are held up. Often relief workers find it difficult to navigate the complexities and reach to the population in need of support.\\n“Funds and materials get allocated. There is never a serious shortfall, but the governance mechanism which is needed most during the time of crisis becomes more confusing. Whenever there is a disaster situation everybody in the bureaucracy and the political system, from ward member to the prime minister, gets engaged,” says Krishna Lamichhane, a Red Cross worker in Nawalparasi of Lumbini province. “They try to politically capitalize on the humanitarian situation and make a trip to the affected site. But real relief work takes a hit.” Lamichhane believes empowering front-line Red Cross network would improve delivery.\\nFront-line governance\\nAn accountable and predictable approach is required to timely protect lives and livelihoods from hazards and ensure effective disaster response. The Constitution of Nepal has entrusted the local bodies with an exclusive jurisdiction and responsibilities in disaster management. The local officials including elected ward officials, police, health workers and Red Cross are the first responders and manage the relief efforts in the critical early hours of response.\\nGiven their detailed knowledge of the community, the local bodies are best able to identify hazards, assess vulnerabilities and design appropriate policies to reduce and manage risks. Local officials are well positioned to spearhead disaster preparedness planning. Moreover, many practical local measures can be implemented at the local level to ensure disasters are managed locally as much as possible and nationalized only when it is necessary.\\nAlthough local bodies bear primary functional responsibility for disaster management, local capacity particularly in disaster response is weak. The local bodies lack own search and rescue workers and technical expertise. The district authorities, which are federal government entities, maintain the capability in search and rescue, and support the local bodies. Post-disaster analyses essentially reveal that local disaster management capacities are weak and underfunded.\\nIn addition to the technical capabilities, local decision-making process has to be effective and efficient. “The governance mechanism has to be facilitating and coordinating in responding to disasters or other problems in the society,” says Deputy Mayor of Rajapur Municipality in Bardiya Mankala Kumari Chaudhary. She emphasizes that necessary guidelines, protocols and standards have to be developed and updated by the government. To have predictability in governance, there must be accountability of the elected officials and the institutions and partnership with wide range of actors in the society.\\nTransforming traditional governance to anticipatory approaches\\nGiven the unpredictability in hazards, the country needs to move away from the traditional form of reactive approach to more anticipatory approaches. The anticipatory approaches are the ability to harness the collective intelligence and wisdom of collaborating with organizations and citizens. According to Leon Fuerth (2009), anticipatory governance is “a system of institutions, rules and norms that provide a way to use foresight for the purpose of reducing risk and to increase capacity to respond to events at early rather than later states of their development.”\\nBetter disaster preparedness and anticipatory governance could be achieved by emphasizing readiness for all types of hazards and involving multiple dimensions including mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery.\\nNepal has started practicing anticipatory governance approach in disaster management one way or the other. For instance, the government, security forces and other partners annually organize simulation and drill exercises before the onset of monsoon season. These exercises are important in diagnosing shortfall in disaster response plan and mechanisms and help in fostering strong working relationships among the responders.\\nThe Department of Hydrology and Meteorology has been providing three-day and the long-range forecasts. Based on these weather forecasts, authorities disseminate early warning messages to the communities. The local governments and relief organizations are able to implement some preventive and mitigative measures before there is a flood.\\nAlso, there is an ongoing discourse on strict implementation of land use policy to reduce the impacts of hazards. The land use regulations that prohibit construction on risky land such as flood plains contribute to averting the disaster. “Traditionally, the community and its leaders have set norms and rules on the land use and zoning of land. The land was classified based on its nature and topography. But these days with boom in real estate every piece of land, even dangerously sloping land, is being bulldozed,” says Khagendra Pant, local high school teacher in Bhajani, Kailali.\\nThe NDRRMA is leading scenario-based preparedness which involves analyzing underlying risk and vulnerabilities to different hazards and developing caseloads. The authority asks different ministries, departments and partners to prepare a plan based on those scenarios and caseloads. It also involves measuring a community’s capability to respond effectively—such as planning for the evacuation sites for people living with disability. The NDRRMA has embraced the principles of risk management in its disaster preparedness and response approach. Risk-based emergency planning involves assessment of the risk a community is likely to face, and estimation of probable impacts associated with these risks over a specific period. The process of identifying, analyzing and prioritizing risk is increasingly regarded as the optimal means to allocate scarce emergency management resources.\\nCall to action\\nThe underlying risk posed by the climate change and unpredictability in the hazard patterns warrant anticipatory governance to take preventative and mitigating approaches in saving lives and livelihood. It’s high time we made disaster response and recovery work more predictable, accountable, and responsive. With these unprecedented challenges, the policy development requires speed. Some policies must be developed and updated within a short period of time. The scope of the policy work and problem of the communities need to be adequately diagnosed. Additionally, resources from each level of government should be brought to the table and inter-governmental collaboration should be forged. This is how a system that is able to respond to the unexpected crises arising from climate change can be built.\\nTo make disaster response anticipatory, a multi-hazard early warning system has to be put in place. A system that is able to cope with any foreseen and unforeseen crisis requires updating and activating the communication networks across provinces, districts, local bodies and practitioners.\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe politics is heated in the past few days due to the State Partnership Program (SPP) of America. Facts and lies alike regarding the SPP have come to the fore.\\nForeign Minister Narayan Khadka’s comments about the SPP in the House, the US Embassy’s briefing to journalists, the statement issued by the Nepal Army (NA) and speeches by politicians in accordance with their interests have created confusions instead of clarifying about SPP.\\nThe US Embassy invited journalists and stated that no draft of SPP agreement has been submitted to the Government of Nepal. It also claimed that Nepal had applied to participate in SPP in 2015 and 2017, and the application was approved in 2019.\\nThe then Nepal Army (NA) Chief Rajendra Chhetri had applied for partnership on both the occasions and the NA had copied both the applications to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal, according to the US Embassy.\\nThe NA issued a statement Wednesday evening claiming that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP. \"The Nepal Army has not signed any agreement or understanding about the SPP with the US Army or government, and there is no process toward signing such agreement,\" the NA statement says. \"The Nepal Army is always clear about the objective fact about not doing military partnership in the future with anyone in a way that can adversely affect the non-aligned foreign policy adopted by Nepal and Nepal\\'s special geopolitical location and strategic sensitivities.\"\\nThe NA statement has mentioned that no agreement or understanding has been signed about the SPP but it has not spoken about the claims of the US Embassy that it had first applied for participation in 2015 and then again in 2017.\\nNo agreement needs to be signed to participate in the SPP going by what the US Embassy says. Interested countries apply for participation and America accepts the application.\\nThe Government of Nepal should now inform the House about all the facts related to SPP issuing a white paper. The issue will continue to create suspicions otherwise. It will become an issue for political one-upmanship and allegations and counter-allegations.\\nThe NA must have copies of the applications submitted by the then NA Chief Chhetri in 2015 and 2017. The US Embassy’s claims that both the applications were also copied to the Defense Ministry and the Foreign Ministry of Nepal hint that the two ministries also have copies of the applications. The letter that Chhetri had sent in 2015 when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister (PM) has been made public Thursday.\\nBut the letter said to have been sent in 2017 has yet to be made public and what exactly was written in that letter has yet to be known. America has said that it allowed Nepal to join the SPP in 2019 on the basis of these two applications.\\nThe Government of Nepal should seek answers from America if the intention of those two letters was not to become part of the SPP and ask for removal of Nepal’s name from its website.\\nThe government and the NA cannot be irresponsible and just say that they have not signed any agreement when America has listed Nepal as a member country of the SPP.\\nWhat may actually have happened is the NA asked for help from the US Army in disaster management after the Gorkha Earthquake in 2015. It may have applied for the SPP after the US Army likely responded that such assistance can be provided after receiving application for the SPP. The NA may again have applied in 2017 for similar assistance.\\nWe don’t believe that the NA or the government led by any politician will knowingly decide to enter a long-term military partnership with America. Nobody seems to be in a state to definitively say about all the aspects related to the SPP today. Politicians, be those inside the government or in the opposition, seem more confused. They, however, are resorting to allegations and counter-allegations against each other even in this confusion. They are spending the time they should invest on understanding the issue and unearth the facts in making allegations.\\nCPN-UML—which has been the loudest in raising questions about the SPP both inside the House and outside to try to show that it is the only nationalist party, and create doubts about patriotism of others—is in an awkward position after it has been revealed that the first application for participation in the SPP was sent when the party led the government.\\nCPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal seems to be in haste to allege that Oli made the deal as he led the government when America accepted Nepal’s application in 2019.\\nThis nature of our politicians to resort to inflammatory allegations and counter-allegations on sensitive national issues instead of displaying appropriate gravity and sensitivity is not new. The allegations that politicians knowingly or unknowingly have levelled against each other since 1951 about nationalism and foreign policy have made Nepal weak in the eyes of foreigners the most. Leaders and parties are unfortunately repeating the same irresponsibility and rhetoric even on the issue of SPP.\\nWe believe the politicians who try to depict only themselves as nationalists and always attack on patriotism and integrity of others, and publicly slander others calling them brokers are fake nationalists.\\nThe need of the hour is to find out truth and facts about the SPP, make them public and conclude the issue forging national unity. The SPP is not merely a program for the US Army to assist other countries in issues including disaster management as claimed by the US Embassy and Foreign Minister Khadka in the House. Those things are also part of the SPP but the SPP is more than that.\\nAn article about the main objectives of the SPP by a former chief of the American National Guard that cooperates with armies of different countries clarifies how broad the SPP’s scope is and what its main objectives are.\\nThis definitely does not mean that the NA should not establish any relations with the US Army. The NA has relations with the armies of India, China, US and other countries for years. The NA participates in joint exercises with the Indian and Chinese armies every year. It also holds joint drills with the US Army.\\nThe US Army has been providing training to the NA on disaster management, search and rescue, counter-terrorism and other areas. NA officials go to American war colleges and other organizations for studies and training on a regular basis. This practice had been continuing even before Nepal applied for the SPP.\\nWhat necessitated Nepal’s application for the SPP in recent years? How can we be assured that this application incorporates only these areas of cooperation between the NA and the US Army? Who will give the assurance?\\nNepal cannot, and must not, enter the wide spectrum of partnership between the two armies under the SPP. On the one hand, we have our geopolitical sensitivity, and we have our constitutional commitment and responsibility toward non-aligned foreign policy on the other. If we follow the simple formula of aligning with all world powers on matters of economy and development while remaining non-aligned on strategic matters, it will not only help us achieve economic gains but also protect us from strategic tensions and risks.\\nAre the common people expecting too much from the political parties if they want all political parties to consign their past invectives against each other to history and stand together. If not, let us first make public all the facts related to the SPP through a white paper in the sovereign parliament. After that, let all the major political parties reach an agreement on how to resolve the issue of SPP.\\nLet the series of abusing and doubting each other on the issue of nationalism and foreign policy be stopped. Let us make Nepal a mature country that does not harm anyone, strongly stand for her interests, participates with everyone economically but remain strategically non-aligned in the eyes of our neighbors and friendly countries.\\nAre the politicians ready for that?\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe committee formed by the government to invstigate the allegations made against Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) Governor Maha Prasad Adhikari reminds of kangaroo courts that autocrats across the world form to persecute their opponents and rivals.\\nFinance Minister Janardan Sharma has got Adhikari suspended by influencing Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba due to his ego and prejudice, and got a committee formed through the Cabinet to investigate Adhikari.\\nSharma has not been able to publicly defend suspension of governor of an autonomous body like the NRB. Governors are not generally suspended unless they show serious moral depravity or knowingly harm the country. They must never be suspended on the basis of policy differences.\\xa0\\nThe NRB can adopt a policy that differs from that of the government based on the needs of the economy. Political parties can disrupt the country's economy in accordance to their short-term interests or political needs. The NRB has been given autonomy precisely to ensure that it can pay attention to stability of the economy through monetary policy to stop that. \\xa0\\nGovernor Adhikari had implemented the NRB policies in coordination with the government policies even in practice. The NRB and the government coordinate their policies at normal times and the finance secretary is kept in the NRB board for that purpose.\\nAdhikari has not acted to harm the economy defying the government or flouting government's instructions. He instead intervened and prevented hike in interest rate for a long time to fulfill the finance minister's wish to increase loan investment by banks keeping a low interest rate, and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 raise economic activities and the economic growth rate. That is seen to have increased flow of cheap money into the economy, increased import and put pressure on foreign currency reserves now.\\nSome policies adopted with good intention can prove to be wrong in the long run and put pressure on the economy. No economy would suffer crisis if all the policies were proved right and accurate prediction of a crisis were possible. There is no country in the world that has never suffered an economic crisis. All the state organs, therefore, should have come together to find a solution to the problem currently facing our economy without blaming anyone.\\nFinance Minister Sharma instead has alleged Adhikari of not cooperating with the government, harming the economy, leaking important economic information among others to avenge on an absolutely different issue.\\nIt is not hidden from anyone that Sharma has attacked Adhikari after revelations that he took initiative to release the money transferred in the name of Prithvi Bahadur Shah from America that the NRB has frozen after America requested the central bank to investigate and return the amount back to America suspecting that it may have arrived through money laundering or fraud. To take an initiative to release the amount that has been red-flagged by America was a serious mistake on part of the finance minister.\\nThat he got the governor suspended suspecting that Adhikari leaked the information and a committee formed including persons close to him to investigate that shows that he is intent on practicing vigilante justice.\\nThe kind of persons included in the 'kangaroo committee' formed on initiative of Sharma gives away what his intentions are. The committee that Sharma has got constituted through the Cabinet including a former justice who is his relative and two party cadres has ended the possibility of fair investigation of allegations made against the governor and chances for justice.\\nConstitution of such 'kangaroo committee' has made mockery of justice. Responsibility for that now lies not just with Sharma but Chairman of the Cabinet that formed the 'kangaroo committee' and his party Nepali Congerss (NC). Neither PM Deuba nor NC can now run away from that.\\nPractising 'kangaroo court' and vigilante justice is not new for the Maoists that had practiced so during the armed insurgency. But how could NC agree for that? It should declare whether any citizen has the right for fair investigation of allegations made against her in a liberal and democratic society it has promised to the people. Whether that is a fundamental right for any citizen in today's Nepal or not?\\xa0 If yes, why is that right of Governor Adhikari denied? How could a Cabinet meeting attended by PM Deuba form such a 'kangaroo committee' on whims of Minister Sharma? On what basis the Deuba Cabinet endorsed such a decision that attacks the autonomy granted to the NRB and its governor by the law?\\nThese questions raised against PM Deuba and NC led by him are not simple. This Cabinet decision to form the 'kangaroo committee' attacks the very trust that the people have on NC for\\xa0 the kind of values and norms it swears allegiance to.\\nThe only way to correct the mistake now is to revoke the 'kangaroo committee' and withdraw the suspension of Governor Adhikari.\\xa0\\nNC should mull whether the public trust on it for its values and norms is important or transient interests of ruling coalition and defnse of the finance minister's whims are?\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nSurgery is considered as one of the very rewarding disciplines providing good amount of personal and professional job satisfaction. Unfortunately, it is also considered as one of the most stressful professions. Both during the period of surgical training as well as clinical practice, people are prone to developing burnout due to excessive stress. Predisposing factors could be multiple. Multiple studies published overseas have demonstrated that the burnout rate among the surgical trainees and practicing surgeons is very high in comparison to other specialties.\\nWhy surgeons are prone to stress?\\nIn surgical specialties, the job demands extreme amount of hard work, both mentally and physically. Besides this, the working hours are extra-long and just not limited to fixed schedules, and the on-call duties are extremely tiring and long. Most of the times the surgeons are dealing with life-and-death situations and one small error either in judgment or skill can prove fatal. At some busy centers the surgeons are overloaded with patients too. Moreover, the training in surgical specialties is extremely prolonged and even after completing their general and specialty trainings they further need supervised working environment to gain good amount of exposure and develop enough confidence. Each individual surgeon can work independently only after that. These prolonged period of training leads to disbalance in their professional and personal life. Similarly, the compulsion to excel both in academics and surgical practice as well as trying to balance with economical aspects are important factors leading to development of burnout among surgeons. Failure to achieve balance in academic, clinical practice and personal life is again the most important factor for the development of stress among surgeons. Sometimes the pressure on the surgeons by the administration to increase performance also adds up the stress among the surgeons who are already prone to stress because of various predisposing factors. Increasing possibility of dealing with litigations in surgical practice is also one of the strongest factors for surgeons to experience stress and develop burnouts.\\nWhat is the prevalence of stress among surgeons?\\nApart from some anecdotal reports and expert viewpoints, there has been no published study on this subject matter in Nepal till date. This is one of the very important areas to be researched in Nepal as surgical training and clinical practice in surgical specialties are increasingly becoming very challenging and competitive, and also invite risk of litigations. The number of surgeons in the country has also significantly increased. One US study published in “Surgery” journal in 2001, University of Michigan-Ann Arbor, did a survey on 582 surgeons. Overall, 32% surgeons showed high levels of emotional exhaustion, 13% depersonalization and 4% showed low sense of personal accomplishment. Young surgeons were found to be more vulnerable to suffering stress. Similarly, another Australian study published in ANZ journal of Surgery in 2007 evaluated 126 Surgeons. They found that the surgeons were suffering high level of burnout than the general population. Around 48% of the surgeons surveyed reported high burnout levels. Besides these published reports, there are plenty of other\\xa0overseas publications supporting the fact that the surgeons are very prone to developing burnout and suffering from stress. It has also been found that the experienced surgeons are more likely to have higher management ability as compared to those younger ones and with fewer years of experience.\\nWhat is the effect of stress among surgeons?\\nBurnout and stress can spill over to personal and professional life. Burnouts can lead to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and low personal accomplishment. Besides this, stress can be significant contributor to poor health of a surgeon. Anxiety and depression can both be a reason for serious health issues among very stressed and burnt out surgeons. Suffering from broken relationships to drug and alcohol dependence can be a serious issue and at extreme situations they are also prone to suicidal tendencies in lack of timely intervention. Stress and burnout lead to imbalance between personal and professional life which further adds to the suffering of already stressed surgeons and this vicious cycle can continue. Job performance further deteriorates in those surgeons already under stress. This can in fact affect the outcome of the patients being treated. Thus, stress and burnouts have serious consequences which are not just limited to the surgeon suffering from it but also can affect the patient being treated and overall health services of a center.\\nHow can we prevent that?\\nDespite the high prevalence of stress and burnout among surgeons, there are still ways to reduce it\\xa0although it can’t be completely avoided. There is no best way to prevent it because it needs to be individualized based on every individual’s working condition, environment, job responsibilities and personalities besides many other factors to be considered. There are plenty of ways described in various published literatures to reduce and prevent stress among surgeons and surgical trainees which could in fact be applied to any other specialty too. The past experience of handling the stressful situation can be adopted even during surgical training periods and in clinical practice too. Identifying priorities both in personal and professional life is a must. One should understand and know one's limits as to what extent to be devoted to surgery. It may not be very applicable during training but definitely an important issue to be considered while practicing as a professional surgeon. Not everyone can do everything and one should understand one's limits and potential. Getting inspired from others is definitely rewarding but comparing oneself to others can unnecessarily increase the stress. Trying to balance between clinical, academic and personal life which also includes the financial aspects is a must. Running after one single aspect is definitely going to be non-rewarding and there is possibility of developing stressful situation due to self-understood reasons. Working in a team, sharing responsibilities and asking for help whenever required are of utmost importance in preventing stress and burnout among surgeons. A very supporting family can definitely help dealing with stressful situations. However, not everyone could be lucky enough to have a very understanding family or a colleague. Reading articles, publications and books on stress management can also help significantly.\\xa0 For those having a concerning level of stress and burnouts participation in formal stress management training programs and also getting timely medical interventions can help. From the administrative perspective, imposing scientifically correct working hours and workloads both on trainees and practicing surgeons can help avoid unnecessary stress and decrease burnouts among these vulnerable population.\\nIn conclusion, surgery is a very rewarding yet stressful discipline due to various reasons and surgeons both as trainees and practicing surgeons are prone to developing burnout and suffering stress. This can have various consequences not just limited to individual but also affecting the whole system. Thus, efforts should be made at the individual level to the level of administrators and stakeholders to prevent and reduce the prevalence of stress and burnout among surgical trainees and practicing surgeons which then will help in creating a safe working environment for service providers as well as increasing the patient safety.\\n(The author is liver and gastro surgeon and profesor at the TUTH)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe context\\nPublic policy in general is conceptual roadmap for government to address specific public concerns and/or deliver specific constitutional mandates and it provides framework for ensuring legal, institutional, procedural, and resources (both human and financial) required to deliver the commitments of the particular public policy. Effectiveness of Nepal’s public polices has to be examined within this definitional framework.\\nFor the past two years, I am heavily engaged in reviewing public polices, comparing different existing public polices and reviewing several new draft polices prepared by different ministries and government agencies. This process helped to understand how they are formulated, why they are formulated in that particular way, how effective they are implemented and why they fail. In this article I am reflecting on why public polices often fail in Nepal.\\nReasons of public policies’ failure \\nI found the following major reasons of ineffectiveness or even failure of public polices in Nepal:\\n\\nWeakness in the policy formulation process: Lack of proper need assessment and weak prioritization, no sincere risk and opportunities assessment, not even proper definition of policy, no proper consultation with key stakeholders to collect their concerns and voices resulting in lack of ownership, very top-down process leading to few formal activities to meet the legal/procedural requirement, time pressure for quick delivery of policy, etc. Right policy formulation process often leads to higher possibility for effective implementation and vice versa. Hence, one of the major reasons of failure of public policy is lack of adopting right process.\\n\\n\\nInconsistencies in content of policy formulation: Once there is lack of proper need identification, analysis and prioritization, appropriate risk assessment, lack of conceptual clarity in absence of definition, there is always possibility of inconsistencies and flaws/vagueness in the content. Because of lack of conceptual clarity, the whole document as well as individual policy statement is called policy. Many times the logical sequencing between a) policy statement, b) strategies and c) implementing guidelines are weak or missing, very vague statements with similar meaning are presented in policy statements, strategies and implementing guidelines.\\n\\n\\nInstitutional mechanism: In most of the polices, there is no clear responsibilities of responsible institutions outlined and agreed, thereby creating confusion and lack of ownership in implementation. Most of the polices require engagement of several inter-ministerial institutions. Policies brought by one ministry with the responsibilities of implementation on another ministry is one of the main reasons for dysfunction.\\n\\n\\nLegal provisions: Several policy provisions demand legal back up for successful implementation. But most of the polices are prepared without proper assessment of legal situation (does any existing law inhibit implementation, is new law required to implement the policy etc.). Hence, once policy is formulated, many existing laws prohibit (e.g., forest law or park and people law) implementation or new laws are required. This situation must be assessed while making policy and clear legal provisions required to implement specific policy must be outlined in the policy. Further, unlike laws, there is no provision of punishment to concerned officials if he or she fails to implement particular policy resulting in impunity for lack of implementation.\\n\\n\\nCoordination: Lack of inter-ministerial and inter-agency coordination is another big barrier to implementing policy effectively, as scope of most of the policies (e.g., agriculture policy, urban development policy, water, sanitation and hygiene policy, etc.) goes beyond the remit of single ministry (eg, agriculture, irrigation, industries, trade and supply, finance, foreign affairs, home affairs ministries are related with agriculture policy). Hence, if proper consultation with concerned ministers at the beginning of policy formulation is not done and clear commitment not ensured, policy will not work.\\n\\n\\nResources provisions: Many policies at the time of formulation do not assess the tentative financial and human resources requirements. Without proper projection of resources required for implementing the policy, possibility of its failure is high.\\nTime required for public policy formulation: Often Nepal’s public policies are formulated in a very short time (few weeks to hardly a few months) leaving aside important public consultation process because of pressure from minsters leading ultimately to lack of public ownership and failure. Depending on the gravity of topic, time span for a policy formulation process requires nine months and up to 10 years (for policies’ that are directly related with a large number of people, such as agriculture/health and sanitation, etc.).\\n\\n\\nMonitoring and evaluation: Most of the policies mention about monitoring and evaluation but there are no indicators (what to monitor/evaluate), no time frame (when to do), and assigning of responsibility. So, it remains simply a jargon statement.\\n\\n\\nSupplementary elaborations and documents: Complex polices require supplementary documents (strategies, guidelines, procedures etc.) that are not indicated in the policies but affect policy implementation.\\n\\nWay ahead\\nExisting practice of policy formulation must be changed if we want to see public policy implemented. In this context, Policy Research Institute (PRI) has developed two guidelines related to public polices: one related to formulation of public polices and another related to reviewing public policies, to assist government ministries. Very brief synopsis of public policy formulation cycle is presented below:\\nPublic Policy Formulation to follow the ‘Public Policy Formation Cycle’ that starts with\\n\\nidentification and analysis of policy issues,\\nprioritization of policy issues,\\npreliminary draft as per the standard format (developed by Policy Research Institute),\\ncall for the public to give feedback and public dialogue over the preliminary draft,\\nrevision of the preliminary draft based on the public feedback,\\nreview of the revised draft by team of experts and adaptation of draft,\\ncirculation at the public level for their comments and feedback on the draft (sending to all key stakeholders and requesting for their feedback and organization of a series of feedback meetings with stakeholders),\\nrevision of the draft policy for finalization,\\nsubmission of the draft to cabinet committee for approval,\\npolicy implementation,\\npolicy evaluation (after 5 years of implementation) and decision of continuity, revision or need for new policy.\\n\\nCompletion of this process generally requires about nine months and in case of policies dealing with the concerns of large population such as health policy, agriculture policy, drinking water and sanitation policies and education policies years of continuous consultation and public debate is required. Now Nepal needs to change the present practice of policy formulation in terms of process, content, expected outcomes.\\n(The author is currently serving as executive chairperson of the Policy Research Institute, a government think tank)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe country is currently polarized over the US$ 500 million grant the American government is providing through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC). The MCC Compact signed between Nepal and America four years ago have yet to come into implementation in lack of ratification by the House.\\nThe American government has already said that the amount will be given to another country if the MCC Compact is not ratified by the House by February end. The act of picking controversy over a grant agreement with a friendly nation four years after signing the agreement shows how pathetic and irresponsible our diplomacy is. Such an important issue that needs to be discussed in the House has not even been taken to the House.\\nThe dispute, therefore, has reached the streets and even the dining table of the people. The politicians stayed mere spectators instead of becoming serious about such an important issues related to the country's future. \\xa0This further compounded matters. The MCC Compact should be tabled in the House without any delay and lawmakers should take a decision using their wisdom.\\nThe then prime minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli had registered the MCC for discussion in the House when he led the CPN government. But the then speaker Krishna Bahadur Mahara did not allow discussion in the House on instruction of Pushpa Kamal Dahal who was chairman of ruling CPN along with Oli.\\nAgni Sapkota, who shares Maoist background with Mahara, also did not hold discussion amidst power struggle inside CPN after he became speaker. He did not just deny the government the right to take any bill or proposal of its choice to the House but also obstructed exercise of the sovereign right of the lawmakers elected by the people to hold discussion on those issues. This is unpardonable on the part of Sapkota in capacity of speaker. Speaker Sapkota should now take the MCC Compact for discussion without any excuse and delay. Whether to end the House obstruction for discussion or not is up to CPN-UML. He cannot shirk his responsibility pointing at UML.\\nMany political leaders have been irresponsible on the issue of MCC. CPN (Maoist Center) Chair Dahal has been the most irresponsible among the top leaders. He generally has a dual position on any issue. He has this habit of saying one thing one day and exactly the opposite the next day on any issue irrespective of gravity of the issue. He unfortunately swung like a pendulum even on the issue of MCC and bilateral relation with America.\\nHe made a sensitive issue like MCC a tool for his power struggle inside the party in the beginning. He had said the MCC Compact will be ratified by the House in Kantipur Conclave a few years back. But he first used Mahara and then Sapkota, and stopped MCC's entry in the House as his relation with Oli soured.\\nNepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba had asked Dahal about the MCC Compact before forging the alliance to unseat Oli from pemiership. Deuba actually wanted to form the coalition government only after getting the MCC Compact ratified. Dahal had promised his party's support to pass the MCC Compact after forming the coalition government. But Dahal started to make conflicting remarks about MCC once the new government was formed. He claimed that he is not in favor of passing it inside his party even as he swore his support for the agreement with American officials. He told Deuba that he needs more time to convince comrades inside his party.\\nDahal penned a joint letter to the MCC on September 29, 2021 along with PM Deuba after American officials said they will take back the amount if it is not endorsed by the House, and sought four-five months to create a favorable environment for MCC inside his party and in the country. He also promised to get the MCC Compact ratified in his official meetings with American officials in the intervening period. He did not raise the issue of amending the agreement in the joint letter sent to the MCC or during the multiple meetings with American officials. But he continued to tell leaders inside his party that the MCC Compact cannot be passed without amendment. So much so that he got the party's stance endorsed by the recent general convention.\\xa0\\nHow can a top leader of a major party and a former PM act so irresponsibily? The country has suffered a huge loss due to his dual character. But he himself and his party has suffered an even greater loss due to that. Dahal continued to sell the dream of rebellion and state capture to the rank and file even after he gave up the armed rebellion and joined peaceful politics. He mentally sailed the two boats of peace and rebellion.\\nHe and his party would have been in a far better position in Nepali politics now had he focused on transforming his party for peaceful politics and seeking resolution to the political, social and economic issues facing the country through the House right from the beginning. He has not even imagined the harm the dual nature he is showing now on the issue of MCC has incurred for him. He will face the consequences if he does not mend his ways.\\nThe main opposition UML has also resorted to politicking on the issue of MCC in recent times. UML has put the party's interests above that of the country's even \\xa0though it may not be as shameless as Dahal's. As the issue of MCC gets trickier, there is risk of conflict of powerful countries intensifying inside Nepal and the country getting in a geopolitical tangle. That is not an issue of concern for just one party.\\nIf all the parties come together, we cannot just evade the potential geopolitical mess but also have the opportunity of moving forward with a foreign policy based on a balanced relations with all the powerful countries. The country currently needs cognizance and cooperation from all the parties. But UML is busy counting its political gains and losses.\\nSetopati has always been clear on the issue of ratifying the MCC Compact. America definitely may have its strategic interest in the MCC just as China may have in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI|) and India in any other development project. But Nepal has not done any strategic deal in the MCC Compact it has signed. We will be bound only by the MCC Compact in the coming days. The issues mentioned in the MCC Compact are purely related only to development projects—construction of transmission lines essential for Nepal, and repair and maintenance of the roads.\\nThere are many reasons for the issues in the agreement being dragged into controversy. Many do not know anything about this agreement. They have not even read the agreement but are opposing it on the basis of hearsay. Some are opposing in lack of understanding about how international treaties and agreements are drafted and their meaning. Some are not familiar about the language used in deals about development projects and are opposing it. Still others are opposing by misinterpreting the meaning of English language used in the agreement. And some are opposing it due to their prejudice.\\nThe MCC Office has already sent written response to all the questions raised about the MCC. The MCC Compact itself has a provision allowing both Nepal and America to unilaterally revoke the deal giving a 30-day notice if they have any grievances regarding implementation of the Compact. We will always reserve the rights to walk away from the agreement giving a 30-day notice if Nepal does not agree with anything or America puts pressure to that regard after the MCC Compact comes into implementation. We must, therefore, get the MCC Compact ratified through the House and take it into implementation without any apprehension. \\xa0\\nSetopati is also clear about the issue of geopoliitcs. Nepal will have to maintain cordial and close relation with all the neighboring and powerful countries, and use that to our benefits.\\nWe should not oppose any country for the sake of another, and not allow any to interfere in the relation with another. India wanted Nepal to not sign the BRI and had even quietly lobbied for that. We had said we should sign the BRI with China even then. We are also clear that we should build better relation with the northern neighbor. We should not allow India or America to interfere in our relation with China just like we should not allow China to covertly or overtly interfere in our relation with India or America. \\xa0\\nOnly that will provide an opportunity for us to maintain close relation with all the powerful countries and reap benefits from that. Nepal will become a playground for powerful countries if Nepal supports or opposes any country for the sake of another. That will spell trouble for us in the long run.\\xa0\\nThe lawmakers, therefore, should think seriously about the issue and take a decision based on their wisdom. The people have elected lawmakers prescisely to discuss and decide about such important and tricky issues. They should fulfill that responsibility handed over by the electorate.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nNepali politics has suddenly become heated in the middle of the winter on the issue of when to hold parliamentary and local elections. Different positions of the parties have been made public while the Constitution and election laws are also being interpreted differently.\\nParties are currently making different interpretations of Article 225 of the Constitution and clause 3 of the Local Election Act.\\nArticle 225 states that the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly will be five years, and election for the next rural assembly and municipal assembly should be held within six months of end of that term.\\nClause 3 of the Local Election Act, on the other hand, states that members will be elected two months before the term of rural assembly and municipal assembly expires.\\nCPN (Maoist Center) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal has argued that local election can be held in November-December pointing that the Constitution prevails if provision of other laws contradict the Constituion.\\nSome legal experts point that the Constitution and the election act talk about rural assembly and municipal assembly and not rural municipality and municipality.\\nElection of 753 rural and municipal assemblies can be, and have been, held on separate days depending on the choice and convenience of elected local representatives. The experts point that there would have been no dispute now if the act had mentioned that election should be held two months before the term of member of rural municipality and municipal expires. \\xa0\\nNo matter how the parties interpret these provisions now, we all know that the parties were careful about two things at the time of promulgating the Constitution.\\nOne is the term of local bodies will be five years and the local bodies will not be left without leadership in lack of election due to the bitter experience of local bodies remaining without elected people's representatives for around two decades. The leaders were as careful about local bodies not remaning without leadership as they were about the House not being dissolved before completing its five-year term.\\nAnother is ruling parties should not unilaterally change election date, and basic laws like election laws, laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies because they are directly related to the institution and system of democracy. If there is no discussion and consensus among the parties represented in the House about such issues, that derails the system and institution itself.\\nWe had, therefore, strongly protested when KP Sharma Oli unilaterally amended the laws about splitting political parties and appointment at constitutional bodies when he was prime minister (PM) to serve his narrow interest.\\nThe ruling coalition seems to be trying to amend election laws and change election date due to similar self-interests. The ruling coalition has its own onterests in first holding the federal election in April-May and the local election in November-December.\\nThe ruling coalition cannot ally in all 753 local bodies as cadres of Nepali Congress (NC) will not allow that. CPN (Unified Socialist) and even Maoist Center will struggle to win local bodies if the parties in the coalition ally.\\nThe ruling alliance will be under huge psychological pressure if the two communist parties fare poorly in the local election. NC does not want the two parties to seem weak before the general election. If the two parties seem weaker, that will benefit CPN-UML and hurt NC's prospects in the general election.\\nThe ruling alliance may also feel that vacancy in the local bodies will benefit the coalition as UML had won at more places than other parties in the last local election.\\nSher Bahadur Deuba has been accused of keeping the local bodies without elected leadership for two decades in the past. PM Deuba should not lead the act of keeping local bodies without elected leadership even this time.\\nThere are many things that need to be reformed in the election process. Holding election of all three levels of government together will not just save the state's coffers in election expenditure but also mean that decisions about development projects, transfer and promotion of staffers and other issues need not be stopped repeatedly due to the election code of conduct that comes into effect before the election.\\nThere are many such issues that the parties represented in the parliament have to sit together and agree for electoral reform to make our democracy more \\xa0polished. There will definitely be a solution if the parties sit together and agree to hold the three elections together either in April-May or November-December.\\nBut the ruling coalition should not unilaterally amend election laws or push back the election date if the parties to fail to agree on these issues. There should be local election in April-May and provincial and federal elections in November-December if there is no consensus. \\xa0\\nThe government should not again invite political \\xa0mayhem by deciding otherwise.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nIndustry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nIt appears that the current generation of loving couples getting married in Nepal in an urban context are enchanted and enthralled by the idea of a soulmate. Hence, the idea of someone being your soulmate keeps trending on different social networking sites as an ideal version of being in love together. Although the current generation of loving couples has an idealized image of a soulmate, in reality, for many people, the idea of finding and living with a social mate remains limited to mere appearances—just a tagline posted along with a visual representation of togetherness shared on different social networking sites.\\nOur everyday idea about the soulmate falls short of its ideals because we\\xa0rely on imitations of plastic images of love trending in different mediums of pop culture, compare and contrast our possible loving partners with superficial expressions of other loving couples, and also follow the suggestions and guidelines of other people to identify and determine our soulmate.\\xa0Similarly, we have misguided expectations about a soulmate as someone who brings a sense of security and feelings of comfort, along with the promise of everlasting love, into our lives.\\nBesides, our criteria for\\xa0falling in love with another person are such that we give more preference and priority to what the person has, like a\\xa0bank balance, a green card,\\xa0a dependent visa,\\xa0social status, and a handsome or beautiful face, than to who he or she is as a person with inner human qualities such as honesty, trustworthiness, understanding, commitment, and caring.\\nMany people miss their soulmates because they are so out of touch with their inner lives as individuals that they remain unaware of the person who is carrying the beats of her heart inside his own.\\xa0Soulmates get married because they are for each other, not for any other reason.\\nMore importantly, without anything as such to connect with, enrich, and nourish a loving relationship together from within, being in love without a soulmate becomes utterly boring, shallow, lost in appearances, and meaningless. Being in love without a soulmate is a tedious struggle of finding one temporary delight after another in the outer world to justify and demonstrate the shallow and soulless love people have for each other.\\nThe idea of each of us having a soulmate was first put forth by Greek philosopher\\xa0Plato, who in his seminal work Symposium stated that each of us has another half of our own soul in another physical body; hence, as human beings, we have this inner, irresistible\\xa0yearning\\xa0for that interconnection with another being that\\xa0would make us feel undivided and complete, and as long as soulmates remain separated, there will always be an inner sense of lack, as if things are missing out, out of touch, shallow, and incomplete.\\nSimilarly, in Hindu religious tradition, we have the\\xa0divine\\xa0union between Goddess Parvati and\\xa0Lord Shiva\\xa0as Shiva and Shakti expressed in a singular being, Ardhanarishwar; this\\xa0mythological narrative is a symbolic representation of reunion between soulmates. Indeed, the struggles and sacrifices of Devi Parvati to belong with Lord Shiva indicate that\\xa0when it comes to a spiritual journey to find a soulmate, it is not about what other people say or what options or preferences you have; to find a soulmate, you must exercise your freedom, follow your inner voice and its determination, and stand strong with your courage. First, you have to connect and stand firm on your true self to find your true lover.\\nHence, to get in touch with your soulmate, first of all, you need to listen to the soft whisper reverberating from your heart that gently tells you she may not be the charming person of your dreams, but it feels as if even as strangers, we have already met for thousands of times.\\xa0There may have been other lovers of youth, beauty, possession, admiration, and passion, but only she can reach deep inside your heart and understand you just the way you are.\\nFinding your soulmate would be like stumbling\\xa0onto someone you are surprised to realize\\xa0has been shaped and carved like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that fit together only with you. With your soulmate, you get that feeling of being at ease within yourself, and there is no need for any other stimulus or incentive apart from each other’s presence to get a sense of interconnection out of this relationship.\\nMoreover, soulmates are two individuals who have realized that promising romantic love forever is a lie. Falling in love is easy, but the art of remaining committed to each other in love takes many years of practice to perfect. Even when their\\xa0love is the glue that binds them together, soulmates understand that for their relationship to last,\\xa0they need to support each other's motivations, interests, and inspirations and find commonalities between them.\\nBeing in love as soulmates means that we are both willing to make struggles and sacrifices for each other because we both realize that our love has the potential to improve, transform, redefine, and make the best out of our lives altogether. Besides, soulmates don’t play the game of pretending to remain at the center of each other’s attention, and they don't want the other person to become the shadow of their expectations, anticipations, and projections.\\nTo conclude, soulmates are two individuals with a sense of shared self that allows them to blend in, support, and sustain each other's beings together. Where there are differences, soulmates supplement and become each other’s inspiration and strength, and where there are similarities, they explore, enhance, and enjoy their mutual interests and passions together. When soulmates sit together and engage in laughter, dialogue, making love, silence, or discussions, they realize that their loving relationship gives their lives a sense of purpose together, which makes them feel complete and inseparable from each other.\\n(The author is a writer, researcher and educator at different educational institutions.

       "  '\\nThose words from my lovely wife ended our argument in the kitchen last night.\\nThe night before that, a minor difference in opinion had flickered into a tiny spark and by the time Hegel got involved the next day, it had turned into an inferno.\\nBefore we move on, let’s get to know a little about Hegel so it can help us understand where these two loving souls, my wife and I, usually depart and seldom meet again.\\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was a German Philosopher and was considered as the most important figures in German philosophy and one of the founding figures of modern Western philosophy. Leaving all the things he’s said aside, the one thing that has struck a chord with me is his theory on “shape of consciousness”.\\xa0\\nHegel says simply put, we cannot trust the certitude of our sense organs, also called sense-certainty, because that certitude is embroiled in limitations. Add to that, the human consciousness, and language upon which all sense-making is forced. That leaves no room for subjective agency. Our means of understanding our reality are encouraged, sustained, inspired, and tolerated by those sets of very weak and humanistic attributes. We are flawed in our take of our reality because the moment we set our eyes on something, it takes a form of what it means for us.\\xa0\\nNot what it is in its real essence, but what it means to a human mind.\\nImagine a botanist, a wood cutter and a CEO of a furniture company taking a walk in a forest. What they see when they look around are trees and nothing but trees.\\xa0\\nIn essence what a tree is, in-itself, they will never know. They cannot catch themselves seeing those trees from anywhere else beyond what their human mind lets them see.\\nThe botanist will see the trees in terms of cambiums and apical meristem.\\xa0\\nThe woodcutter will see those trees in terms of his livelihood and his children’s tuition.\\nThe CEO will see them in terms of how many desks his company could produce from the wood of those trees.\\nThe tree’s essence, what it is, and why it is what it is, can never find a place of its individuality because the human mind, limited within its Hegelian purview, will eat up that possibility before anything else.\\nThe tree can never be a tree in itself. Instead, it must be a tree for those three people.\\nThomas Nagel, one of my other to-go thinkers wrote a paper back in 1974 titled ‘What is it like to be a bat?’ There is no amount of knowledge or information about a bat that can tell us what it feels like to be a bat within the confines of its bat consciousness.\\xa0\\nIts hunger, its love, its breezing along the meandering swoops and its revulsions against other fellow bats--those\\xa0we shall never know. The best we could do is anthropomorphize it, like we always do in animation movies where animals tend to live up to human aspirations.\\xa0\\nA human mind is incapable of experiencing a bat’s experience and therefore will never know how a bat might feel. There simply is not a way for anyone of us to know.\\xa0Let’s be totally asserted on that truth.\\nIn the similar manner, a botanist, a woodcutter, and my lovely wife, how’s their experience any more different from the run-down of that bat’s experience we could relate to?\\nFundamentally, their personal experience that’s accessible only to them, be it during the stroll in the forest or the grunt in the kitchen, are theirs to have. I can sit here and try to relativize a woodcutter’s coveting or my wife’s annoyances, but that won’t move the dial if their shape of consciousness is absent from my reach. I can never know how she feels if I can’t own her in totality.\\nAnd this is where Hegel comes along to enlighten the predicament of the misrepresentations that becomes a foundational springboard in understanding the shape of the other person’s consciousness.\\nOur minds, our feelings and everything we claim as ours are cusped within the confines of our personal sense-making. Our experiences become relatable only if we can find a medium to universalize it in terms of human graces or grunts.\\nI don’t know if Hegel can truly do my wife’s dishes or not.\\nI am positive he will not because he died long before both of us were born.\\nNonetheless, Hegel does remind us that in absence of common reference, our words will fail us miserably.\\xa0\\nAnd when that happens our silence, perhaps, will hold more meaning.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nA dear friend that I have known for decades took his life last week leaving behind a wife, two children and many of us who have not been able to claim back our sanity. There are ten thousand unrelenting questions that are hitting hard on us, and they are not easily going away. It’s been an unsettling week for all of us.\\nWhen a tragedy like this happens, it doesn’t take place amidst the clamor of reason and resonance.\\nInstead, a decision like this is made in the retreat of a cool, calm, and collected mind. At least, that’s what Karl Menninger meditates in ‘Man against Himself’, a brilliant psychiatrist who tries to comprehend why an individual wishes to put himself in a harm’s way from which he cannot, except by suicide, escape from his life.\\nIn other words, if for his own unconscious purpose, a man brings about an apparent justification in external reality for self-destruction, then the unconscious purposes are of more significance in understanding the suicide than the apparently simple, inevitable, external circumstance that are observable to the public. For folks like you and me, the laziest and the most reckless way to make sense of someone’s decision is to try to understand his subjective decision from an objective point of view.\\nWhat Menninger is saying humbly is this.\\nWhat happens out there are particles simply hitting each other and producing a state of affairs that, when viewed from a frog’s point of view or a bird eye-view, are nothing but occasions passing along space and time. However, when we introduce a human mind to that same state of affairs, everything changes.\\xa0\\nHumans carry an unhealthy number of covenants, rules, positivity, and ought-to-be-ness that sometimes are anti-life. It works more against them than for them.\\xa0\\nIn essence, what kills a man under such circumstances is not what’s out there in the world but what’s within him. His provisional compass becomes the contingent arbiter, the judge, the jury, and the noose that can take away his life. At least, that’s what happened with my friend, it looks like.\\nI can only imagine or perhaps not, what must have gone through his mind in those last forlorn moments of despair and disquietude. I will never find out how many sins he thought he had committed when he compared his external world to Bhagavat Geeta that espouses on being a good human being. I will never find out how much short he found himself in the eyes of Hindu Gods and other deities that had, in his last moments, become toxic for him.\\nJordan Peterson is a clinical psychiatrist who perhaps is the most articulate man alive on our planet- at least that’s what the New York Times quotes him to be.\\xa0\\nPeterson makes an appeal to all, not to advise another human being on what should or should not be done, simply because you may screw up that person’s life. It doesn’t matter where such guidance comes from.\\xa0\\nBe it from the voice from heaven or from the Apollo of Delphi or from our own Krishna’s chariots from Kurukshetra. Where they come from is irrelevant but what they render to a human mind is absolutely calamitous.\\nThese oracular voices tend to be more harmful and are totally responsible for human suffering. They create a paradigm in men upon which he is constrained to build up his sense of right and wrong. And life, as you all know, is a roller coaster ride, simply because there’s always a chance for us to spill out of that paradigm.\\xa0\\nOur agency, perhaps our only tool to understand the reality may not always square perfectly with Bhagavad Gita’s diatribes against the sins that men are capable of committing. And that is exactly why no one should be damned because none can control the reality of the world. There seems no room for agency in a world of neural impulses, chemical reactions, and bone and muscle movements. Even if we add sensations, perceptions, and feelings we don’t get action, or doing—there is only what happens.\\nUnder such conditions, my friend who perhaps didn’t find his external reality 'squarely checked’ with his internal covenants saw no point in prolonging his life because he must have gotten lost on his way with no structure to guide him through. The virtues that he adhered so deeply had no place in the world he found himself in. The gods were gone.\\nHe must have found himself in that forlorn Nietzschean world where god lived no more.\\nThere were two ways to fix his problem from what I can tell.\\nFirst one was to fix the reality which essentially meant to reorganize the particles that was noumenally visible to him so it would evenly square with his virtues.\\xa0\\nThe second was to kill the gods so the world would become livable where he could breathe again.\\nUnfortunately, both options were not available to him.\\xa0And the one that he did choose, only that made all the difference to him.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWith the massive popularity and abundance of spiritual leaders, gurus, religious groups, religious media channels, and self-help publications, the\\xa0concept of spirituality has become an integral part of our collective psyche. As a result, many people believe that spiritual perspectives, techniques, and exercises can be applied to solve various mental health issues and educational and behavioral problems in modern society and influence people to make healthy lifestyle choices and meaningful life decisions.\\xa0However, most often, I find this term overused, misused, confused, and even utterly commercialized.\\nFor example, gurus, meditation teachers, mystics, yogic masters, and preachers package their spiritual techniques and craft their presence in such a way that their spiritual teaching resonates as informative, entertaining, alluring, and incentivized for a specific age group, gender, generation, profession, and for people with a specific way of life, attitude, and purchasing power. And these days, spirituality is no longer something that can be obtained without generous contributions; most of the spiritual reliefs available on the market have a price tag stitched around them.\\nOur familiar assumptions also limit our understanding of spirituality to becoming members of a spiritual sect, listening to spiritual teachers, following their instructions, and reading spiritual books regularly. But to become spiritual, one does not have to join an esoteric cult, put on religious markers, receive the spiritual energy transmission of a guru and his grace, or uncritically digest his outrageous teaching.\\nSigmund Freud, the\\xa0founder of psychoanalysis,\\xa0observed that, based on our infantile experiences, it is part of human psychology to yearn for a father figure who can guide us through this chaotic, unpredictable, and confusing world. And there are different gurus, mystics, evangelists, and spiritual masters in the spiritual market ready to take up this role as father figures because, as humans, we want to live a meaningful life, find answers to the questions about our being and suffering, and overcome the fear of death. Besides, all of us also have that feeling of being unsatisfied by material comforts, things, and achievements.\\nAs a spiritual person, I am not opposed to anyone following any spiritual teacher; however, as a follower, you must be critical enough to question their self-contradictory and baseless statements, and also, under the guise of spiritual growth, you shouldn’t be exploited, made vulnerable, or demanded to make irrational commitments and actions. We also need to\\xa0realize that nobody in this world has a truth that doesn’t need to be proved. I have met hundreds of spiritual teachers from different religious traditions, but I never forgot to keep my critical mind open. After all, the word \"spiritual\" comes from a Latin word meaning \"to breathe freely.\" As a result, becoming a free spirit—those who dare to challenge traditional beliefs, let go, and celebrate their liberation—is also a part of human spirituality.\\nAs human existence is divided into mind and matter, we need abstract and soulful substances like poetry, ideas, music, art, literature, philosophy, self-inquiry, and reflections to help us find meaning and significance in our outer actions, associations, objectives, and outcomes from our inner perspectives. In other words, to live a meaningful life, we need to find something—music, art, poetry, meditation, philosophy, or writing—that allows us to explore and engage with the outside world while maintaining our inner sense of balance, detachment, calmness, maturity, and acceptance. Hence, spirituality is a search for an equilibrium point that balances our inner and outer lives.\\nSpirituality awakens to a living reality that is self-sufficient in\\xa0itself, and nothing can be more spiritual than living in the world, where you find events, occasions, situations, relationships, explorations, and experiences that can\\xa0take you out of yourself and connect you with everyone and everything around you. We can also recognize our relative insignificance in the universe when we temporarily dissolve our egos. Similarly, spirituality urges us to embrace, adjust to, and enjoy all the recklessness and paradoxes of human life. There are contractions and confusions everywhere, but these paradoxes also make life deep, dynamic, vibrant, improbable, creative, and exciting.\\nSurely, life is unfair and unpredictable, and\\xa0as\\xa0human beings, we have to deal with lots of people, events, occurrences, and outcomes that we don\\'t like. As\\xa0everything ends, every moment of life we live, touch, love, reflect on, listen to, connect with, and experience is special, specific, unrepeatable, and unparalleled. Hence, the journey of life becomes more spiritually meaningful than its presumed destinations. This is the only life we have; therefore, everything we do, discover, relate to, and create becomes significant and valuable because we will never have another opportunity to relive and restore those fleeting moments of life.\\xa0After all, nothing can be more spiritual than to breathe in a world already overflowing with life, rhythm, a sense of wonder, beauty, and mystery.\\nWith intensity, depth of engagement, thoughtfulness, and passion, everything from meditation, yoga, and dance to driving, climbing mountains, having conversations, and having a cup of tea becomes a meaning-making process that is also spiritually enriching. Human spirituality is not something separate from our everyday lives.\\xa0For example, by reading Chekhov, walking around in the woods, writing poetry, teaching, gazing at the stars, playing with my daughter, and learning the guitar, I am able to engage in a meaning-making process and also feel the connectedness of my being with other beings and nature. And there are numerous other ways to celebrate our spirituality in the midst of our daily activities and practices.\\xa0Hence, spirituality is not the exclusive property of people with certain levels of spiritual awakening, and we do not need their blessings to become spiritual.\\nMore importantly, there is no need to elevate specific spiritual practices and religious rituals above any other ordinary human activities. With a little forethought, emotion engagement, love, passion, depth in involvement, and awareness in every ounce of our fleeting human existence, we can spiritualize our individual lives.\\xa0\\n(The author is a writer, researcher and educator at different educational institutions.

       "  '\\nIn the age of consumerism, we as individuals are forming our mindsets and behaviors based on what we have learned from different advertisements, social media contents, blog posts, expert opinions, TikTok, celebrity endorsements on Instagram, TV reality shows, the latest viral trends and contents, product positioning, celebrity lifestyles, movies, and so on.\\nAs a result, we are influenced by the suggestions, persuasions, and symbolic meaning we have derived from these sources and develop our taste, preferences, decisions, comparisons, and lifestyle choices accordingly.\\nSimilarly, we also learn so much about loving relationships from the narratives of love symbolized in movies and songs. Likewise, we like to read guidebooks on the art of loving to enhance our love, replicate the love lives of different social media influencers, and make love decisions based on consumer values of use and disposal. When it comes to choosing gifts for your girlfriend, you also seek expert advice and adhere to their guidelines in order to provide her with the ultimate experience of your love.\\nJust to give an example of this learning because of the influence of pop songs these days, for modern lovers, breakup has simply become a natural or obvious stage of the love cycle, \\xa0comparable to any other product life cycle where, after peak experiences of love, there will be decline and discontinuity.\\nBeing in love also becomes useless when excitement begins to weaken and the boredom of repetition starts to creep in, and at that moment, you can\\xa0\"shake it off,\"\\xa0as Taylor Swift reminded us; indeed, if\\xa0you can\\'t make him stay, you can at least shake him off. Breakups aren\\'t tragic, brokenhearted, or sad. Don\\'t waste your emotions grieving over him; save your emotions for someone else you\\'ll find again.\\xa0Now you are better off being apart than together, as\\xa0“The Breakup Song” lyrics from \"Ae Dil Hai Mushkil\"\\xa0remind us, and breakups have become just another reason to reignite your passion, take charge of your life again, and party with friends rather than hang on and grieve over a stale relationship.\\nLikewise, we feel that exchanging various products developed as gifts and engaging in modern-day love rituals would prolong, strengthen, and enrich our loving relationships. Modern-day love rituals like Rose, Chocolate, and Teddy Days, candlelight dinners,\\xa0Valentine\\'s Day gift packages,\\xa0and\\xa0diamond rings and bracelets make so much sense in consumer culture because the products and services that are available in the market can be used to signify and express a person\\'s quantum of love.\\nLove has surely become costly. With so many products and services in the consumer market that symbolize and signify different features, dimensions, depths, and expressions of love, lovers need to have sufficient purchasing power to exchange, enjoy, and experience love in all its colors, exuberance, and facets.\\nFrom restaurants, vacations, shopping, birthday celebrations, night outs, romantic dates, and weekly gifts to movie theaters, different portions of love hang everywhere, and you need to purchase them to enrich your loving relationships. Indeed, you can consume these products and services with your partner in order to enhance your experience of being in love and make it more satisfying and exciting.\\nFalling in love in the age of consumerism becomes so irrelevant, less exciting, dull, and meaningless if you can\\'t buy your portion of love.\\nAs a result, much of human love and relationship in this consumer age is nurtured by an individual\\'s consuming capacity and purchasing power rather than genuine passion, sacrifice, a sense of togetherness, trust, support, and tolerance for each other. We have started to view people as commodities that can be exchanged, consumed, and disposed of.\\nMoreover, falling in love has become some kind of window shopping where we look for different categories of image, expectation, satisfaction, and anticipation in someone to fall in love with, just like we go through a catalog to find a suitable product with essential features, functions, qualities, possibilities, and consumer benefits. As with other products, if it serves our purpose, our relationship will last for years; otherwise, it will be dumped and replaced if it fails to meet our expectations.\\nBesides, based on our consumer mindset, we think that we can easily dump a person and find a replacement rather than engage in the difficult tasks of acceptance, accommodations, and conflict resolution. After all, a loving relationship is interchangeable from the standpoint of a consumer; thus, like any rational consumer, we are free to dispose of the other person when we are confident enough to realize that we can now possess an upgraded model than what we currently have.\\nIn the age of consumerism, our ways of loving and being in relationships also resemble how we would interact with and react to any other consumer product available on the market. Loving someone is just a part of consumer behavior.\\nJust as consumers have learned to seek temporary satisfaction—something attractive that immediately makes us happy for a moment—we all have become collectors of transient moments in love. Lovers may post their pictures or reveal their intimate confessions of love to the public in a manner of showing off, but lovers always feel insecure about being disposed of, dropped, or interchanged. And like our affection for any other consumer product, after a while, love also fades away.\\nLoving relationships have indeed become liquid.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPatan is a historical city situated in Lalitpur District of Nepal, inhabited by the people of Newar community. A remarkable characteristic of this city is its portrayal of religious harmony between Hindus and Buddhists in every aspect of the community. Being born and raised here, I got more and more interested in the city when I started doing my graduate studies in Urban Planning, and the insights have been truly fulfilling.\\nSustainable cities are the pressing need of modern times. City planners use tactics such as zoning, open space allocation, walkability, urban growth boundaries, satellite cities and many more to achieve this, but the way in which the then planners of Patan achieved this is truly worth learning.\\nLet me take you through Patan in the 17th century. To start with, “Astamatrika”, the eight mother goddesses, and “Dashamahavidya”, the 10 goddesses, were established to set the boundary for urban expansion. The faith in these places of worship was such that people did not go beyond the perimeter set by the goddesses. This protected the lower fertile agricultural land, while the higher ground was used for settlement. So the perimeter boundary directed the development to be compact, and thus walkable. However, though there was compactness, there were ample urban open spaces and lung spaces (green spaces). Urban open spaces named “Lachi”, “Nani”, “Bahal” & “Bahi” were preserved and each was tied with its respective religious belief system (Hinduism or Buddhism), such that no one encroached upon it (unlike our open spaces!). For lung spaces named “khyo”, different festivals and socio-cultural events were planned such that the space would be in constant care. Also, open spaces of ecological importance were tied with various rituals too. The planners then had the vision and the creative methods to protect these open spaces.\\n\\nAstamatrika of Patan (Source: Google Earth)\\n\\nMoving further into the city, the form of residential quarters shows the importance given to communal living. The houses are clustered around an inner courtyard, giving room for private spaces inside houses, while ensuring access to a larger public space for everyone. This model with slight deviations is becoming popular with Western developers too.\\n\\nNewa Chen, a 17th-century building, renovated in 2006 with help from UNESCO\\n\\nIn the case of zoning, it was “zoning by jaat” or “zoning by profession”. Though the concept of “jaat” led to social discrimination, in those days it was primarily used to create “homogeneous communities by occupation” to create agglomeration and economies of scale. With all this in place, when the population still exceeded a certain limit, a satellite town was established with linkages to the main town, to curb the effects of overpopulation.\\nSo this begs the question, how was this extraordinary feat made possible? Certainly, the planners were quite creative and the tool they used was ritual mediation. The meanings given by the people to these rituals had bound the people. They put tremendous faith in rituals and religion. But now, as with every historic city, Patan is going through the process of degeneration. At times the rituals can be seen to be performed only for the sake of rituals, without paying enough attention to the deeper purpose of sustainability, which they hoped to achieve. This situation has brought forth a new set of challenges, which calls for maximum creative efforts by planners to establish newer meanings. An example could be, the lung spaces mentioned earlier being protected through socio-cultural events might be adjusted by giving access to schools for their events in culture and sports, in case the previous ties grow weaker.\\nHistory serves as a record of experiences and learning, but not as a rule book. It is up to us to learn from the experiences of the past, and come up with creative solutions to tackle the challenges of the present and future.\\nMay the planners of the future write as highly of us as we write about the planners of the past.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nIn a very odd manner, every possible world tends to exist in ways that are not entirely physical. A world that could be described in words but is devoid of any space-time convergence. Our dreams, for example, don't have any physical run-down. They just appear real to the dreamer and yet leave in a wisp when they are over. The dreamer then is left with the memory of the world that never gets to come alive, the world of zero substance, and the world whose absence is the very reason that gives meaning to the world that gets to live forward.\\nThe nonappearance of every possible version of our other realities makes it possible for this reality to emanate into the physical world that matters to us the most. This is where we find ourselves. This is the one that has its claim on us. Think about the person you didn’t marry, the child that wasn’t born to you, the winter that failed to bring the snow and the friendship that couldn’t find its morning in the dew of little things and didn’t get refreshed.\\nIn that sense, all that didn’t happen in a life is the very life blood of what did happen in a very bizarre and asymmetrical manner. The relationship between those two worlds is just the fringe line that makes those two worlds mutually coeval. Not just the one that claims me but also the one that I am absent from.\\xa0\\nThis is the world that I ponder about all the time.\\xa0This is also where I find myself present in my absence.\\xa0\\nThose two roads that diverged in the woods and the one Robert Frost didn’t take,\\xa0\\nWhat happened to that road?\\xa0\\nDid it wither away?\\xa0\\nOr did it somehow become a critical part of the one that was taken? Frost’s grievance about the road not taken makes one wonder what the real loss to him was.\\xa0\\nThe road that he didn’t take is as necessary as the one he did take.\\xa0\\nFor if it were not for the one untaken, the taken would lose its significance.\\xa0\\nHowever, unlike Robert Frost, there are moments in life where two roads don’t always diverge into the yellow wood. In fact, I only see one road ahead of me. And this one doesn’t lead to the yellow wood. Instead, it leads to this huge strip of a green hill. In the midst of that hill, there’s a big oak tree. Under it, I see a man waiting for something, or perhaps someone. I don’t know.\\nSo, I hesitate for a moment, but then I move toward\\xa0him to get closer.\\nThe story of his life is the story of anyone’s life. He has had his share of life’s ups and downs in this world that claims him in all its hue and tinge. The man’s loss of his love, his aspirations, his honor, his will, and all that makes him the hero of his device, all that is taken away.\\xa0\\nThis is the man who doesn’t look straight at me. I cannot clearly see him.\\nHis voice grooved and barely audible, as if he is telling the story of his life to himself. My presence doesn't seem to bother him. He is speaking very softly, and he is speaking of the life he missed to be a part of. This life, the one under the oak, isn’t his for him. He is a stranger here.\\nThe life, he thinks, belongs to him is in the negative space. It is the space that can only be imagined or dreamed of. This is where he finds his completions.\\xa0\\nHis love, his honor, his aspirations, and everything that makes him a whole, it happens in this imagined space.\\nThis is his home, the one built on his absences.\\nNonetheless, he seems not to understand that both these worlds, the one under the oak tree and the one away from it are his to claim.\\nOne subdued in the background while the other bulged out into physical space.\\xa0\\nBoth these two realms are necessary for this forlorn man to become a whole.\\nTake away one and the other ceases to live.\\xa0\\nI look at him again, and this time, he looks right back at me.\\nThe man slowly moves as if to talk to me. He leans forward.\\nNow, I see his face in my deepest awe. I know this man!\\xa0\\nThis is the man from that hill. The man from under the oak tree.\\nI recognize him now. This man is me.\\xa0\\nI am the man under that oak tree.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI can understand when philosopher Slavoj Zizek sees happiness as unethical. For many of us happiness seekers, his assertion may sound rather surprising. However, I think Zizek is right with his claim, if our appetite for maximizing our happiness now impacts ecological collapse, puts the existence of future generations on this planet at a greater risk and also compromises the ability of the future generations to meet their needs without strife and needless sufferings. Besides, in an age of hyperconsumerism, we have placed our habits of happiness on a shallow myth that we can’t be happy without having. And, we have mindlessly decided to overlook the bitter truth that many of our happiness choices are detrimental to the ecology and sustainability. Similarly, our search for happiness can be unethical if we stifle and undermine the happiness of others for our selfish fulfillments. We see this in our family life, where most parents add needless sorrows in the lives of their children for not keeping up with their choices, expectations and preferences.\\nMy own search for happiness reminds me that the road I am traveling on is full of potholes. And, by traveling on this bumpy road, I have realized that happiness always appears in our life in unusual shapes, sounds and sizes. Hence, there are little puddles of humor, fun, playfulness and joys everywhere. Moreover, in my search for happiness, I have unearthed some essential ingredients for a happy life.\\nTo live a happy life, firstly, we need to respect and admire others for their unique ways of being in the world. Some like to make noise, others crave silence, and some like to be in front and others like to shout from the back. Hence, rather than comparing people, we need to admire people for who they are, what they have been through and how they like to engage with other people. With this respect we can both increase and improve our human relationships, the way we relate to each other, which is essential for a happy life.\\nThe next ingredient for a happy life is that we need to have enough courage so that we can avoid becoming a chasing shadow of other people’s expectations, projections and desires. Without courage, our life would be nothing more than a tedious circle of compulsions and compromises. And, it also takes enormous courage to be satisfied with who we are and what we have right now.\\nFinally, so much of our happiness depends on our ability to let go of our sense of control. In a world of imperfections, how our life unfolds and how people decide to act and react with us are beyond our absolute control. Hence, rather than holding onto the ropes of our expectations tightly, we need to let go and enjoy what remains of it, the experience of life, with all its random surprises - and that’s what happiness is.\\nSources of Happiness\\nThe most important source of happiness in our life is not what we have with us or what we want to have sooner or later, rather, streams of happiness begin to sprout in our life abundantly when we begin to realize that our human life is indeed little and we can’t go on postponing our happiness by attaching it to some event, situation or to an achievement that we may never encounter in our short life. None of us have a written script of our life with us and as we strive toward our dreams and possibilities, often the drama of life turns out the way we never suspected.\\nAnd, to find happiness in those messy and confusing moments of our life we need to recognize that patterns of human life are unwritten, uncalled for and unpredictable. Even with our utmost preparedness none of us can systematically dictate the course of our life with our own will. Therefore, in order to live a happy life we need to replace the concept of happiness as a destination with the concept of happiness as a process. After all, so much of the happiness we experience in our life depends on how we react to what is happening in and around us.\\nMost of us are unhappy because we think of happiness in terms of when or how we are going to be happy. Whereas we can create happiness even in difficult situations of our life by remaining resolute in our inner conviction that with whatever we have we can always recreate our life once again. Besides, when we have nothing else to do, even counting what we already have also makes us happy. Despite having many things, many of us are miserable with a single thought of why we don’t have with us what the rest of the world already has.\\nHaving is not enough; happiness happens when we do something that makes us feel worthwhile, energetic, focused, connected, purposeful and engaged. For example, we can learn new stuff, develop new habits, cultivate new friends, make life easy for ourselves, let go of expectations that pull us down and sometimes take a step back to see things anew. Moreover, life is not fair and all of us don’t need equal things to be equally happy. Our struggles also give us a sense of happiness when we realize that we are maturing as a human being climbing new heights.\\nFinally, I feel that the most precious source of happiness is always cheap, ordinary, plentiful, spontaneous and free. Just the other day, I was witnessing clouds in the sky, which seemed like building tiny steps into eternity, and these clouds floating in the sky made me feel relaxed and fulfilled for a while. I know there is nothing special about clouds playing in the sky. However, all we get in life are the moments to become happy and it depends on how we add these moments\\xa0 to our experiences and make our life a satisfying journey.\\nHappiness: A Journey\\nWhenever I ponder over my quest for a flourishing life, I take the words of poet T.S. Elliot rather seriously as he has written somewhere in one of his poems that, we shall not cease from exploration/and the end of all our exploring/we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time. In essence, our search for happiness begins with oneself and culminates within oneself. However, in a world of constant distractions, denials, self-deceptions and delusions, for most of us it is rather discomforting to be at ease, comfort or at peace with oneself.\\nAfter witnessing and experiencing various ups and downs in our life and facing up to all the troubles and sorrows that life throws at us from time to time, our search for happiness turns full circle when we realize that the ultimate joy in our life begins to overflow profoundly when we become true to ourselves standing before the mirror of our life, embracing its true reflections and finding freedom within our self. But, the paradox here is that only those who know how to spread out their self find happiness within them. Hence, in our search for happiness we also realize that happiness is not something we experience in isolation and that we derive most of our happiness by connecting with people around us.\\nMoreover, the journey of life takes its own turn and we also need to adopt, adjust and add a sense of growth and maturity with our age as various phases of our life have their own peculiar sources of joy for us to rediscover. Here, for many people their search for happiness becomes delusional, self-destructive and indulgent, when they fail to comprehend this reality of human life. Hence, to experience happiness at different junctures, we need to rephrase and reshape our dreams, hopes, wishes, relationships and expectations, adopting the emerging realities of our life. Besides, as long as we are pursuing happiness, our search becomes like running about from one circle to another trying to find something that exists like a mirage appearing in the dry wilderness; it appears at once and escapes in another moment. And, while journeying on rough and tough roads of our life in search of happiness, often we need to take a pause and shift our mind from the loops of desiring and expecting to life itself where everything is alive and happening.\\nLastly, rather than finding, happiness is just about letting go and losing oneself in the moment with whatever ordinary we have, a piece of music, art, dance, reflection, love, friendship, conversation, meditation , sex, fun or poetry. After all, happiness is always with us, it simply needs a bit of inner tuning and with our sense of ease, acceptance and comfort within oneself, we can catch its vibrations all around us echoing.\\n(Gaurav Ojha is a faculty of communication, critical thinking and business research at different educational institutions.

       "  '\\nRabindra Mishra’s new alliance with the Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, virtually a political arm of the former king, has hogged much of the limelight in recent days. The comfort with which he has gelled with his new companions indicates that Mishra is much more at ease under the former king’s patronage than he ever was during his brief, if half-hearted, stint as a republican with the Bibeksheel Sajha Party. The palpable ease with which he has hugged the institution of monarchy shows that he has finally sloughed off his outer skin and has decided to openly and unequivocally put the money where his mouth is. In deciding to abandon his previous niceties–both in his ideology as well as his speech–Mishra has replaced his finger wagging schoolmarmish style, with a metaphorical sledge-hammer and has decided to wield it against the nascent democracy questioning its very foundations.\\nIt is no wonder that Mishra has tapped into a powerful mix of grievances and resentment of the old guard, those who typically were the beneficiaries of–and did well under–the former king’s and his predecessor’s patronage. If the “likes” and “retweets” on Twitter are any indication, even those who claim to be a “Global Citizen from Gulmi” seem to be tacitly endorsing a patently parochial view based on medieval superstitions.\\nThat a child born in a certain family inherently holds a superior position to the rest of us and accordingly has an in-born right to rule as an “enlightened guardian”–something that Mishra is advocating for–is a notion that would invoke laughter and ridicule if it was not so dangerous and foolish.\\nNow, to his credit, I think Mishra is indirectly and unwittingly serving democracy by holding the banner of opposition against, among other things, the cronyism and kleptocracy of our current leaders. The current crop of leaders are indeed undermining Nepal’s fledgling democracy by their own incompetence and widespread grift. Our democratic institutions, unfortunately, have not matured enough to curb the excesses of our leaders and a sensible conservatism, I believe, does have an important role to play in the current political climate.\\nHowever, by advocating for the resurrection of a dated institution that has been the provenance of bigotry, arbitrary hierarchy, and authoritarian policies in the past, Mishra is doing nothing more than expressing his frustration against the radical leveling of human dignity that has followed the Maoist Revolution in Nepal.\\nFor all its chaos and cravenness, there is no denying that the Maoist revolution initiated an era of modernity that valued the minorities and indigenous people as human beings with their own individuality and human dignity, something that was denied to them for centuries under the structural discriminations created and sustained under various monarchical regimes.\\nMishra’s belief that a “soft dictator” should always hover over the heads of Nepali people–ready to unleash the punitive power of the state at its will–not only belies ignorance of human psychology and its cravings for unlimited power, but, more importantly, is indicative of a limited historical understanding of how democracy functions and delivers.\\nDemocracy, though a rule of the majority, ensures fundamental freedoms and protects the rights of the minorities. It is an inherently messy system which by default favors wheeling and dealing among various political actors instead of dealing in quick fixes along clean and defined lines. Unfortunately the bad tags along with the good in a democracy, and it is one of the vital duties of a politician to see that the good comes out on top. However, men are not angels and therefore democracy requires institutional maturity and independence to hold the political actors accountable whenever they cross the legal and normative boundaries. And those boundaries are set not only by courts and government agencies but also by the society at large. An intelligent politician more attuned to the aspirations of modern times would try to align our Byzantine institutions–the actual root of our current problem–with the promises enshrined in our current Constitution, however lacking those may be. It is no doubt easier said than done; however, a great leader knows that not everything can be achieved in one’s lifetime. A good leader knows that our present should not define our future because politics at heart is about what ought to be rather than what is.\\nInstead Mishra has decided to provoke the latent elements in our society that are atavistic, backward, and superstitious. By surrendering his conscience at the altar of His Highness, Mishra, I believe, is doing a disservice to the ideology of conservatism itself. In his interviews he regularly waxes nostalgic about what we have lost as a culture and community, but rarely does he acknowledge what we have gained as a nation. The laundry list of his complaints are long and consist mainly of the natural consequences that result when a society long held on a chokehold of arbitrary power breaks free. The Nepali people have freed themselves from an arbitrary power that could snatch our freedom at will. We have laid the groundwork for a positive, scientific, and a forward looking country where the minorities and the indigenous have an equal ownership in the nation. It would be a significant backward step to take that away from the people and hand it over to a hereditary power that could potentially pull the plug on our democracy on its whim. Are we really up for that?\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nWhat does the future of humanity look like? Machine learning and artificial intelligence are pushing all kinds of business, innovation, research and other areas to a whole new level, especially in developed countries. The time has come for Nepal to embrace the power of machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle the difficult problems that the country has faced for centuries. Natural disasters, precision agriculture, managing road traffic, environmental sustainability are the perfect candidates for the next technological revolutions.\\nAs a middle school student in America, I have had the privilege of learning programming and machine learning along with theoretical foundations from experts in the field. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning the foundations of data science and machine learning so that we not only help the country to grow with a future army of machine learning experts, but also smooth out the wrinkles of the gender gap in Nepal. It is obvious that one of the most significant steps toward breaking the gender barrier is through empowering girls. Let's make it happen!\\nYour future is powered by code; if you want to build for the future, you'll need to learn how to code. Here, I propose an innovative idea about the most sophisticated tool that is transforming the world right now. I invite the girls of Nepal to join me in learning how to code for predictive analytics and machine learning. My purpose for this call is twofold: first, to contribute to reducing the gender gap, and second, to have fun teaching coding and machine learning.\\nCoding, or computer programming, is a vital tool in science, engineering, business and many other fields that will help you tremendously in achieving your goals. Coding is the language of machine learning and predictive analytics. The developed countries of the world are undergoing a major transformation in their economies thanks to the very powerful algorithms of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). But how does it work?\\nMachine learning is a futuristic idea that has been in the making for quite some time now. It is a set of algorithms that predicts patterns and data on a large scale. Machines are learning how to process vast amounts of data in order to improve our lives in ways we can't even fathom. Machine learning is a set of computer algorithms that learn how to make predictions based on the information provided. With human intelligence, it is difficult to make predictions with datasets that are too large, complex, or vast. In contrast, machines will be able to take the data and make the predictions that humans cannot.\\nTake an example of AlphaGo with which began the global sensation of AI. Designed in 2015, AlphaGo, an AI with unimaginable power, won against the best of the best in the game of Go. The best part is, the designer of AlphaGo has no clue how to play the game.\\nWhereas AlphaGo is an example of a full-blown powerful AI, what I am proposing here is the route to becoming a specialist in various types of predictive analytics and machine learning. Conventionally, AI has been treated as a broad spectrum of techniques that solve a computational task. This can theoretically include many techniques, many of them being not-so-great historically. Machine learning is a suite of powerful statistical models and algorithms that have developed dramatically in these last few decades. These days, when the media talks about AI, they usually refer to a specific version of the ML models called deep learning or its variants.\\nMachine learning is a remarkable set of technologies that can be used for a wide variety of applications. One of the algorithms I’ve written is 97% accurate in detecting breast cancer. For this, I used a database of over 11,000 medical records published online. The model I wrote learns to distinguish a case of breast cancer from a healthy breast by comparing many characteristics of breasts afflicted with cancer versus the ones without. Machine learning is the foundation of the future of healthcare. Experts believe that half of the medical discoveries and innovations will come from machine learning in a decade, as opposed to the current heavy reliance on hard-core scientific research as of now.\\nMachine learning algorithms are used for many kinds of applications such as in healthcare, email filtering, speech recognition, computer vision, search engine queries, and many more. The question is, can we create an army of ML experts in Nepal and make a dent in the gender gap with the proper training and mindset?\\nMachine learning, specifically AI driven by the architecture of deep learning model, is transforming the industries of the developed world. Whereas all these achievements sound far-fetched, especially in a developing country like Nepal, they were all achieved with the application of powerful algorithms. For that, all you need is a passion to learn how to code and to learn the theory. I am myself learning machine learning, and have already been able to use some of the machine learning models I have programmed in various predictions. It gives me pleasure when I can teach what I have learnt and help reduce the gender gap at the same time. If you are curious about coding, data engineering and machine learning, join me online in gaining this new knowledge.\\nIn this programming and machine learning course, I will walk you through the basics of programming. This foundational material about scripting is the first step in programming of any type of analytics. And this is going to enrich you with a whole new suite of scripts to perform many essential tasks in analytics. The skills in foundational programming will also come handy when you want to solve many kinds of real-world problems. For example, I like to program and solve problems that come up in college-level probability courses. I am able to do this via programming even when I don’t understand the math.\\nI have created a few articles showing several of these problems, their code, and solutions. For example, roll several dice at the same time and if you observe the same number in more than one dice repeatedly, those outcomes can be simulated with the code I published here. In another article here, I show how the chances of two students in a group of 25 having the birthday on the same day are actually pretty high. I have also published my code here to find the probabilities of various kinds of card games. In addition, I simulated the famed Monty Hall Problem to solve the puzzling question as to which choice would help you win the game. The simulation of the situation [available at my GitHub] revealed that the answer was not what I had thought.\\nWhereas you can do many types of problem-solving with the basics of programming like I showed above, the main goal of this first course is to get ready for machine learning. Once the basics of programming are completed, I will walk you through several models of machine learning. If you are interested, sign up today for this free course. All you need is a computer, and the desire to learn!\\nRegistration form: [Link]\\n(Roselyn Mainali is a middleschooler in Maryland, USA.

       "  '\\nI come from the Chepang community, one of the most backward communities in Nepal and categorized as a highly marginalized community by the National Federation for Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN). As I belong to and grew up in this community, it motivated me to write a reflective piece on the contributions of education and the bottlenecks for the Chepang community in the current educational pedagogy in Nepal.\\nThe Chepang community falls behind in different socioeconomic indicators such as literacy and access to health and basic infrastructure, as well as in different socioeconomic categorizations. Despite support\\xa0from several NGOs, INGOs and constant support from the government, the Chepang community continues to remain in a dire situation. There were several non-formal education programs conducted by NGOs which have enabled target groups to become aware so that they can help themselves. Despite the continuous flow of aid, however, the desired socio-economic transformation has not been seen in the Chepang community. This gives ample supporting statement on why there has been less development in the Chepang community. Literacy rate is still low, most of them still live below the poverty line, and they are far behind in the human development index and similar indicators. There are indigenous communities who made a leap in income-generating activities, adult literacy programs, and other development activities. Chepang people, however, still lag behind on all fronts.\\nEvery year thousands of students complete SEE, higher secondary education or bachelor’s degree out of whom few are from the Chepang community. Despite structural and historical disadvantages, a few Chepangs excel in their academic career. Even after Chepangs are able to complete their education in spite of several hardships, they need to compete with others for Public Service Commission, non-governmental, skills-based and other jobs. Those who are able to receive good schooling are at least exposed to multiple facilities including access to computer learning, libraries and sports, and so might have enriched their general knowledge and have a competitive advantage when applying for jobs. But the ones like students from the Chepang community who mostly complete\\xa0school from a place where there are limited facilities, exposure and training, find it difficult to compete with the batch of students with whom they pass\\xa0SEE or high school together. Lack of basic computer skills, training and exposure puts them at a disadvantage in the application process. However, there are a few exceptions where a student who completed schooling from a remote part of the country competed and excelled in many aspects. This gives ample space to reflect on what is holding the Chepang community back – whether it is the current pedagogy or the incompetency within students from the Chepang community.\\n\\nEducation as a means to reproduce inequality for Chepang community\\nIt is clearly seen in Nepal that those who can afford expensive tuition fees, mostly those from economically well-off backgrounds, tend to send their children to private schools, colleges and universities because they think that expensive schools provide quality education.\\nWhen selecting schools and colleges for their children, parents with fat wallets in Nepal take into account the infrastructure of the institution, well-decorated classrooms, transportation, computer labs, swimming pools, basketball courts, football grounds and other facilities. These parents believe that quality education is provided by such schools with proper infrastructure and other facilities. Although it might be a subjective measurement for quality education as indicators, this will make a substantial impact on what students will learn in what environment. Though these may not be good indicators for measurement, what students will learn and how they will learn will certainly make an impact on the overall learning process. And yes, it is certain that students from better economic backgrounds can afford private tutors and attend private schools. Several studies have also found out the positive relations between students’ economic backgrounds and their test scores. These components contribute to differential academic performance in schools which is directly related to the income of a student’s family.\\nThe Chepangs, most of whom come from a poor and downtrodden socioeconomic background, cannot generally attend expensive schools unless they are provided scholarships, subsidies and other benefits. So, students from affluent families go to well-off schools while those from poor economic background attend economic schools. These are the initial indicators for students leading to learning disparities that reinforce social inequality. These substantiate that schools provide competitive learning environments to advantaged children compared to disadvantaged children where schools reproduce or exacerbate some inequalities.\\nTo illustrate with a real-life example, I asked\\xa0my sister Simran Praja (name changed) who is waiting for her grade 12 results. She is not familiar with what a CV or resume is. She also does not have computer knowledge and skills which are a prerequisite in today’s job market. Basic email communication, searching for jobs, applying for jobs and getting shortlisted is a tall order. There are only a handful of Chepang representatives in government services. Hence, preparing for Public Service Commission jobs is also a difficult task although it’s not impossible.\\nHence, these real-life examples clearly show the challenges faced by Chepang students even after they manage to complete basic schooling, high school and even university education. The quality of education that Chepang students are getting is leading them nowhere. A research on Chepangs in 2011 found out that Chepangs had more access to education than before, but the quality of education that Chepang students were receiving was below average. Though a growing number of students were enrolled in schools, children were now just going through the rituals of schooling rather than learning and preparing for their secure future.\\n\\nEducational journey stymies\\xa0Chepang’s development\\nReflecting on my personal experience of growing up in a Chepang community where there is material deprivation, lack of fulfillment of basic needs and other necessities further deprives the Chepang students of a learning environment. Several studies claim that material deprivation also leads to low educational achievement in schools as students coming from low economic strata tend to lack education materials, environment and parental\\xa0guidance throughout. To illustrate with an example, poverty plays a crucial role in Chepang children dropping out of school. Some may not be able to afford an education while some drop out in the middle due to household responsibilities. To support the claim one study states that cultural factors play a significant role in Chepang girls dropping out of school as Chepang people expect girls to help their families with household chores, leaving many girls at home during the harvest season and festivals when their families need their help. The author claims that many girls do not attend classes on a regular basis because of household duties such as cutting grass for animals, cooking food, cleaning and taking care of younger siblings.\\nEven during the recent COVID crisis in Nepal, several students from poor economic backgrounds could not afford to purchase phones and internet data packs which hampered their class attendance. As a result, they could not attend online classes in schools, ultimately leading to many school dropouts in the last two years. Most of the school-going children from the Chepang community had to discontinue their education during the pandemic for lack of internet access, technology and devices, resulting in a large number of dropouts.\\nThese reflections and arguments are also backed up by contributions in sociology by scholars\\xa0such as Luis Althusur, Downey and Condron who claim that education acts as a means for reproduction of ruling class ideology where dominant class ideology is taught. The scholarly\\xa0claims that schools act\\xa0as engines of inequality dominate contemporary sociology of education even though\\xa0schools play little role in generating achievement gaps.\\xa0These educational institutions act as a social sorting machine, creating categories that serve as the foundation of later life inequalities. These categories contribute to production of inequalities within schools and beyond.\\nWay forward for Chepangs: Technical education as a ray of hope\\nDevelopment agencies still tend to impose their own agenda rather than fulfilling the requirements of Chepangs. Some of the common instances are awareness activities such as financial frugality, use of contraceptives, use of pit latrine, growing cash crops, forming mothers groups, training on tailoring, youth clubs, and ability to sign one’s name. Where is the indigenous knowledge and the prior knowledge that the Chepang community possesses? Why did income-based learning not become a priority for this vulnerable and poor community? Technical and vocational education is gradually gaining popularity in the Chepang community. Technical certified jobs like staff nurse, overseer, electrician, plumber, health assistant are now becoming a way forward for the Chepang community. There are growing numbers of staff nurses who are already in local level health posts on government contracts. These small steps also play a key role in helping the Chepang community support their families, siblings in accessing education and other opportunities.\\nAs most of the Chepang people are below the poverty line, the government needs to give priority to creating more employment opportunities so that everyone can get work. Given that a majority of youths from the community are less educated and have dropped out halfway through school, the country needs to train and mobilize them in the development process. Productivity-focused training skills, recognizing prior learning of Chepangs should be imparted with inclusive targeting to the Chepang community which can provide access to work. This entire process not only helps the country’s economy to grow but also enables the Chepang youths to earn their livelihoods.\\n(The author\\xa0is currently pursuing M Phil at Kathmandu University School of Education)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAs I sit by my ailing father, I have an impression of him representing an era of slowly vanishing Limbu culture and tradition of Mundhum-based rites and rituals.\\nI still vividly remember how vehemently he performed the ritual of Tongsing Takma as a Yeba (Limbu shaman assigned for carrying out various rituals) some decades ago. In the night of the ritual performance, he would wear long white robe tightened at the waist, a headdress decorated with the feathers of different birds and garlands made from the beads of rudraksha. For the whole night, he would recite Mundhum and dance around the bamboo pole known as Yagesing fixed for the ritual in the middle of the courtyard. As a boy, I could hardly grasp the eloquence of his Mundhum recitation and message of those rich oral scriptures. For me, the event was simply an occasion of celebration and fun where I enjoyed ludicrously following and copying his dancing steps and panicked and thrilled being chased by him in the middle of the ritual performance along with others.\\nBack then, Limbu community operated differently. They observed their own distinct life rituals including Tongsing Takma. The night of Tongsing Takma was not only an event for ritual performance but it was also a social gathering for the entire villagers. Some of them would come to join hands for the different responsibilities including feeding Tongba (millet beer served in a wooden barrel shaped vessel) and other local liquor to the visitors while others would come to know their fortune from the words of the Yeba, my father. Others joined the Yeba and his Yagapsiba (assistant of the Yeba) in the ritual dance carrying and beating brass plates. For majority of villagers, it was a pure form of an entertainment free of invitation. Everyone was welcomed in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual.\\nThe decade of 1990 ushered prodigious changes in Nepali politics as well as in sociocultural realms. The Janaandolan\\xa0of 1990 saw an end of absolute monarchy\\xa0replaced by\\xa0constitutional monarchy and multiparty system ending three decades of party-less Panchayat\\xa0system imposed by King Mahendra in 1960. The same decade also worked as a harbinger for the country embracing neoliberal ideals as the panacea for socio-economical transformation. Nobody thought of far-reaching implications of the incipient systems to the local language, culture, knowledge system and social structures of the indigenous people.\\nSame applied to the Limbu people, chiefly inhabiting the eastern part of Nepal. \\xa0In addition to joining British and Indian armies as Lahure, many Limbu youths followed the footsteps of other Nepali migrant workers making destinations mainly to Malaysia and the Gulf Cooperative Council countries including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Kuwait among others. As foreign employment became a major source of income for many a Nepali households in the last three decades, it further provided an impetus for people to migrate from the hills and mountains to the plain regions of Tarai and from rural villages to city and towns, thus bringing unprecedented changes in rubrics of society and culture.\\nSuch migration trends not only resulted in the shortage of working age people in the villages but also brought changes in demographic and economic structures of towns and countryside leaving the family members of migrant workers increasingly dependent on the remittance they send from abroad. Accordingly, people fell under the charm of consumerism ultimately debilitating the bonds of social relationship and cultural convictions of the indigenous people. As everybody seemed lost in the reservoirs of containment by hailing the contribution of Nepali migrant workers to the economic development of Nepal, nobody seemed cognizant of the disconcerting side of the coin, the breakdown in the family structures and cultural mosaics. The void was not only created in the local labor markets, but also in the urgency of indigenous cultural behaviors and ritual practices.\\nIn the past, my father used to remain busy throughout the year serving the village households as Yeba, performing different rituals of Limbu community like Sappok Chomen (ritual for womb worshipping prior to birth), Mangenna (ritual for good health, peace and progress), Mekkhim (ritual for marriage ceremony) etc. Due to his engagement in such activities of the community, I sometimes used to hear him complaining about not having time for his own household chores as a farmer. But he readily served the community on such occasions. I still remember how my father used to take pride in his narratives of being kidnapped by a supernatural wild shaman in his childhood who taught him the sacred knowledge of Mundhum and turned himself a self learnt Yeba, as one of the chosen persons by the God to save Limbu community from the various misfortunes and sickness. Gradually, my father and fellow Limbu shamans commonly called as Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma not only found their roles being drastically limited within the community, but they also failed to pass their knowledge to the next generation.\\nHermeneutics of Tongsing Mundhum\\nAccording to Mundhum scholar Bairagi Kaila, Tongsing Mundhum is an extreme expression of social, ethical and religious beliefs of Limbu people. He writes in Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan (Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Narratives and Rituals) that Tongsing Mundhum is a quintessential collection of oral literature and ethnic narratives that have been transferred orally from the time immemorial to the Limbu people. This Mundhum is recited and narrated along with music of brass plates and drums by Limbu shamans known as Samba, Yeba, and Yema during the performances of Tongsing Takma ritual. It is believed that Tongsing Mundhum was originated long before the art of writing was introduced.\\nAccording to scholar Chaintanya Subba, various myths, legends, narratives and oracles have been incorporated in Tongsing Mundhum which guide the social, ethical and religious concepts and shape the attitude and behavior of the Limbus. It consists of the various myths related to the origin of universe, human beings, plants and animals, and birth of the concepts of incest, jealousy, curse etc. in human society and the remedies for different problems in the society.\\nLimbus believe that there have been substantial influences of the Tongsing Mundhum in the customs, ideologies, moral values and life rituals of the Limbu community. It has a distinct pragmatic and instructional value with regards to the construction and continuation of various social practices and belief system in the Limbu community. It has played a crucial role in imparting the message of social solidarity and cooperation. However, there remains an effectual task for us to explore the social dimensions of Tongsing Takma ritual impacting the social life and practices of Limbus in the past.\\nModernization has resulted into an irreversible loss of Limbu cultural heritages and ritual practices. A handful of enthusiasts of Limbu community are in disagreement themselves on which terminology best describes Limbu religion and cultural landscapes. Each group claims its own validity over the other but ironically overlooks the urgency of passing the knowledge to the coming generation. They don’t realize that culture and rituals live in society, not in institutions and books. If such cultural values can not be transferred to the coming generation, they would be the matter of history, to be searched in anthologies and museums. We certainly do not want that. So, rather than castigating others, we need to explore the nostrums to address the present challenges.\\nAs the majority of young generation are detached from such ritual practices, an irreparable cultural void is being created every day. Incipient danger is that present generation could be the last generation of Limbu community practicing and living with the distinct cultural practices and Mundhum-based life rituals. As remaining Phedangma, Samba, Yeba and Yuma have failed to transfer their knowledge to the young generation, it would be very hard to find their disciples practicing these rituals through the oral recitation of Mundhum after one or two decades. Don’t get me wrong. I don’t want this to happen either. But I have not seen any other possibility too until we carry the torch of responsibility to stand as bulwarks to protect and preserve our distinctive cultural traits before they are pushed into oblivion by the varieties of intrusions.\\nToday, Tongsing Takma and other rituals have become rare events in Limbu community due to two main reasons: first, very few Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema are left in the community who can perform them in a proper way and second, young generation have no inclination to follow these rituals as they are gradually losing interest in the past ideals. This is not simply the fault of young generation living under the overwhelming fluctuations of information and technology. We must take responsibility for not infusing them cultural consciousness and not persuading them to adopt these value systems in everyday life.\\nNowadays, a very few households are conducting Tongsing Takma and other rituals as a part of their daily lives mostly in remote villages. Some enthusiastic individuals and institutions are conducting this ritual in Kathmandu and other towns too. But such events largely become a simulacrum of the real Tongsing Takma, more as a frail attempt to recreate it and less as a distinct life rituals of the Limbu community. Such formalized occasions cannot persuade the heuristic value of these rituals to the coming generations.\\nThe only positive sign in this area is there have been some works in the transcribing the oral scriptures of Mundhum recited by those Limbu shamans. In recent days, some Limbu scholars and writers have transcribed Mundhum in Limbu and Nepali language and have documented those ritual performances. In this direction, the colossus work of Mundhum expert Bairagi Kaila is always commendable. He has collected and transcribed most of the Mundhum with the help of Limbu Phedangma, Samba, Yeba, and Yema. I personally feel indebted to his huge contribution to the Limbu community by preserving Limbu Mundhum.\\nYears ago, in the night of the Tongsing Takma ritual, my father used to recite Mundhum and its myths in a rhythmic tone from his infallible memory followed by rhythmic beating of his brass plate and harmonious shamanic dancing steps. In the morning, he would perform the ritual of Silam Sakma (blocking the path of death) for the whole family concerned by reciting the Mundhum as:\\nA bright place due to the moon above us\\nA bright place due to the sun above us\\nIn the place of life and age \\nAre life and age decreasing?\\nAre the bells of time and death ringing?\\nNow, without letting the death bell ring\\nI toss this incanted coin \\nTo block the path of the death.\\n(Excerpts translated from the Tongsing Takma Mundhum: Aakhyan Ra Anusthan by Bairagi Kaila)\\nWith these words, he would toss the coin in the name of each family member until the intended side of the coin overturned in the ground. The turning of the expected side of the coin is believed to have blocked the path of death, as a part of the ritual. I do not claim the efficacy of this ritual in the real time, but the psychological and mental asset of such rituals were certainly an important part of the community in past.\\nOnce ardent practitioner of Mundhum based rituals, my father would spend hours discussing about Mundhum and its various myths deciphering their meaning and implications to us. He adored Mundhum as a treasure for Limbu community that teaches us to live in harmony with nature. He used to say all natural entities be it rivers, hills, caves, forests, or anything that we get from nature, have to be worshiped and preserved because they support human life in one way or the other. He was not being philosophical at that time, neither had he had any idea of the subject but he was simply passing his impression of Mundhum for our generation. Today, I feel that humankind have already deferred the deadline to respect the nature, by exploiting its resources to the fullest extent and wreaking an unprecedented havoc in its beauty. And obviously, we are getting paid by the effects of global warming and other disastrous natural phenomena for our irresponsible action towards nature threatening the existence of life in the blue planet.\\nEven though we listened to his stories enthusiastically, my father could figure out that his listeners were losing interests in them. Then his remarks would be same as always - time has changed…in our time………and so on. At this moment, I can sense the meaning of his words but the time has changed for me too. But what I fear most is I even may not have the same words to convey to my children by referring to the nostalgia of our time. The indispensable cultural values that \\u200b\\u200bwe have inherited from our ancestors have been eroding with the passage of time. We are living in an age of cultural deviation and oblivion. Now, when I sit by my ailing father living in his early eighties, I sometimes envisage him as Truganini (1812 –1876) the last full blood Aboriginal Tasmanian, whose culture and identity were completely swept away by the wave of 19th century colonialism.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe Summer of 2005 was my first birthday and no guests visited. There was a cake and a toy.\\nThe toy was a helicopter with a broken wing that didn’t turn-on or chuff. I always wondered why it was like that.\\nAlso, to bear in mind, my parents emigrated from Nepal when I was seven months old. I was too small, too chubby, and too witless to contribute to their struggle except for the grins and the giggles that made it easier for them to move on with their days.\\nNot until sophomore year in high school did I learn how much my parents had struggled during the early years in the US. I also found the helicopter didn’t run, only because my parents couldn’t afford a toy during that time. So, they rummaged that broken chopper from someone else’s trash.\\nNonetheless, my intent in this narrative is not to inspire any sympathy. For me, this story is not as somber as it sounds. In fact, I got an opportunity to understand my parents’ struggle with a newfound humility. Their story and their sacrifice helped me get through a struggle, even if minor, was all my own.\\nSomewhere around the same time I was in high school, and nothing was going well. More importantly, I could not seem to get faster running cross-country. I had always loved running since early on, but at that point, the sport felt more like an obligation than a passion. I strove for motivation but failed to find one. At the heart of this disquietude, I knew the slip-up was only because without a clear plan, I just was not driven.\\nAs fate would have it, one morning in September of 2019, while I was struggling to run at the practice, Jaclyn, one of my faster running mates, asked me to run with her. I refused at first because I knew I couldn't keep up with her and yet, for some reason, I decided to plug away. That day, I called out on whatever was holding me back and I ran with her. I ran for myself and for my parents, and I ran to be the best version of my possibility.\\nThis gave me confidence and made me realize that I could accomplish what I thought was unimaginable. I realized my doubts and insecurities stemmed from my failure to push myself outside my comfort zone and that merely wanting something is not enough. I also had to act on it!\\nAfter that day, I proactively began creating a routine that I consistently followed. Just in a few weeks, I started seeing improvements.\\nAside from the track, I also got in touch with a few friends from Nepal and created a think tank named ‘The Connectors.’ The goal of this group was to support Nepal’s diplomacy with the other countries, especially its neighbors like India, China, and Bangladesh.\\nI became one of the senior captains in the Colleyville Heritage High School Cross-Country team. We qualified for the state three years consecutively and our team finished fourth among 5A Schools in Texas during the 2021 season. Meanwhile, I also frequently volunteer by visiting the middle school runners to motivate and encourage them.\\nI often think about that moment in my sophomore year where something snapped into the place, and I began to turn my life around. Some part of me believes that moment is defined by my friend’s lending hand while the other part is the inspiration from my parents' adversities.\\nNietzsche once said, 'A person with a Why can bear any How or What.'\\nThat forlorn summer morning, that dwindling moment of despair and gratitude, when those hapless hands picked that toy, that’s where I found my ‘Why’.\\nThe lowest moment my dad and my mom endured to give me a wisp of joy is now my highest moment to give them theirs back.\\n(Rijal is currently studying at Colleyville Heritage High School, Texas)\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nFor a very long time we have been hearing the government’s intention to regulate the over the top (OTT) and other services providing internet content in Nepal. Well, the wait is over as the government has recently come up with the amendment in the National Broadcasting Regulation 1995 (2052).\\nThe 11th amendment of the regulation has included OTT, video on demand (VOD), and internet television under 'Other Means of Communications'. With the said inclusion, the regulation now requires OTT and internet television to register to provide its service in Nepal. The term OTT has been defined as the service of displaying the programs as per the demand of the consumer through the internet without using the means of direct to home (DTH) cable or satellite and such term shall also include the media streaming services through other platforms by the means of internet. Further, internet television (Internet TV) has included the regular act of transmission of the self-produced audio-visual programs through the internet.\\nThis definition will require popular streaming service providers like YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. to obtain approval from the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology. The regulation has further provisioned for the mandatory requirement of the cache server within Nepal if the OTT service provider intends to make any member or customer in Nepal or acquire any kind of fees from Nepal. It has also required the storage of user information within the server of Nepal. Further, the OTT service providers should keep a record of the programs transmitted by them, for at least 60 days and the same shall also be made accessible to the ministry and other governmental authorities in the process of investigations.\\nThe content to be displayed through OTT must also be subject to categorization as per age. The “U” rating must be granted for such content which is appropriate to all the age groups whereas “A” rating is provided to the content for the age group above 18 years. “R” rating, similarly, provided to the content appropriate to the age group of 10-18 years.\\nThe regulation also provisions that the ministry can take control of such equipment or make necessary arrangements to disallow the operation of such equipment which has been used for transmission or communication of the program in an unauthorized manner without obtaining necessary license or approval as required by the regulation.\\nAs the regulation has mandatorily required approval of the ministry in order to distribute the content through the internet in Nepal, it is worth observing to see whether the foreign companies providing such services to the users based in Nepal comply. Due to the limited market of users in Nepal, it is less likely the service providers would be willing to register in Nepal as it may also trigger other compliance requirement as per the laws of Nepal. Further, it would be important to see what the government’s next step would be as the regulation is silent on the time period to comply with such requirements and what would it do to foreign OTT service providers if they fail to comply with the licensing requirement of the regulation.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI was first introduced to Panauti by John Sanday, the British conservation architect, who was in charge in the 1970s of the restoration of Hanuman Dhoka palace at the center of Kathmandu by UNESCO and has resided in the Nepali capital from that time on.\\nIt was in 1976. I was already familiar with Nepal and the Kathmandu Valley. I had been the cultural attaché at the French Embassy in 1970-71, and afterward spent nearly one year in the remote Newar village of Pyangaun in Lalitpur district, a village inhabited by Jyapu paddy-cultivators. These farmers were also at that time makers of bamboo boxes for measuring grains (rice, wheat), pyang in Nepal Bhasha. They used to exchange these boxes against food grains at several localities of the Kathmandu Valley in winter. Subsequently, I prepared and passed a PhD dissertation in the field of social anthropology (Paris University) on that village and joined the French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS), the main public organization for research in France, in 1975. I had learned local languages with students and teachers and was quite fluent at that time in Newari.\\nI remember very well my first time in Panauti with John Sanday. We were looking for a house to rent. The authorities of the locality guided us toward a Karmacharya family inhabiting in the lower part of the town, toward the sacred confluence of the Rosi and Punyamati rivers. The gharpatini, mistress of the house, and her daughter welcomed us. They offered us some food with very strong ayela (rice alcohol) and rented me a house nearby, with a very nice view of Indreshwar Mahadev temple and the Jangam math, the religious establishment where the priests of the Shaivite three-storied temple were inhabiting. The ground floor was used by a health post and a small vegetable garden was attached. It was an ideal place to work. It was decided that three young French architects would join me to undertake a full basic research work on Panauti. During our common period of fieldwork, we would focus on space and architecture. One of these architects, Vincent Barré, was already my friend. He came some years before to Pyangaun to help me draw a map of the village.\\nI moved to Panauti in the rainy season. I came on foot from Godavari with my cook and porter Sarkiman, crossing the range and descending on the other side of the mountain. We didn’t know the way exactly and got lost in the clouds. It was raining. We had to spend a night on the way in a Tamang house. We arrived at our destination the next morning. My three friends, who came by bus from Kathmandu the day before, were already there. We started the work immediately. Some inhabitants from Panauti joined us to draw a detailed map of the locality, which at that time didn’t exist. We set up three teams with local people for this topographical survey. It took us about 10 days to complete the preliminary job with double decameter ropes. All corners of the city were mapped. It must be said that from the very beginning Panauti inhabitants proved to be very friendly and cooperative with us. This assistance continued in all phases of the research. Perhaps they guessed that their locality would derive some benefits out of this research.\\nThis happened to be true: some years later, in the 1990s, the cultural branch of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs started renovating the main temples of the city, that were in a sorry condition, under the supervision of the Nepali Department of Archaeology. Several other projects focused on more secular matters, especially schools, platforms alongside the streets and an underground pipe system were also launched and implemented. In addition, some grants were allocated to the local youths in the field of technology. Robert Le Foll, a former member of the French Parliament, has been very active in this regard. Panauti became a symbol of French and Nepali cooperation.\\nThree persons from Panauti collaborated with us in a very important and fruitful manner: Ananta Madhikarmi, Chandeshwari Buddhacharya (Shakya), Shiva Jangam, who at the time was the priest of Indreshwar Mahadev temple, and Bisunath Tamrakar. I remember that I surveyed with Ananta Madhikarmi all the houses of the small city, collecting data on the population, as well as on economic data of every family, for instance the surface area (in ropani) of their paddy-fields whether privately owned or just labored as tenants. The French architects stayed for about three months in Panauti and went back to Paris where they were running a private architect enterprise. For my own part, I concentrated the following years almost entirely on Panauti city, its social and religious organization. My rented house was very convenient. I could invite some guests and friends from Kathmandu for lunch or for the weekend. It was also an appropriate place to work with my different local informants and offer them some tea. During the daytime, I used to spend time in the various tea stalls discussing with people on different subjects. And every night, I took a tour of the city along the river and within the market area. I made fantastic day trips with Ananta in the surrounding villages and religious places.\\nAltogether, I spent nearly one year on the spot, from 1977 till 1980. At the end, I offered a bhoj (a feast) to all the persons, Newars and Jangams mostly, who worked with me in the community. I had to sacrifice a goat to the nearby Ganesh on that occasion. Afterward, I presented my ethnographical materials in the Paris University in 1982 and obtained a second more elaborate PhD, after the first one obtained thanks to my study of Pyangaun. We call this superior type of Doctorate “Doctorat d’Etat” in French (this type of Doctorate disappeared from the university courses a little later). With the French architects, our common book written in French language was finally published in 1981 in Paris: Panauti, uneville au Népal (Panauti, a Town in Nepal). It is focused on history, social organization, use of space, domestic and religious architecture. A facsimile edition has been published recently in Kathmandu by Vajra Publications. Unfortunately, this book has not yet been translated in English or Nepali.\\nIn 1976, Panauti, a multi-caste locality, counted around 2,900 inhabitants, among which the vast majority were Newars (97%). It was a small historic city with an important market hub and a great number of pasals (shops) where the surrounding villagers could buy nearly all the items they needed. The market extension at the entrance of the locality, near the Maneshwari (Varahi) temple, already existed in its primary form. It developed dramatically in the following years, destabilizing the life of the small city and redirecting the market activities from the center to the periphery.\\nIn my views, the small town of Panauti can be analyzed through two main different paradigms: the mandalic (or cosmological) model and the socioeconomic change paradigm. I had already recently published a book with a number of photographs on the second aspect: Panauti: Past and present (1976-2020). Let me focus here on the mandalic structure.\\nAt first, the triangular shape of the city is clear. Panauti lies at the confluence of two rivers: the Punyamati to the north, and the Rosikhola to the south. The top of the triangle is pointed to the east. It is believed that a third river—subterranean, invisible river—supposedly flowing from the north under the Brahmayani three-storied temple, meets there. This third hidden river conveys a high sacral aura to the spot. The ritual place, called triveni (confluence of three rivers), is located at this junction and contains many religious monuments. This important religious confluence is visited by religious people every morning and evening. The inhabitants of the surrounding villages come there for cremation.\\nThis triveni confluence gives to Panauti the status of a famous pilgrimage site, known all over central Nepal and even in Northern India. Every 12 years, the Makar Mela (fair) is celebrated on that very place, in the solar month of Magh (January-February). On that occasion, thousands of pilgrims wash away their sins by bathing at the confluence of the three rivers. I described this festival in a long article published 10 years ago in a volume called Sin and Sinners (Brill, 2012). According to the inhabitants, the city has a form of a fish. The main temple of Indreshwar Mahadev, originally built in the 13th century by a Newar princess named Birma Devi and run by Jangam (Lingayat) priests, is related to this religious confluence. The outer impressive struts, which decorate the religious monument with eminent figures of Hindu mythology, are a testimony of the antiquity of the temple. In 1977, we asked the children of Panauti to draw a map of their city, as they imagined. All represented their locality in a triangular form, the triveni oriented upward, to the north, giving to the city the form of a mountain (except one who placed the apex of the triangle downward).\\nYet, this structure is not enough to understand the city. In the 1970s, the urban zone of Panauti was still clearly separated from the outside by an outer circle of eight goddesses’ temples, dedicated to the Ashta (eight) Matrika of the Hindu-Buddhist Tantric tradition. A specific direction in space corresponds to each of these goddesses. They protect the city against diseases and evil spirits and are regularly worshipped on specific days of the lunar calendar. The temple of Brahmayani, is the most important of these religious monuments. It faces the confluence of the rivers, on the opposite bank of the city.\\nThis outer religious ring is centered on a large esplanade located at the epicenter of the old city, which is called layku, royal palace, by the local people. Located nearby, a small altar is dedicated to the ancient divinity and guardian deity of the Newar Malla kings, the Taleju goddess. Offerings are made there every year, during Dashain festival (mostly in October). This zone is presently under archaeological investigation by the Nepali Department of Archaeology. As a matter of fact, during a temporary period of the medieval age, Panauti had been the seat of a small independent or semi-independent kingdom/principality. In addition, as all Newar settlements, Panauti is divided between an upper part (thane) and a lower part, (kwane) according to the direction for the nearby river. This division passes through the “royal” center of the city.\\nThis geometrical spatial structure, a center surrounded by eight temples supposedly located in the eight directions of the universe, gives to Panauti the form of a mandala religious diagram, a micro-representation of the universe. The Karmacharyas who are presently the Tantric priests of these goddesses’ sanctuaries, still have a clear vision of this cosmic configuration. It was applied to Panauti during the Malla medieval time to convey to the locality a royal status and to give her a prestigious microcosmic image of the universe. In this regard, Panauti can be considered as a reduced form of the neighboring larger Hindu city of Bhaktapur, where the German researchers (Kölver and Gutschow) have uncovered a similar layout, associated with identical religious representations. As I showed in my research works, the mandalic structure of the city still dominates the religious life of Panauti and comes in full light during the main religious festival celebrated there, particularly during Dashain celebrations and the main jatra (festival, procession) of the city, in the month of May, just before the rainy season: the Jyaa Punhi festival.\\n(The author is Emeritus Research Director at CNRS)\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nI want to preface this blog by clarifying that what I am positing here is not an attack on anybody’s personal integrity but an attempt to reveal a tendency, perhaps all too human, that often underpins our political biases and colors our vision in such a way that we lose sight of the future.\\nThe political bias I am going to describe here is something that I prefer to call as “the bias of the present,” or, in other words, the tendency to view current political climate as though it is going to continue as it is forever in the future. Adam Gopnik, a popular writer for the US-based magazine, “The New Yorker,” calls it “presentism,” which he defines as, “an assumption that what is happening now is going to keep on happening, without anything happening to stop it.” I prefer to use the word “bias” because of the unreasonable prejudice attached to this kind of thinking.\\nThis kind of bias in thinking is now famously attributed to Francis Fukuyama, the renowned political thinker, who, at one time, declared that the world had come to an “end of history” with liberal capitalist democracies being the climactic endpoint. Fukuyama, who is still pilloried for his rather Panglossian view, argued that countries all over the world were becoming more freer, more liberal, more tolerant, and getting closer and closer to a utopia very similar to the liberal democracies in the West. Fukuyama’s grand utterances are seen today as a cautionary—and an instructive—moment for public intellectuals who are inclined to make sweeping claims about the future by simply looking at the current trends.\\nSadly, the current Bibeksheel Sajha Party (BSP), which was supposed to represent the optimism of the youths in the country, seems to be doing a Fukuyama in reverse. Rabindra Mishra and his like-minded coterie in the current BSP formed after the recent purges, are engaged in an overly pessimistic portrayal of present Nepal and have accordingly projected a pessimistic future for the country as though the situation can only get worse from here. Under Mishra, the current BSP apparatus seems almost eager to see the current situation spiral out of control so that their egos will be satisfied, and their recently espoused political lines, vindicated. But in so doing, Mishra and the BSP have not only led the movement of the youths astray but have also muddled the public perception by overestimating their own power while underestimating the fundamental feature of a democracy, namely its auto-correctional tendencies.\\nIn the past BSP was popular among the youths because the party embodied the hopes and optimism that can only spring from the resourceful idealism and energy of the young people. No one expected BSP to form a viable alternative to the prevailing political parties, but everyone took pleasure from the fact that the youths were raising the consciousness of the public by demanding accountability from public officials and showing a new possibility for the future. Alongside the civil society, BSP stood at a sweet spot (call it the Goldilocks of Nepali politics), just outside the fray of everyday politics, but also within it in such a way that it could act both as a party, demanding accountability and good governance, but also as an idealisticentity that projected an optimistic and much-needed normative framework for the future of the country’s politics. The party was extremely successful given its limited reach and resources. The demonstrations against Nepal Banda, in particular, became a huge success while the party also gained enormous support in its fight against government corruption and incompetency, especially in the demonstrations against increasing instances of rapes and sexual assaults around the country.\\nThe party was doing exactly what it was supposed to do until Mishra woke up one morning and blindsided his own party members—who had sacrificed their youthful energy, time, and resources—by highjacking the party and free riding on its goodwill. An idealistic party that represented hope for the future was overnight turned into an in-group that delighted in the same muck that it was supposed to transcend.\\nNow, there is no doubt that Rabindra Mishra is a gentleman who is genuinely worried about the current state of affairs in the country. In fact, as someone who is extremely self-aware of his public persona, Mishra, in my opinion, is willing to maintain a level of honesty and transparency that has not yet been seen from any of our leaders. There is no doubt in his honest endeavors. However, a nice coiffeur and a bright persona can only take you so far when the political line you have chosen depends on painting a dark picture. Mishra has, either wittingly or unwittingly, narrowed the imagination of the youths in the country by taking their movement to a dead end. He has done a great disservice by putting his ego before the ethos of the youths.\\nMost importantly though, Mishra and the current BSP are omitting a fundamental difference between the current political system—however flawed—that we have versus the system that they are advocating for: the system that we currently have has an inbuilt feature that will slowly but effectively autocorrect its mistakes, while the system that the current BSP is advocating for has an inbuilt bug that will only rear its ugly head again and again.\\nLike many others, I looked at BSP as a party of youths who were not beholden to any established political power. Despite its limited clout, the party was able to transcend the filth of Nepali politics and demand accountability by galvanizing the youths who brought new energy, vision, and optimism to an otherwise ossified party culture in Nepal. Just as the Nepali people were only beginning to believe and share the idealism of the youths, the bias of the present took over BSP and brought the project to a screeching halt.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAs someone steeped in liberal values it certainly feels odd and slightly uneasy to defend a leader who carried—or perhaps still carries—a huge baggage of totalitarian ideology that is antithetical to my own political beliefs. Despite the deep-seated cognitive dissonance, however, I am making a pitch for a liberal Prachanda not because I condone his actions as a supremo of the armed uprising, but because I think his political survival is necessary for a progressive and forward-looking Nepal that is focused on the principles of individual rights and dignity. Despite his personal and political flaws, which he himself has openly acknowledged on several occasions—a rare instance among Nepali politicians or any politicians for that matter—I believe that Prachanda has been a force who has championed the liberal cause in Nepal. At a time when zealotry is rearing its head and the moderates are hobbled by their own incompetency and lack of leadership, Prachanda’s political survival has become indispensable to prevent the country from sliding backwards from its social and political gains.\\nEven as the country continues to wobble under the weight of egotistical power jockeying of a few politicians (including Prachanda), there has in fact been some significant progress in matters of individual rights, minority rights and their access to justice in the past few years. For all its destruction, any reasonable person who is not driven by personal agendas, will agree that the Maoist Revolution empowered the section of the population that had heretofore been relegated to live as second-class citizens. It is safe to say that the Maoist uprising threw away the yoke of arbitrary customs and traditions that had kept the minorities in positions of permanent subservience and has compelled the hitherto Kathmandu-centric governments to pay attention to broader Nepal, beyond the metropolis. To be sure, the Maoists opened the floodgates for both the good and the bad, and there is no doubt that Prachanda’s earlier misgivings toward the multiparty democratic system weakened both his political standing as well as people’s trust in the newly established system. Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the progressive political achievements are now under attack as some political opportunists try to roll back the clock by undermining every liberal value—from secularism to constitutionalism to republicanism.\\nIt is in this context I believe that Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda more than ever. Not the self-serving Prachanda confined to his doctrinal ideology who is always on the lookout for opportunities to burnish his personal image, but a Prachanda who speaks to and champions the needs of the poor, the marginalized and the vulnerable. Nepal needs a Prachanda who consistently keeps the interest of the vulnerable and the marginalized at the front and center of his politics and is guided by a moral imperative to do good for those who have been wronged in the name of caste, creed, geography, or economic status. Nepal needs a liberal Prachanda who doesn’t engage in an unwarranted nationalistic jingoism, who doesn’t make over-the-top ridiculous claims, who doesn’t engage in short-sighted tactical power brokerage, but a Prachanda who is less a politician than a moral character who transcends—or at least tries to transcend—partisan politics. Nepal needs a Prachanda who isn’t afraid to lose elections, but nevertheless finds ways to champion the causes of the less privileged. Nepal needs a Prachanda who is chastised by his past mistakes, who isn’t hungry for power, who is ready to forgo the limelight, and who understands that he doesn’t always have to be at the center of power and politics to do good.\\nPerhaps I might be asking too much from Prachanda, for how can Prachanda live without being Prachanda, a leader who shot to power by brute force of the gun? How can the man, the rebel, and the commander abandon his core ideology that revolves around power grabbing and gaining control of the state? The road ahead may be difficult, but it is doable. The name Prachanda now needs a complete makeover as does the character behind the name. Prachanda needs to start a revolution once again, but this time the revolution should be internal, within himself, and the guiding principles of that revolution should be morality, equality, and justice. Nepal doesn’t necessarily need a Prachanda in power, but it needs the voice of a liberal Prachanda who can lead a moral revolution toward an open, tolerant, kind, and just Nepal.\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nMenstruation is a part of the reproductive cycle; it is as natural as any secretion that your body discharges. It is a monthly reality for billions of women and girls around the globe. A natural biological process, which should dignify women and girls, has become a subject of shame due to taboos and myths that exclude women from many aspects of socio-cultural life. Despite the advancement in societal understanding, identifying menstruation as ‘impure’ is still deeply embedded in religion, cultural belongings, and societal practices.\\nNepali society is also prey to the regressive mindset and social practice regarding menstruation. The taboo of vaginal discharge has put women at the back in society all through ages. From religious texts like Swasthanikatha, to story of Rishi Panchami all exemplify how menstruation is a sin and how women are victims of this natural process. The story of Rishi Panchami follows a woman named Sushila who entered the kitchen while menstruating during her past life. This was her biggest sin, and due to which she was reborn as a dog to be treated like one. Her husband in return is also reincarnated as a bull carrying the sin of his wife. The heartrending part is, we as Hindus glorify these myths and perform a yearly ritual on Rishi Panchami just to wash our sin of menstruating away. When we hear these myths we wonder, if goddesses Parvati, Laxmi, Saraswoti, Kali, Durga ever menstruated? If they did, how come they are prayed throughout the year, even during that time of the month?\\nNepali societies in the past have exaggerated the myth surrounding menstruation and have twisted their own product of what menstruation shall actually be. Followed by a lot of don’ts: don’t sit there, don’t touch that, don’t enter the kitchen, don’t touch water source, don’t sleep in the bed, don’t wear the same clothes, don’t stay in the home and whole bunch of don’ts follows. Such taboos about menstruation present in many societies impact girls’ and women\\'s emotional state, mentality and lifestyle, and most importantly, health. A lot of these superstitions are behavioral restrictions that, aside from being untrue, contribute to gender-based discrimination. Every adolescent girl has to miss her school and every woman has to sacrifice social functions, festivals, and daily life only because she is born to be the carrier of life. These “don’ts” have taken the lives of many women, in the form of Chhau (shed for menstruating women) or unhealthy menstruating practices. Yet, we claim that women are treated as equal in our society. How unfortunate!\\nThe mentality of impure and untouchable has transcended from rural villages to posh educated families of suburban and urban cities of Nepal. It’s an embarrassment that highly educated families like ours are still practicing this taboo inflicted by our regressive society. Despite being a woman of modern thoughts and ideologies, we are chained by these ‘don’ts’ just because we are too vulnerable to hurt the religious sentiments of our parents and the regressive society which means everything to them.\\xa0\\nDespite the government\\'s efforts on criminalizing any kind of discriminatory behavior during menstruation, and demolishing menstrual huts in Achham, Surkhet, Dailekh, Bajhang, Salyan and other districts, the practice is still present loud and proud in every household of the country. The poignant part is that everyone is getting so used to this practice that it is not seen as discrimination. Society is evolving, people are adapting to all sorts of technologies and innovations, they are challenging their way of life yet their mindset is static and changing that has been a slow burn.\"Everyone wants change, but no one wants to change\". The challenge, of addressing the socio-cultural taboos and beliefs in menstruation, is compounded by the lack of knowledge and understanding of puberty, menstruation, and reproductive health. Thus, there is a need to follow a strategic approach to combat these issues.\\nThe solution to all this is simple and can be covered by one word “MINDSET”. Unless we change our mindset and grow out of the religious stigma, this practice is going nowhere. Rather than taking it as a shame, it’s about time we celebrated it as the greatest gift of human life. We all were born because there was someone menstruating; it’s a celebration of life, celebration of womanhood, and celebration of women power. Rather than being whispered in ears and wrapped in newspapers, it shall be a normal day act. Just think about it, men secrete sperms every single day, we do not consider them untouchables. Women do the same thing once a month and there is all the fuss about that.\\xa0 To change the mindset and outlook at this boon (currently misunderstood as sin), there is still a long way to go and the journey starts with you.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPresident Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.\\nXi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.\\nMeanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.\\nThe Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.\\r\\n“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”\\nThe tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.\\nTaiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.\\nA Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”\\nXi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.\\n“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.\\nThe statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.\\nCoverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.\\nPelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.\\nBeijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.\\nSince then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.\\nThe conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.\\nXi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad.

       "  '\\nPresident Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.\\nXi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.\\nMeanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further. Xi has been invited to Indonesia in November for a meeting of the Group of 20 major economies, making it a potential location for a face-to-face meeting.\\nThe Chinese government gave no indication Xi and Biden discussed possible plans by U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to visit Taiwan, which the ruling Communist Party says has no right to conduct foreign relations. But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.\\r\\n“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”\\nThe tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.\\nTaiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.\\nA Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”\\nXi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country. The United States, by contrast, has a “one-China policy” that says Washington takes no position on the question but wants to see it resolved peacefully.\\n“Both sides of the Taiwan Strait belong to one and the same China,” the statement said.\\nThe statement cited Biden as saying the United States doesn’t support independence for Taiwan.\\nCoverage of the conversation in China’s entirely state-controlled media on Friday was limited to repeating government statements.\\nPelosi has yet to confirm whether she will go to Taiwan, but if she does, the Democrat from California would be the highest-ranking elected American official to visit since then-Speaker Newt Gingrich in 1997.\\nBeijing criticized Gingrich for saying the United States would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese attack but did little else in response to his three-hour visit to the island.\\nSince then, China’s position on Taiwan has hardened as the mainland economy grew to become second-largest after the United States. The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.\\nThe conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.\\nXi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.\\nThe United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.\\nXi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.\\nHe also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.\\nBusinesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk.

       "  '\\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron’s unpopular plan to raise France’s retirement age from 62 to 64 was enacted into law Saturday, the day after the country’s constitutional body approved the change.\\nMacron’s signature and publication in the Official Journal of the French Republic allowed the law to enter into force. The authorized changes will start being implemented in September, French government spokesperson Olivier Veran said.\\nOn Friday, the Constitutional Council rejected some parts of the government’s pension legislation but approved the higher minimum retirement age, which was central to Macron’s plan and the focus of opponents’ protests.\\nThe nine-member council’s decision capped months of tumultuous debates in parliament and fervor in the streets. Spontaneous demonstrations took place in Paris and across the country after the ruling.\\nFrance’s main labor unions, which organized 12 nationwide protests since January in hopes of defeating the plan, have vowed to continue fighting until it is withdrawn. They called for another mass protest on May 1, which is International Workers’ Day.\\nThe government argued that requiring people to work two years more before qualifying for a pension was needed to keep the pension system afloat as the population ages; opponents proposed raising taxes on the wealthy or employers instead, and said the change threatened a hard-won social safety net.\\nOpinion polls show Macron’s popularity has plunged to its lowest level in four years. The centrist president, who made raising the retirement age a priority of his second term, plans to make a televised national address on Monday evening, Macron’s office said.\\n“The president’s remarks are very much awaited” and will both seek to appease tensions in the country and explain decisions that have been made in the past months regarding the pension reform, government spokesperson Veran said.\\nMacron was first elected in 2017 on a promise to make France’s economy more competitive, including by making people work longer.\\nSince then, his government has made it easier to hire and fire workers, cut business taxes and made it more difficult for the unemployed to claim benefits.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe death toll from Russian missile strikes on eastern Ukraine’s city of Sloviansk rose to 11 Saturday as rescue crews tried to reach people trapped in the rubble of an apartment building, Ukrainian authorities said.\\nUkraine’s air force said the country would soon have weapons with which to try to prevent attacks like the one on Friday. The delivery of the Patriot air defense system promised by the U.S. was expected in Ukraine sometime after Easter, Ukrainian air force spokesperson Yuriy Ihnat said.\\nThe primarily Orthodox Christian country is preparing to observe Easter on Sunday. Speaking Saturday on Ukrainian state TV, Ihnat declined to give a precise timeline for the arrival of the defensive missile system but said the public would know “as soon as the first Russian aircraft is shot down.”\\nA group of 65 Ukrainian soldiers completed their training last month at Fort Sill, a U.S. Army post in Oklahoma, and returned to Europe to learn more about using the defensive missile system to track and shoot down enemy aircraft.\\nOfficials said at the time that the Ukrainians would then go back to their country with a Patriot missile battery, which typically includes six mobile launchers, a mobile radar, a power generator and an engagement control center.\\nGermany and the Netherlands also have pledged to provide a Patriot system each to Ukraine. In addition, a SAMP/T anti-missile system pledged by France and Italy “should enter Ukraine in the near future,” Ihnat said this week.\\nThe Ukrainian military is looking to beef up its ability to intercept missiles as it prepares for an expected spring counter-offensive to retake Russian-occupied areas of the country. Although more than a year of fighting has depleted weapons supplies on both sides, Russian forces have intensified their 8 1/2-month campaign to seize the city of Bakhmut, the focus of the war’s longest battle so far.\\nBakhmut and Sloviansk are located about 45 kilometers (28 miles) apart in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk province.\\nRescue teams in Sloviansk recovered the bodies of two people from under the rubble of a house hit in Friday’s missile strikes, according to the State Emergency Service. They also searched Saturday for five people who remained in the wreckage of the apartment building, as well as the residents of three units who were reported missing, Vadym Liakh, the head of the local government, said.\\nSeparately, a 48-year-old woman and her 28-year-old daughter died Saturday after Russian forces shelled a neighborhood of the city of Kherson, the regional administration said on Telegram. The southern port city was occupied by Russian forces in the early months of the war, but Ukrainian forces regained control of it in November, one of the most notable battlefield defeats for Moscow.\\nA new law signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that allows military offices to send draft notices electronically instead of delivering them in person is part of Russia’s preparation for a protracted war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry said in a Saturday morning assessment.\\nAccording to British intelligence, a “unified registry of individuals eligible for military service” will be digitally linked to other government services, allowing Russian authorities to “punish draft-dodgers by automatically limiting employment rights and restricting foreign travel.”\\nSince the law does not come into force until later in the year, the U.K. Defense Ministry said the e-notices do not automatically point to a “major new wave of enforced mobilization” but rather form part of a “longer-term approach to provide personnel as Russia anticipates a lengthy conflict in Ukraine.”\\nMeanwhile, 52,000 young Russian men already have received draft orders as part of the country’s regular spring call-up, and 21,000 of them qualified for military service, Col. Andrey Biryukov, who is in charge of mobilization, said Saturday.\\nBiryukov addressed concerns that the new electronic conscription law presaged a broader mobilization of reservists, like one Putin ordered in September.\\n“I’d like to stress that all army deferrals for citizens will still be valid. And e-draft orders will not be mailed in bulk,” Biryukov said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUkraine’s foreign minister said Thursday his country won’t budge from its demand that Russia withdraw its forces from Crimea, as well as from other parts of Ukraine that Moscow illegally annexed more recently, for the war to end.\\nCalling the conflict in Ukraine “a bleeding wound in the middle of Europe,” Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said all his country’s territory must be treated equally in dealing with the Kremlin after its full-scale invasion more than 13 months ago.\\n“We are united by U.N. charter principles and the shared conviction that Crimea is Ukraine and it will return under Ukraine’s control,” Kuleba said, speaking by video link to a gathering in the Romanian capital, Bucharest.\\n“Every time you hear anyone from any corner of the world saying that Crimea is somehow special and should not be returned to Ukraine, as any other part of our territory, you have to know one thing: Ukraine categorically disagrees with these statements,” he said at the Black Sea Security Conference.\\nRussia took over Crimea in 2014, and during the current war has expanded its presence there. Occasional acts of sabotage and other attacks against Russian military and other facilities on the peninsula have occurred since, with the Kremlin blaming Ukraine. The Kyiv government hasn’t claimed responsibility for the attacks but welcomes efforts to repel the Russian presence there.\\nThe Kremlin wants Kyiv to acknowledge Russia’s sovereignty over Crimea and also recognize September’s annexation of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia.\\nUkraine has rejected those demands and won’t hold talks with Russia until Moscow’s troops pull back from all occupied territories.\\nThough there is no sign of possible peace negotiations, the two countries have sporadically exchanged prisoners of war and have engaged in a wartime deal for the export of Ukrainian grain and Russian grain and fertilizers. The grain deal has helped ease concerns about the global food supply, especially to countries in Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where many are already struggling with hunger.\\nThe agreement, which the U.N. and Turkey brokered last July, is delicate, however, and Moscow has repeatedly threatened to end it.\\nIn the latest dispute, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Thursday that no discussion about extending the Black Sea grain deal beyond May 18 would take place until progress was made towards resolving what it called “five systemic problems” that have resulted from sanctions on Russia over the war.\\nIt said in a statement those issues were: reconnecting the state-owned Russian Agricultural Bank to the SWIFT international banking system; resuming supplies to Russia of agricultural machinery, spare parts and services; lifting restrictions on insurance and reinsurance and the ban on access to ports; restoring the operation of the Tolyatti-Odesa ammonia pipeline; and unblocking foreign assets and accounts of Russian companies related to the production and transportation of food and fertilizers.\\nRussia agreed last month to extend the grain deal for 60 days — instead of the 120 days set under a previous extension — to send a warning to the West.\\nOn the battlefield, military analysts say, an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in coming months could aim at the land corridor between Russia and Crimea, hoping to split Russia’s forces in two.\\nThat would be a daunting military challenge. Satellite images show the Kremlin’s forces are digging extensive trench systems between mainland Ukraine and the Black Sea peninsula.\\nThe fighting in recent months has become a war of attrition, with neither side able to gain momentum over the winter and often resorting to long-range bombardment.\\nAt least four civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in the latest Russian barrages that continued to hit civilian infrastructure, Ukraine’s presidential office said Thursday.\\nThe Ukrainian military said Russian forces over the previous 24 hours launched 32 airstrikes, two missile strikes and 40 attacks from multiple rocket launchers.\\nIn other developments:\\n— Russia’s Prosecutor General’s Office has opened an investigation into a video appearing to show the beheading of a Ukrainian serviceman that appeared online this week, according to the government department’s press service. It said it intended “to assess the reliability of these materials.” Ukraine on Wednesday also launched an investigation into what it alleged was the latest atrocity blamed on Russia since it invaded in February 2022.\\n— A Russian mine exploded near a generator room at one of the reactors of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Ukraine’s state nuclear operator Energoatom said. “Russian occupiers continue to turn the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant into a military base, mining the perimeter,” Energoatom wrote on Telegram. The head of the U.N.’s atomic energy agency confirmed the landmine explosion and reported one had also occurred last Saturday. Rafael Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency said: “At a time of growing speculation about military offensives and counteroffensives in the region, it is more important than ever to agree that a nuclear power plant should never be attacked, nor used to launch attacks from. I will not rest until this has been achieved.”\\nEurope’s largest nuclear plant has six reactors, all of which have been shut down over the past year. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has been trying for months to obtain agreement between Ukraine and Russia on securing the plant, whose reactors and other equipment still require an external electricity supply to operate safety systems.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFormer US President Donald Trump answered questions for nearly seven hours Thursday during his second deposition in a legal battle with New York’s attorney general over his company’s business practices, reversing an earlier decision to invoke his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination and remain silent.\\nThe Republican met all day with lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James, who sued Trump last year. Her lawsuit claims Trump and his family misled banks and business associates by giving them false information about his net worth and the value of assets such as hotels and golf courses.\\nShortly after Trump entered the Manhattan skyscraper that houses James’ offices, his attorney, Alina Habba, said he was “not only willing but also eager to testify.”\\nAfter the deposition was finished, a lawyer for Trump’s businesses, Christopher Kise, said the former president had spent nearly seven hours “describing in detail his extraordinary business success.”\\n“The transactions at the center of this case were wildly profitable for the banks and for the Trump entities,” Kise said. “When the facts of this success, and not politically engineered soundbites, are out in the open, everyone will scoff at the notion any fraud took place.”\\nThe lawsuit is unrelated to the felony criminal charges filed against Trump by the Manhattan district attorney, which led last week to his historic arraignment, the first for a former president.\\nJames declined to answer a question about the deposition at a news conference on an unrelated matter Wednesday.\\nTrump previously met with James’ lawyers Aug. 10, but refused to answer all but a few procedural questions, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights more than 400 times. At the time, James had not yet brought her lawsuit and it was unclear whether questions about the way Trump valued his company would become the basis of a criminal case.\\n“Anyone in my position not taking the Fifth Amendment would be a fool, an absolute fool,” he said in that deposition, which was recorded on video and later released publicly. Trump predicted a “renegade” prosecutor would try to make a criminal case out of his answers, if he gave them.\\n“One statement or answer that is ever so slightly off, just ever so slightly, by accident, by mistake, such as it was a sunny, beautiful day, when actually it was slightly overcast, would be met by law enforcement at a level seldom seen in this country, because I’ve experienced it,” he said.\\nCircumstances since then have changed. The criminal charges brought by the Manhattan district attorney focused on how the company accounted internally for payments to a lawyer, Michael Cohen, for his work paying off people not to go public with stories about extramarital sexual encounters Trump said never happened.\\nJames’ lawsuit focused on allegations that Trump lied repeatedly about his own wealth and exaggerated the value of his assets on financial statements.\\nIn a social media post Thursday morning, Trump called the suit “ridiculous, just like all of the other Election Interference cases being brought against me.”\\nHe raised a fist as he left his apartment at Trump Tower in the morning, arriving by motorcade at the attorney general’s office around 9:40. The two sides took a break for lunch. Trump departed in the motorcade just before 6:15 p.m. and did not stop to speak to reporters.\\nThe lawsuit James brought is scheduled to go to trial in October. Video recordings of Trump’s depositions could potentially be played at the trial, if the lawsuit is not settled.\\nThursday’s deposition was conducted in private.\\n',\n",

The April 26 summit with President Joe Biden is seen as crucial to winning a stronger U.S. security commitment and resolving grievances over the Biden administration’s economic and technology policies.\\nThe leaked documents were posted online as part of a major U.S. intelligence breach. The papers viewed by The Associated Press indicate that South Korea’s National Security Council “grappled” with the U.S. in early March over an American request to provide artillery ammunition to Ukraine.\\nThe documents, which cited a signals intelligence report, said then-NSC Director Kim Sung-han suggested the possibility of selling the 330,000 rounds of 155 mm munitions to Poland, since getting the ammunition to Ukraine quickly was the United States’ ultimate goal.\\nSouth Korea, a growing arms exporter, has a policy of not supplying weapons to countries at war. It has not provided arms directly to Ukraine, although it has shipped humanitarian aid and joined U.S.-led economic sanctions against Russia.\\nYoon’s government said it discussed the leaked papers with the United States, and they agreed that “a considerable number” of the documents were fabricated. The South Korean government avoided any public complaints about the U.S. and did not specify which documents were faked.\\n“There’s no indication that the U.S., which is our ally, conducted (eavesdropping) on us with malicious intent,” Kim Tae-hyo, Seoul’s deputy national security director, told reporters Tuesday at Dulles Airport near Washington at the start of a trip aimed at preparing for the summit.\\nSenior Biden administration have discussed the leaks with allies at high levels and sought to reassure them of the U.S. government’s commitment to safe-guarding intelligence. The administration also sought to downplay the impact the leak would have on Yoon’s upcoming visit.\\n“Our commitment to the Republic of Korea remains ironclad, and President Biden looks forward to welcoming President Yoon to the White House for the upcoming state visit to discuss their shared commitment for a strong and deeply integrated U.S.-ROK Alliance that maintains peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific and beyond,” the White House National Security Council said in a statement, using South Korea’s official name.\\nThe Yoon government’s stance invited criticism from liberal rivals, who called on the government to lodge strong protests with the U.S. They also suspected what they call Yoon’s hasty relocation of his presidential office to a Defense Ministry compound in central Seoul may have left the office vulnerable to wiretapping.\\n“As a sovereign nation, we must sternly respond to the spying of state secrets, even if it was committed by an ally with whom (South Korea) has bonded over blood,” said Park Hong-geun, floor leader of the main liberal opposition Democratic Party.\\nIn an official statement, Yoon’s office said it maintains tight security, including anti-eavesdropping systems. It called the opposition party’s attempts to link the office relocation to the spying allegation “diplomatic suicidal acts” that shake South Korea’s national interests and its alliance with the U.S.\\nThe situation is unlikely to threaten the country’s alliance with the U.S. that was forged during the 1950-53 Korean War, many experts say.\\n“No big damage is expected on the Korea-U.S. alliance as it seems both governments share the view that they would focus on the alliance, more concretely on a successful state visit by Yoon,” said Bong Young-shik, an expert at Seoul’s Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies.\\nIf Yoon returns with some achievements, Koreans will conclude that he put up with the spying allegations “because bigger matters were at stake,” Bong said. But if the visit amounts to ”a pomp-only trip,” people could question whether South Korea “made lots of concessions.”\\nOne possible achievement for Yoon would be if South Korea takes on a role in the management of U.S. nuclear weapons in the face of North Korea’s advancing nuclear arsenal.\\nOther wins would be securing U.S. benefits for major South Korean businesses involved in the making of electric vehicles and easing U.S. restrictions on technology exports to China, which has been a major manufacturing base for South Korean chipmakers.\\nIf the U.S. intends to help Yoon, “the latest incident on the documents could end up strengthening the Korea-U.S. alliance and helping South Korea win something from the U.S,” said Kim Yeol Soo, an expert at South Korea’s Korea Institute for Military Affairs.\\nKim Tae-hyung, a professor at Seoul’s Soongsil University, said the exposure of possible U.S. spying could help Seoul maintain its existing policy of not supplying weapons to Ukraine. But it’s also possible that the Yoon government reconsiders that policy now that the U.S. demands are public, Kim said.\\nSince Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea has agreed to provide billions of dollars’ worth of tanks, howitzers, fighter jets and other weapons to Poland, a NATO member.\\nAn American official said in November that the United States had agreed to buy 100,000 artillery rounds from South Korean manufacturers to provide to Ukraine, although South Korean officials have maintained that the munitions were meant to refill depleted U.S. stocks.\\nChoi Jin, director of the Seoul-based Institute of Presidential Leadership, said it’s also no secret that allies spy on each other, as well as their adversaries.\\nThe U.S. wiretapping activities “are something that everyone already knows,” although it becomes a more sensitive matter when the practice is made public, Choi said.\\n“I think South Koreans also try to wiretap (U.S. officials) as well,” Choi said. “People feel animosity toward the word ‘wiretapping.’ But in other words, it’s called intelligence gathering.”\\n',\n",

A nearly identical statement from the Sussex’s representatives confirmed the news.\\nThe May 6 date of the coronation at Westminster Abbey coincides with their son’s birthday.\\nWhile the announcement should silence the “will he or won’t he” debate in the British media, it won’t end the royal soap opera swirling around Harry and Meghan as King Charles III prepares for his coronation.\\nWhen the prince attended the funerals of his grandfather, Prince Philip, and his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, commentators discussed everything from whether Harry would be allowed to wear his military uniform to exactly where he was seated. And there is always the question of whether he will meet face-to-face with his father and older brother, Prince William.\\nThat intrigue will only be heightened after Harry and Meghan stoked their critique of the royal family in a six-part Netflix series about their decision to step back from royal duties three years ago, which was followed by Harry’s decision to reveal family secrets in his bestselling memoir “Spare.”\\nHarry and Meghan, who is biracial, have alleged she faced racist attitudes from both the palace and the U.K. press. The treatment contributed to their decision to leave the country.\\nThe revelations in “Spare,″ including details of private conversations with his father and brother, Prince William, fanned tensions between Harry and his family that became public when he and his wife moved to North America in 2020.\\nThe book also included allegations that members of the royal family regularly feed the press unflattering information about other members of the House of Windsor in exchange for positive coverage of themselves.\\nThe prince singled out Camilla, the queen consort, accusing her of leaking private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate her image after marrying Charles. Camilla was once reviled for her long-term affair with Charles, which contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to the late Princess Diana, Harry and William’s mother.\\nThe acrimony between Harry and his family once again spilled into public view last month when the Sussexes said that they had been asked to vacate their home in Britain.\\nFrogmore Cottage, a royal residence on the grounds of Windsor Castle west of London, was the couple’s main residence before they gave up royal duties and moved to Montecito, a wealthy enclave in Southern California.\\n',\n",

Instead, New Delhi has stressed the need for diplomacy and dialogue on ending the war and has expressed its willingness to contribute to peace efforts.\\nDzhaparova said she hopes Indian officials including National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, who visited Moscow in February and held talks with President Vladimir Putin, will also visit Kyiv.\\n“We would be happy to welcome Indian officials to Kyiv,” she said.\\nRussian officials are expected to visit India in coming weeks for meetings of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, which the country is chairing this year.\\nIndia depends on Russia for nearly 60% of its defense equipment and has ramped up its purchases of low-priced Russian oil since the war in Ukraine began.\\nOn Monday, Dzhaparova warned India against an over reliance on Russia.\\n“India should be pragmatic in diversifying its energy resources, military contracts and political interactions. Because what we see in my country when you are dependent on Russia, they will always use this blackmail instrument,” she told reporters.\\nIndia also holds the rotating presidency of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations this year. As host, India has cast itself as a rising superpower while leveraging its position on the global stage to bridge the gap between the West and Russia.\\nDzhaparova urged India to use its presidency to spotlight the crisis in Ukraine by inviting Ukrainian officials to the G-20 events and summit, which will be held in September.\\nShe said her visit was “a mark of friendship” and hoped it would kickstart Ukraine’s dialogue with India. “Let us make Ukraine more visible in India, let us help Ukraine to tell its own story, let us also bring India closer” to Ukraine, Dzhaparova said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAirstrikes by Myanmar’s military on Tuesday killed as many as 100 people, including many children, who were attending a ceremony held by opponents of army rule, said a witness, a member of a local pro-democracy group and independent media.\\nThe military is increasingly using airstrikes to counter a widespread armed struggle against its rule, which began in February 2021 when it seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. More than 3,000 civilians are estimated to have been killed since then by security forces.\\nA witness told The Associated Press that a fighter jet dropped bombs directly onto a crowd of people who were gathering at 8 a.m. for the opening of a local office of the country’s opposition movement outside Pazigyi village in Sagaing region’s Kanbalu township. The area is about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Mandalay, the country’s second-largest city.\\nAbout half an hour later, a helicopter appeared and fired at the site, said the witness, who asked not to be identified because he feared punishment by the authorities.\\nInitial reports put the death toll at around 50, but later tallies reported by independent media raised it to about 100. It was impossible to independently confirm details of the attack because reporting is restricted by the military government.\\n“I was standing a short distance from the crowd when a friend of mine contacted me on the phone about the approach of a fighter jet,” the witness said. “The jet dropped bombs directly on the crowd, and I jumped into a nearby ditch and hid. A few moments later, when I stood up and looked around, I saw people cut to pieces and dead in the smoke. The office building was destroyed by fire. About 30 people were injured. While the wounded were being transported, a helicopter arrived and shot more people. We are now cremating the bodies quickly.”\\nAbout 150 people had gathered for the opening ceremony, and women and 20 to 30 children were among the dead, he said, adding that those killed also included leaders of locally formed anti-government armed groups and other opposition organizations.\\nThe United Nations, United States and others strongly condemned the attack and pledged to work toward holding the military accountable.\\n’This heinous act by the terrorist military is yet another example of their indiscriminate use of extreme force against innocent civilians, constituting a war crime,” the opposition National Unity Government said in a statement. The NUG calls itself the country’s legitimate government, in opposition to the army. The office being opened Tuesday was part of its administrative network.\\nThe military government’s spokesperson, Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, acknowledged in a statement phoned to state television MRTV that the ceremony had been attacked, but accused anti-government forces in the area of carrying out a violent campaign of terror. He said the People’s Defense Forces — the armed wing of the National Unity Government -- had terrorized residents into supporting them, killing Buddhist monks, teachers and other people, while the military sought peace and stability. He said there was evidence the attack had set off secondary blasts of explosives hidden by the People’s Defense Forces around the site.\\nIn response to accusations of abuses, the military government often accuses pro-democracy forces of terrorism. But analysts for the United Nations and non-governmental organizations have gathered credible evidence of large-scale human rights abuses by the army, including the burning of entire villages and displacement of more than a million people, triggering a humanitarian crisis.\\nThe death toll from Tuesday’s air attack, if confirmed, could be the highest in more than two years of civil conflict that began when the army seized power in 2021. As many as 80 people were killed last October in another government air attack in northern Myanmar on an anniversary celebration of the Kachin ethnic minority’s main political organization, which is also battling the military government.\\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the army takeover triggered widespread popular opposition. After peaceful demonstrations were put down with lethal force, many opponents of military rule took up arms, and large parts of the country are now embroiled in conflict.\\nThe army has been conducting major offensives in the countryside, where it has faced some of the toughest resistance in Sagaing, in Myanmar’s historic heartland. The resistance forces have no defense against air attacks.\\nIn videos of the devastated village seen by AP, survivors and onlookers stumble through the area of the attack amid clouds of thick smoke, with only the skeleton frame of one building still standing in the distance. The videos could not immediately be verified but matched other descriptions of the scene.\\nSome motorbikes remained intact while others were reduced to their frames or buried under tree branches. In one area, two victims lay close together, one of whom had only one arm still attached.\\nAnother victim lay face down in a small grove by the roadside. A few meters (yards) away, a small torso missing at least one limb could be seen.\\nIn January, Myanmar’s top leader told the military it needs to take decisive action against those opposed to army rule. Senior Gen.

Many Western nations have imposed arms embargoes on the military government, and the United States and Britain recently enacted new sanctions targeting individuals and companies involved in supplying jet fuel to Myanmar.\\nThe human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement Tuesday that “The relentless air attacks across Myanmar highlight the urgent need to suspend the import of aviation fuel. Amnesty reiterates its calls on all states and businesses to stop shipments that may end up in the hands of the Myanmar Air Force.”\\nIt also urged the U.N. Security Council to “push through effective actions to hold the Myanmar military accountable, including by referring the situation in the country to the International Criminal Court.”\\nThe United Nations said those responsible for the attack must be brought to justice, with U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric stressing that the injured must receive medical treatment, which is “often a challenge in these circumstances.” Myanmar’s government-run hospitals are short on staff and supplies, and opponents of the military avoid them for safety reasons.\\nU.N.

       "  '\\nA Louisville bank employee armed with a rifle opened fire at his workplace Monday morning, killing five people — including a close friend of Kentucky’s governor — while livestreaming the attack on Instagram, authorities said.\\nPolice arrived as shots were still being fired inside Old National Bank and killed the shooter in an exchange of gunfire, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Jacquelyn Gwinn-Villaroel said. The city’s mayor, Craig Greenberg, called the attack “an evil act of targeted violence.”\\nThe shooting, the 15th mass killing in the country this year, comes just two weeks after a former student killed three children and three adults at a Christian elementary school in Nashville, Tennessee, about 160 miles (260 kilometers) to the south. That state’s governor and his wife also had friends killed in that shooting.\\nIn Louisville, the chief identified the shooter as 25-year-old Connor Sturgeon, who she said was livestreaming during the attack.\\n“That’s tragic to know that that incident was out there and captured,” she said.\\nMeta, the company that owns Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that it had “quickly removed the livestream of this tragic incident this morning.”\\nSocial media companies have imposed tougher rules over the past few years to prohibit violent and extremist content. They have set up systems to remove posts and streams that violate those restrictions, but shocking material like the Louisville shooting continues to slip through the cracks, prompting lawmakers and other critics to lash out at the technology industry for slipshod safeguards and moderation policies.\\nNine people, including two police officers, were treated for injuries from the Louisville shooting, University of Louisville Hospital spokeswoman Heather Fountaine said in an email. One of the wounded, identified as 57-year-old Deana Eckert, later died, police said Monday night.\\nOne of the wounded officers, 26-year-old Nickolas Wilt, graduated from the police academy on March 31. He was in critical condition after being shot in the head and having surgery, the police chief said. At least three patients had been discharged.\\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said he lost one of his closest friends in the shooting — Tommy Elliott — in the building not far from the minor league ballpark Louisville Slugger Field and Waterfront Park.\\n“Tommy Elliott helped me build my law career, helped me become governor, gave me advice on being a good dad,” said Beshear, his voice shaking with emotion. “He’s one of the people I talked to most in the world, and very rarely were we talking about my job. He was an incredible friend.”\\nAlso killed in the shooting were Josh Barrick, Jim Tutt and Juliana Farmer, police said.\\n“These are irreplaceable, amazing individuals that a terrible act of violence tore from all of us,” the governor said.\\nIt was the second time that Beshear was personally touched by a mass tragedy since becoming governor.\\nIn late 2021, one of the towns devastated by tornadoes that tore through Kentucky was Dawson Springs, the hometown of Beshear’s father, former two-term Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear. Andy Beshear frequently visited Dawson Springs as a boy and has talked emotionally about his father’s hometown.\\nBeshear spoke as the investigation in Louisville continued and police searched for a motive. Crime scene investigators could be seen marking and photographing numerous bullet holes in the windows near the bank’s front door.\\nAs part of the investigation, police descended on the neighborhood where the suspect lived, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) south of the downtown shooting. The street was blocked as federal and local officers talked to residents. One home was cordoned off with caution tape. Kami Cooper, who lives in the neighborhood, said she didn’t recall ever meeting the suspect but said it’s an unnerving feeling to have lived on the same street as someone who could do such a thing.\\n“I’m almost speechless. You see it on the news but not at home,” Cooper said. “It’s unbelievable, it could happen here, somebody on my street.”\\nA man who fled the building during the shooting told WHAS-TV that the shooter opened fire with a long rifle in a conference room in the back of the building’s first floor.\\n“Whoever was next to me got shot — blood is on me from it,” he told the news station, pointing to his shirt. He said he fled to a break room and shut the door.\\nDeputy Police Chief Paul Humphrey said the actions of responding police officers undoubtedly saved lives.\\n“This is a tragic event,” he said. “But it was the heroic response of officers that made sure that no more people were more seriously injured than what happened.”\\nJust a few hours later and blocks away, an unrelated shooting killed one man and wounded a woman outside a community college, police said.\\nThe 15 mass shootings this year are the most during the first 100 days of a calendar year since 2009, when 16 had occurred by April 10, according to a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with Northeastern University.\\nGoing back to 2006, the first year for which data has been compiled, the years with the most mass killings were 2019 and 2022, with 45 and 42 mass killings recorded during the entire calendar year. The pace in 2009 slowed later in the year, with 32 mass killings recorded that year.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nChina’s military sent several dozen warplanes and warships toward Taiwan in a large-scale exercise that simulated sealing off the island in response to its president’s trip to the U.S.\\nThe Chinese military earlier had announced three-day “combat readiness patrols” which it called Joint Sword, as a warning to Taiwan, a self-ruled island which China claims as its own. Beijing says contact between foreign officials and the island’s democratic government encourages Taiwanese who want formal independence, a step China’s ruling Communist Party says would lead to war.\\nThe sides split in 1949 after a civil war, and the ruling party says the island is obliged to rejoin the mainland, by force if necessary. Military analysts suggest that in the event of a war, China may block sea and air traffic around Taiwan, preventing the United States, Japan or other nations from intervening or sending supplies to help the island defend itself.\\nChina’s latest military actions follow President Tsai Ing-wen’s delicate diplomatic mission to shore up Taiwan’s dwindling alliances in Central America and boost its U.S. support, a trip capped with a sensitive meeting with U.S. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in California. A U.S. congressional delegation also met with Tsai over the weekend in Taiwan after she returned.\\nChina responded to the McCarthy meeting by imposing a travel ban and financial sanctions against those associated with Tsai’s U.S. trip and with increased military activity through the weekend.\\nOn Monday morning, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army said its Shandong aircraft carrier for the first time was taking part in the exercises encircling Taiwan. It showed a video of a fighter jet taking off the deck of the ship, according to a post from the PLA’s Eastern Command on Weibo, the social media platform.\\nState broadcaster CCTV, citing the PLA, said the exercises are “simulating the joint sealing off” of Taiwan as well as “waves of simulated strikes” at important targets on the island.\\nBetween 6 a.m. Sunday and 6 a.m. Monday, a total of 70 planes were detected and half crossed the median of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial boundary once tacitly accepted by both sides, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of National Defense. Among the planes that crossed the median were 8 J-16 fighter jets, 4 J-1 fighters, 8 Su-30 fighters and reconnaissance planes.\\nLater Monday morning, Taiwan’s defense ministry reported another 59 flights by bombers, as well as multiple fighter jets.\\nThat followed a full day between Friday and Saturday, where eight warships and 71 planes were detected near Taiwan, according to the island’s Defense Ministry. The ministry said in a statement it was approaching the situation from the perspective of “not escalating conflict, and not causing disputes.”\\nTaiwan said it monitored the Chinese moves through its land-based missile systems, as well as on its own navy vessels.\\nChina’s military harassment of Taiwan has intensified in recent years with planes or ships sent toward the island on a near-daily basis, with the numbers rising in reaction to sensitive activities.\\nIn addition to combat readiness patrols, China’s PLA would hold “live fire training” in Luoyuan Bay in China’s Fujian province opposite Taiwan, the local Maritime Authority announced over the weekend.\\nMeanwhile, to the south in the South China Sea, the U.S. 7th Fleet said its missile destroyer USS Milius sailed by Mischief Reef in a freedom of navigation operation. China had built an artificial island on the sea feature to stake its claim to the disputed territory.\\nChina said the U.S. “illegally trespassed” into waters near the reef without the permission of the Chinese government, according to a statement from the Chinese military’s southern command.\\nOne of the U.S. representatives who attended the meeting with Tsai last week said Saturday the U.S. must take seriously the threat China posed to Taiwan. Republican Mike Gallagher, chairman of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, told The Associated Press that he plans to lead his committee in working to shore up the island government’s defenses, encouraging Congress to expedite military aid to Taiwan.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt was a celebratory atmosphere for officials gathered just hours away from several of India’s major tiger reserves in the southern city of Mysuru, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced Sunday to much applause that the country’s tiger population has steadily grown to over 3,000 since its flagship conservation program began 50 years ago after concerns that numbers of the big cats were dwindling.\\n“India is a country where protecting nature is part of our culture,” Modi proclaimed. “This is why we have many unique achievements in wildlife conservation.”\\nModi also launched the International Big Cats Alliance that he said will focus on the protection and conservation of seven big cat species, namely, the tiger, lion, leopard, snow leopard, puma, jaguar and cheetah.\\nProtesters, meanwhile, are telling their own stories Sunday of how they have been displaced by wildlife conservation projects over the last half-century, with dozens demonstrating about an hour away from the announcement.\\nProject Tiger began in 1973 after a census of the big cats found India’s tigers were fast going extinct through habitat loss, unregulated sport hunting, increased poaching and retaliatory killing by people. It’s believed the tiger population was around 1,800 at the time, but experts widely consider that an overestimate due to imprecise counting methods in India until 2006. Laws attempted to address the decline, but the conservation model centered around creating protected reserves where ecosystems can function undisturbed by people.\\nSeveral Indigenous groups say the conservation strategies, deeply influenced by American environmentalism, meant uprooting numerous communities that had lived in the forests for millennia.\\nMembers of several Indigenous or Adivasi groups — as Indigenous people are known in the country — set up the Nagarahole Adivasi Forest Rights Establishment Committee to protest evictions from their ancestral lands and seek a voice in how the forests are managed.\\n“Nagarahole was one of the first forests to be brought under Project Tiger and our parents and grandparents were probably among the first to be forced out of the forests in the name of conservation,” said J. A. Shivu, 27, who belongs to the Jenu Kuruba tribe. “We have lost all rights to visit our lands, temples or even collect honey from the forests. How can we continue living like this?”\\nJenu, which means honey in the southern Indian Kannada language, is the tribe’s primary source of livelihood as they collect it from beehives in the forests to sell.\\nThe fewer than 40,000 Jenu Kuruba people are one of the 75 tribal groups that the Indian government classifies as particularly vulnerable. Adivasi communities like the Jenu Kurubas are among the poorest in India.\\nSome experts say conservation policies that attempted to protect a pristine wilderness were influenced by prejudices against local communities.\\nThe Indian government’s tribal affairs ministry has repeatedly said it is working on Adivasi rights. Only about 1% of the more than 100 million Adivasis in India have been granted any rights over forest lands despite a government forest rights law, passed in 2006, that aimed to “undo the historical injustice” for forest communities.\\nIndia’s tiger numbers, meanwhile, are thriving: the country’s 3,167 tigers account for more than 75% of the world’s wild tiger population.\\nTigers have disappeared in Bali and Java and China’s tigers are likely extinct in the wild. The Sunda Island tiger, the other sub-species, is only found in Sumatra. India’s project to safeguard them has been praised as a success by many.\\n“Project Tiger hardly has a parallel in the world since a scheme of this scale and magnitude has not been so successful elsewhere,” said SP Yadav, a senior Indian government official in charge of Project Tiger.\\nBut critics say the social costs of fortress conservation — where forest departments protect wildlife and prevent local communities from entering forest regions — is high.\\nSharachchandra Lele, of the Bengaluru-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, said the conservation model is outdated.\\n“There are already several examples of forests used actively by local communities and tiger numbers have actually increased even while people have benefited in these regions,” he said.\\nVidya Athreya, the director of Wildlife Conservation Society in India who has been studying the interactions between large cats and humans for the last two decades, agreed.\\n“Traditionally we always put wildlife over people,” Athreya said, adding that engaging with communities is the way forward for protecting wildlife in India.\\nShivu, from the Jenu Kuruba tribe, also wants to go back to a life where Indigenous communities and tigers lived together.\\n“We consider them gods and us the custodians of these forests,” he said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAfghan religious scholars Saturday criticized a ban on female education, as a key Taliban minister warned clerics not to rebel against the government on the controversial issue.\\nGirls cannot go to school beyond sixth grade in Afghanistan, with the education ban extending to universities. Women are barred from public spaces, including parks, and most forms of employment. Last week, Afghan women were barred from working at the U.N., according to the global body, although the Taliban have yet to make a public announcement.\\nAuthorities present the education restrictions as temporary suspensions rather than bans, but universities and schools reopened in March without their female students.\\nThe bans have raised fierce international uproar, increasing the country’s isolation at a time when its economy has collapsed and worsenied a humanitarian crisis.\\nTwo religious scholars who are well-known within Afghanistan said Saturday that authorities should reconsider their decision. Public opposition to Taliban policies is rare, although some Taliban leaders have voiced their disagreement with the decision-making process.\\nOne scholar, Abdul Rahman Abid, said institutions should be permitted to re-admit girls and women through separate classes, hiring female teachers, staggering timetables, and even building new facilities.\\nKnowledge is obligatory in Islam for men and women, he told The Associated Press, and Islam allows women to study.\\n“My daughter is absent from school, I am ashamed, I have no answer for my daughter,” he said. “My daughter asks why girls are not allowed to learn in the Islamic system. I have no answer for her.”\\nHe said reform is needed and warned that any delays are at the expense of the global Islamic community and also weakens the government.\\nAnother scholar, who is a member of the Taliban, told the AP there is still time for ministries to solve the problem of girls’ education. Toryali Himat cited ministries comprising the inner circle of the supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, who is based in Kandahar.\\nIt was on his orders that the government banned girls from classrooms. Himat said there are two types of criticism, one that destroys the system and another that makes corrective criticism.\\n“Islam has allowed both men and women to learn, but hijab and curriculum should be considered,” said Himat. “Corrective criticism should be given and the Islamic emirate should think about this. Where there is no criticism, there is the possibility of corruption. My personal opinion is that girls should get education up to university level.”\\nActing Higher Education Minister Nida Mohammad Nadim said Friday that clerics should not speak against government policy.\\nHe made his remarks after another scholar, Abdul Sami Al Ghaznawi, told students at a religious school that there was no conflict over girls’ education. He said Islamic scripture was clear that girls’ education was acceptable. Al Ghaznawi was not immediately available for comment.\\nNadim appeared to target Al Ghaznawi by mentioning “an honorable scholar” at the top of a video statement released on social media.\\n“You encouraged the people to rebel, so what is the result?” Nadim said. “The result is that rebellion against this (ban) is allowed. If people are encouraged to rebel against the system, will it benefit Muslims?”\\nThe minister was not immediately available for comment. But his spokesman, Hafiz Ziaullah Hashimi, confirmed Nadim’s remarks without giving further details about who they were directed at or the reason behind them.\\n',\n",

He accused the WHO of “attempting to smear China” and said it should avoid helping others “politicize COVID-19.”\\nThe global health body’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said March 17 that newly disclosed genetic material gathered in Wuhan in central China, where the first cases were detected in late 2019, “should have been shared three years ago.”\\n“As a responsible country and as scientists, we have always actively shared research results with scientists from around the world,” Shen said at a news conference.\\nThe origins of COVID-19 are still debated and the focus of bitter political dispute.\\nMany scientists believe it jumped from animals to humans at a market in Wuhan, but the city also is home to laboratories including China’s top facility for collecting viruses. That prompted suggestions COVID-19 might have leaked from one.\\nThe ruling Communist Party has tried to deflect criticism of its handling of the outbreak by spreading uncertainty about its origins.\\nOfficials have repeated anti-U.S. conspiracy theories that the virus was created by Washington and smuggled into China. The government also says the virus might have entered China on mail or food shipments, though scientists abroad see no evidence to support that.\\nChinese officials suppressed information about the Wuhan outbreak in 2019 and punished a doctor who warned others about the new disease. The ruling party reversed course in early 2020 and shut down access to major cities and most international travel to contain the disease.\\nThe genetic material cited by the WHO’s Tedros was uploaded recently to a global database but collected in 2020 at a Wuhan market where wildlife was sold.\\nThe samples show DNA from raccoon dogs mingled with the virus, scientists say. They say that adds evidence to the hypothesis COVID-19 came from animals, not a lab, but doesn’t resolve the question of where it started. They say the virus also might have spread to raccoon dogs from humans.\\nThe information was removed by Chinese officials from the database after foreign scientists asked the CDC about it, but it had been copied by a French expert and shared with researchers outside China.\\nA CDC researcher, Zhou Lei, who worked in Wuhan, said Chinese scientists “shared all the data we had” and “adhered to principles of openness, objectivity and transparency.”\\nShen said scientists investigated the possibility of a laboratory leak and “fully shared our research and data without any concealment or reservation.”\\nShen said the source of COVID-19 had yet to be found, but he noted it took years to identify the AIDS virus and its origin still is unclear.\\n“Some forces and figures who instigate and participate in politicizing the traceability issue and attempting to smear China should not assume that the vision of the scientific community around the world will be blinded by their clumsy manipulation,” Shen said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIsrael launched rare strikes in southern Lebanon early Friday and pressed on with bombing targets in the Gaza Strip, marking a widening escalation in the region following violence this week at Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site.\\nThe cross-border fighting erupted during a time of heightened religious fervor — when Jews are celebrating the Passover holiday and Muslims are marking the Ramadan holy month. In 2021, an escalation also triggered by clashes at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, spilled over into an 11-day war between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas rulers.\\nFriday’s strikes in southern Lebanon came a day after militants fired nearly three dozen rockets from there at Israel, wounding two people and causing some property damage. The Israeli military said it targeted installations of Hamas, the Palestinian militant group, in southern Lebanon.\\nAssociated Press correspondents in the area said several missiles fired by Israeli warplanes struck an open field in the town of Qalili near the Palestinian refugee camp of Rashidiyeh, close to the coastal southern city of Tyre, while others struck a bridge and power transformer in the nearby town of Maaliya and a farm on the outskirts of Rashidiyeh, killing several sheep. No human deaths were reported.\\nIsraeli strikes in Lebanon risk drawing Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia into the fighting, which could lead to war. The Iran-backed group, armed with thousands of rockets and missiles, holds sway over much of southern Lebanon and is viewed by Israel as a bitter foe.\\nThe Israeli military was careful to note in its announcement about Friday’s attack that it was targeting only sites linked to Palestinian militants. In recent years, Hezbollah has stayed out of other flareups related to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which stands on a hilltop revered by Muslims and Jews.\\nIn Jerusalem before dawn prayers on Friday, violence erupted again at the hilltop compound as Israeli police stationed at one of the gates forcibly dispersed vast crowds of worshippers who chanted praise for Hamas while pushing their way into the limestone courtyard. Videos from the scene showed police beating large groups of Palestinian men with sticks until they stumbled backward, falling and knocking down vendors’ tables.\\nThe head of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, Maj. Gen. Aroldo Lázaro, said he was in contact with Israeli and Lebanese authorities early Friday. The force, known as UNIFIL, said that both sides have said they do not want war.\\nMeanwhile, Israeli air strikes on Gaza resumed early Friday, after militants fired more rockets from the blockaded territory, setting off air raid sirens in the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon. The military said targets included the entry shaft to an underground network used for weapons manufacturing.\\nThe current round of violence began Wednesday after Israeli police twice raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City. That led Thursday to rocket fire from Gaza and, in a significant escalation, the rocket barrage from Lebanon.\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his Security Cabinet for a three-hour meeting late Thursday. “Israel’s response, tonight and beyond, will extract a heavy price from our enemies,” he said in a statement after the meeting.\\nAlmost immediately, Palestinian militants in Gaza began firing rockets into southern Israel, setting off air raid sirens across the region. Loud explosions could be heard in Gaza from the Israeli strikes, as outgoing rockets whooshed into the skies toward Israel. For now, Palestinian militants have fired only short-range rockets from Gaza, rather than the long-range projectiles that can reach as far as Tel Aviv and typically invite harsher Israeli retaliation.\\nThe Israeli military said the rocket fire on its northern and southern fronts was carried out by Palestinian militants in connection to this week’s violence at Al-Aqsa where Israeli police stormed into the building with tear gas and stun grenades to confront Palestinians barricaded inside on two straight days. The violent scenes from the mosque ratcheted up tensions across the region.\\nIn a briefing with reporters, Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, an Israeli military spokesman, said the army drew a clear connection between the Lebanese rocket fire and the recent unrest in Jerusalem.\\n“It’s a Palestinian-oriented event,” he said, adding that either the Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups, which are based in Gaza but also operate in Lebanon, could be involved. But he said the army believed that Hezbollah and the Lebanese government were aware of what happened and also held responsibility.\\nThe mosque — the third-holiest site in Islam — stands on a hilltop revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, the holiest site in Judaism. The competing claims to the site have repeatedly spilled over into violence over the years.\\nNo faction in Lebanon claimed responsibility for the salvo of rockets. A Lebanese security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media, said the country’s security forces believed the rockets were launched by a Lebanon-based Palestinian militant group, not by Hezbollah.\\nLebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, condemned the firing of rockets from Lebanon, adding that Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers were investigating and trying to find the perpetrators. Mikati said his government “categorically rejects any military escalation” and the use of Lebanese territories to stage acts that threaten stability.\\nHezbollah has condemned the Israeli police raids in Jerusalem. Both Israel and Hezbollah have avoided an all-out conflict since a 34-day war in 2006 ended in a draw.\\nThe current escalation comes against the backdrop of Netanyahu’s domestic problems. For the past three months, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been demonstrating against his plans to overhaul the country’s judicial system, claiming it will lead the country toward authoritarianism.\\nKey military units, including fighter pilots, have threatened to stop reporting for duty if the overhaul is passed, drawing a warning from Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that Israel’s national security could be harmed by the divisive plan. Netanyahu said he was firing Gallant, but then backtracked as he put the overhaul on hold for several weeks. Critics could also accuse him of trying to use the crisis to divert attention from his domestic woes.\\nNetanyahu said that the domestic divisions had no impact on national security and that the country would remain united in the face of external threats.\\nTensions have simmered along the Lebanese border as Israel appears to have ratcheted up its shadow war against Iranian-linked targets in Syria, another close ally of Iran, Israel’s archenemy in the region.\\nSuspected Israeli airstrikes in Syria in recent weeks have killed two Iranian military advisers and temporarily put the country’s two largest airports out of service. Hecht, the military spokesman, said Thursday’s rocket fire was not believed to be connected to events in Syria.\\nIn Washington, the principal deputy State Department spokesman, Vedant Patel, said, “Israel has legitimate security concerns and has every right to defend themselves.”\\nBut he also urged calm in Jerusalem, saying that “any unilateral action that jeopardizes the status quo to us is unacceptable,” he said.\\nIn Jerusalem, the situation remained tense at Al-Aqsa. For the previous two nights, Palestinians barricaded themselves in the mosque with stones and firecrackers.\\nWorshippers have been demanding the right to pray overnight inside the mosque — which authorities typically only permit during the last 10 days of the monthlong Ramadan holiday. They also have stayed in the mosque in protest over threats by religious Jews to carry out a ritual animal slaughter at the sacred site for Passover.\\nIsrael did not try to prevent people from spending the night in the mosque early Friday — apparently because it was the weekend, when Jews do not visit the compound. But tensions could re-ignite Sunday when Jewish visits resume.\\nIsrael bars ritual slaughter on the site, but calls by Jewish extremists to revive the practice, including offers of cash rewards to anyone who even attempts to bring an animal into the compound, have amplified fears among Muslims that Israel is plotting to take over the site\\nIn this week’s violence, Israeli police fired stun grenades and rubber bullets to evict worshippers who had locked the doors of the building. Palestinians hurled stones and fireworks at officers. After a few hours of scuffles that left a trail of damage, police managed to drag everyone out of the compound.\\nPolice fiercely beat Palestinians and arrested over 400 people. Israeli authorities control access to the area but the compound is administered by Islamic and Jordanian officials.\\nThe violence at the site has resonated across the region, with condemnations pouring in from Muslim leaders.\\n',\n",

He called on other governments to avoid doing anything that might “make the crisis deteriorate or even get out of control.”\\nBeijing, which sees Moscow as a partner in opposing U.S. domination of global affairs, has tried to appear neutral in the conflict but has given Putin diplomatic support and repeated Russian justifications for the February 2022 attack. Xi received an effusive welcome from Putin when he visited Moscow last month, giving the isolated Russian president a political boost.\\nThe Chinese leader said “legitimate security concerns of all parties” should be considered, a reference to Moscow’s argument that it attacked Ukraine because of the eastward expansion of NATO, the U.S.-European military alliance.\\nDuring talks earlier, Macron appealed to Xi to “bring Russia to its senses and bring everyone back to the negotiating table.”\\nMacron pointed to Chinese support for the United Nations Charter, which calls for respect of a country’s territorial integrity. He said Putin’s announcement of plans to deploy nuclear weapons in Belarus violated international agreements and commitments to Xi’s government.\\n“We need to find a lasting peace,” the French president said. “I believe that this is also an important issue for China.”\\nMacron was accompanied to Beijing by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a show of European unity.\\nVon der Leyen said she encouraged Xi to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and the Chinese leader “reiterated his willingness to speak when conditions and time are right.”\\n“I think this is a positive element,” von der Leyen said.\\nVon der Leyen warned China against sending military equipment to Russia, echoing a warning Wednesday by NATO’s 31 member governments of “severe consequences” for shipments of weapons or ammunition.\\n“Arming the aggressor is a clear violation of international law,” von der Leyen said. “This would indeed significantly harm the relationship between the European Union and China.”\\nChina is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.\\n“China has always adhered to an objective and fair position on the issue of the Ukraine crisis,” said a Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning. “We have been an advocate of a political solution to the crisis and a promoter of peace talks.”\\nAlso Wednesday, the French and Chinese governments announced agreements including the purchase of 160 Airbus aircraft by a Chinese leasing company and for their companies to collaborate on nuclear, solar, wind power and biofuel development.\\n',\n",

Beijing has refused to criticize the Kremlin but has tried to appear neutral and has called for a cease-fire and peace talks.\\nIn a speech to French residents of China, Macron said he would “try to build, and somehow engage China toward a shared responsibility for peace and stability on international issues” including Ukraine, Iran and North Korea.\\nMacron expressed hope China will “participate in initiatives that are useful to the Ukrainian people.”\\n“Dialogue with China is indispensable,” Macron said during the event at the French Embassy.\\nXi’s government sees Russia as a source of energy and as a partner in opposing what both say is U.S. domination of global affairs.\\nChina is the biggest buyer of Russian oil and gas, which helps to prop up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions. That increases Chinese influence, but Xi appears reluctant to jeopardize that partnership by pressuring Putin.\\nMacron noted Putin’s announcement that Moscow plans to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, which China opposes.\\n“Territorial integrity, the sovereignty of nations is part” of the Charter of the United Nations, which China affirmed, Macron said.\\nDefending those principles “means moving forward together and trying to find a path for peace,” Macron said. He noted China proposed a peace plan in February and that while France doesn’t fully agree with it, the plan “shows a will to commit toward the resolution of the conflict.”\\nMeanwhile, NATO’s 31 member countries warned Wednesday of “severe consequences” should China start sending weapons and ammunition to Russia.\\n“Allies have been clear that any provision of lethal aid by China to Russia would be a historic mistake, with profound implications,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters after chairing a meeting of the organization’s foreign ministers in Brussels.\\nStoltenberg declined to say what the implications of such a move might be, but warned only that it would involve “severe consequences.”\\n“At a time when Beijing and Moscow are pushing back against the rules-based international order, it is even more important that we continue to stand together,” he said.\\nLast week, von der Leyen warned the European Union must be prepared to develop measures to protect trade and investment that China might exploit for its own security and military purposes.\\nThierry Breton, EU commissioner for internal market, said Monday on French news broadcaster FranceInfo the message to Chinese authorities is that they “must stop trying to play one country against another.”\\nMacron also said “several major deals” were due to be signed between French and Chinese companies during the visit. He was accompanied by more than 50 French CEOs including from Airbus, railway equipment manufacturer Alstom and energy giant EDF.\\nA French official said last week negotiations were underway on a potential deal with Airbus that would come on top of China’s 2019 order for 300 aircraft.\\nMacron said he will push for “working in partnership” with China on climate. He said France will organize a global conference on the protection of oceans in 2025 and said China should be part of these efforts.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0A man with a hatchet burst into a day care center Wednesday in Brazil, killing four children, authorities said, in an attack that shook the country and put pressure on the government to curb a rising tide of violence.\\nAt least four other children were wounded in the attack in Blumenau, a city of 366,000 in southern Brazil, near the Atlantic coast.\\nThe assailant, who got inside by jumping over a wall, turned himself in at a police station, officials said. He did not appear to have any connection with the center, which offers nursery services, preschool education and after-school activities. The dead were between the ages of 5 and 7, authorities said.\\nAuthorities were searching for a motive, the police detective leading the investigation, Ronnie Esteves, told television reporters.\\nHours after the attack, the justice and education ministers pledged to invest in new violence-prevention efforts.\\nValeria Aparecida Camilo, the mother of 5-year-old girl at the center, said she was working when a colleague saw the news. She called her husband, Gustavo, who rushed to the school and later learned that his daughter had survived.\\n“The moment I saw her, it was a relief,” Gustavo Camilo told The Associated Press outside the center. “But we feel sorry for everything that has happened, with the other kids who wound up dying.”\\n“They have no cruelty, they’re kids,” Valeria added. “They’re 5 years old. What did a 5-year-old do to this person?”\\nFranciele Chequeto said one of the girls killed was friends with her 7-year-old son, Gabriel.\\n“He wasn’t understanding,” Chequeto said. “I sat down and told him that he no longer will be able to see some of his little friends.”\\nThe state’s civil police chief, Ulisses Gabriel, confirmed that the attacker was a 25-year-old man from neighboring Parana state. He will be charged with murder and attempted murder. Police believe the attack was an isolated act and not related to any other crimes, Gabriel said.\\nImages broadcast on networks showed weeping parents outside the private day care center called Cantinho do Bom Pastor.\\nThe attack took place on the center’s playground, according to the local affiliate of television network Globo. NSC, the affiliate, showed a photo of the suspect with a closely shaved head. Police have yet to confirm his identity.\\nBlumenau’s mayor, Mário Hildebrandt, suspended classes and said he will declare a 30-day mourning period. Authorities said any reports of other attacks or threats against schools in the region were false.\\nSchool attacks in Brazil have happened with greater frequency in recent years. Last week, a student in Sao Paulo fatally stabbed a teacher and wounded several others in Sao Paulo.\\nBrazil has seen at least one past attack on a day care center. That attack also occurred in Santa Catarina state, in May 2021, when an assailant used a dagger to kill three children under 2 years old and two adults.\\nFrom 2000 to 2022, 16 attacks or violent episodes happened in schools, four of them in the second half of last year, according to a report from researchers led by Daniel Cara, an education professor at the University of Sao Paulo. The 12 researchers — comprised of psychologists, social scientists, public school educators, journalists and activists — prepared the report for the government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.\\nBrazilian Justice Minister Flávio Dino told reporters in Brasilia that he was directing 150 million reais ($30 million) from the nation’s public security fund to shore up school safety. That money will pay for both heightened policing and an expansion of a Brasilia-based team for the monitoring of deep-web communities, he said. Earlier Wednesday, Dino met with representatives from student associations.\\nMeanwhile, Education Minister Camilo Santana announced the creation of a group to address school violence. Santana will lead the group, which is scheduled to meet for the first time Thursday.\\nThere is no single factor to explain the rise of such attacks, but a common denominator is what Cara calls “a crisis of perspective” regarding economic problems and the likelihood that each assailant endured situations of frustration and violence, including bullying and harassment.\\n“Given the lack of perspective and the way they were victimized,” they get recruited by online communities and seek a way to take revenge on society, Cara told the AP by phone.\\n“They are usually young people who have a masculinist, misogynistic, racist discourse, who worship neo-Nazi and fascist symbols, and who navigate in communities where violence is glorified,” Cara added.\\nExperts say April is a particularly sensitive month for school attacks as it concentrates the anniversaries of the 1999 Columbine school shooting in the U.S. and a shooting in a school in Rio de Janeiro’s metropolitan area in 2011. These events are glorified in violent communities and can act as triggers for new attacks, Cara said.\\n“There are no words to console the families. Anyone who has lost a relative knows that there are no words,” a teary-eyed President Lula said Wednesday at the outset of a ministerial meeting. He requested his ministers observe a minute of silence.\\nIn 2019, a bacterial infection claimed the life of Lula’s grandson, who was 7 years old — the same age as one of the victims in Blumenau.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDonald Trump conspired to undermine the 2016 election through a series of hush money payments designed to stifle claims that could be harmful to his candidacy, prosecutors said Tuesday in unsealing a historic 34-count felony indictment against the former president.\\nTrump, stone-faced and silent as he entered and exited the Manhattan courtroom, said “not guilty” in a firm voice while facing a judge who warned him to refrain from rhetoric that could inflame or cause civil unrest.\\nThe broad contours of the case have long been known, but the 16-page indictment contains new details about a scheme that prosecutors say involved multiple payoffs to two women, including a porn star, who said they had extramarital sexual encounters with him years earlier, as well as to a Trump Tower doorman who claimed to have a story about a child he alleged the former president had out of of wedlock.\\nThe arraignment, though largely procedural in nature, amounts to a remarkable reckoning for Trump after years of investigations into his personal, business and political dealings. The case is unfolding against the backdrop not only of his third campaign for the White House but also against other investigations in Washington and Atlanta that might yet produce even more charges.\\nTrump, his lips pursed in apparent anger, entered the courtroom shortly before 2:30 p.m. He left court about an hour later, also without commenting. All told, the voluble Trump spoke only about 10 words during the entire proceeding.\\nBefore the arraignment, he narrated his feelings in real time, describing the experience as “SURREAL” as he traveled from Trump Tower to lower Manhattan to face a judge.\\nIt represents the new split-screen reality for Trump as he submits to the dour demands of the American criminal justice system while projecting an aura of defiance and victimhood at celebratory campaign events.\\nWearing his signature dark suit and red tie, Trump turned and waved to crowds outside the building before heading inside to be fingerprinted and processed. He arrived at court in an eight-car motorcade from Trump Tower, communicating in real time his anger at the process.\\n“Heading to Lower Manhattan, the Courthouse,” he posted on his Truth Social platform. “Seems so SURREAL — WOW, they are going to ARREST ME. Can’t believe this is happening in America. MAGA!”\\nTrump, who was impeached twice by the U.S. House but was never convicted in the U.S. Senate, is the first former president to face criminal charges. The nation’s 45th commander in chief was escorted from Trump Tower to the courthouse by the Secret Service.\\n“He is strong and ready to go,” Trump lawyer Joe Tacopina told The Associated Press. Earlier, Tacopina said in a TV interview that the former president wouldn’t plead guilty to lesser charges, even if it might resolve the case. He also said he didn’t think the case would make it to a jury.\\nNew York police said they were ready for large protests by Trump supporters, who share the Republican former president’s belief that the New York grand jury indictment and three additional pending investigations are politically motivated and intended to weaken his bid to retake the White House in 2024. Journalists often outnumbered protesters, though.\\nTrump, a former reality TV star, has been hyping that narrative to his political advantage, saying he raised more than $8 million in the days since the indictment on claims of a “witch hunt.” His campaign released a fundraising request titled “My last email before arrest” and he has repeatedly assailed Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, egged on supporters to protest and claimed without evidence that the judge presiding over the case “hates me” — something his own lawyer has said is not true.\\nTrump was scheduled to return to his Palm Beach, Florida, home, Mar-a-Lago, on Tuesday evening to give remarks. At least 500 prominent supporters have been invited, with some of the most pro-Trump congressional Republicans expected to attend.\\nA conviction would not prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.\\nThe investigation is scrutinizing six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both say they had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. Trump denies having sexual liaisons with either woman and has denied any wrongdoing involving payments.\\nThe arraignment unfolded against the backdrop of heavy security in New York, coming more than two years after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s win.\\nTrump was defiant ahead of his arraignment. He used his social media network to complain that he was going to court in a heavily Democratic area, declaring, “KANGAROO COURT” and “THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE!” He and his campaign have repeatedly assailed Bragg and even trained scrutiny on members of Bragg’s family.\\nDespite that, the scenes around Trump Tower and the courthouse where Trump will stand before a judge did not feature major unrest. Police tried to keep apart protesters supporting the former president and those opposing him by confining them to separate sides of a park near the courthouse using metal barricades.\\nGeorgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s staunchest supporters in Congress, staged a brief rally at the park, but the scene was so chaotic that it was hard to hear her over the crush of reporters and protesters.\\n“We’re the party of peace,” Greene said, thanking those Trump supporters present. “Democrats are communists.”\\nEmbattled Republican New York Rep. George Santos also showed up in solidarity with Trump, saying, “I want to support the president.”\\n“I think this is unprecedented and it’s a bad day for democracy,” Santos said, suggesting that future prosecutors could target Biden and other presidents with other cases, which “cheapens the judicial system.”\\nNew York’s ability to carry out safe and drama-free courthouse proceedings in a case involving a polarizing ex-president could be an important test case as prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington conduct their own investigations of Trump that could also result in charges. Those investigations concern efforts to undo the 2020 election results as well as the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nAppointment of Nepali Congress (NC) central member Sunil Thapa as political advisor and former Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) governor Chiranjeevi Nepal as economic advisor to President Ram Chandra Paudel has invited wide-spread criticism.\\nThe president is legally allowed to appoint up to seven advisors though disciplines of the seven experts have not been specified. President Paudel has appointed three including former attorney general and provincial chief of Gandaki Baburam Kunwar as the legal advisor until now.\\nThere is doubt as to whether Thapa, who is also NC working committee member, can provide unbiased political advice to the president who has to remain neutral and act as the guardian of the country.\\nPaudel himself announced dissociation from all responsibilities of NC after being elected president but Thapa has yet to resign from party positions. Thapa argues that his central membership is suspended and he will not be involved in party activities. \\xa0“I will have to return to the party if I don’t like to stay at the President’s Office tomorrow,” he contends when asked why he has yet to resign.\\nAppointment of a salaried economic advisor similarly has drawn criticism as the Constitution does not envision any role of the president in economic affairs and the president can always invite anyone from the prime minister (PM) to the finance minister and economic experts to understand the economic situation of the country.\\nNepal responds that the question will have to be directed at President Paudel when asked why a president needs an economic advisor. He adds that President Paudel is aware of the problems facing the Nepali economy and may have recruited his services to remain informed about how those problems can be resolved.\\n“Is it not good for the protector of the country to be cognizant of what is happening in the economy in his own way?” he quips. “When Bidya Devi Bhandari was the president she would invite us and ask about what was happening in the economy. The current president may have appointed me as an expert as the economy is in a greater problem now.”\\nPersonal secretary to former president Bhandari, Bhesh Raj Adhikari, reveals that Meena Acharya was appointed as an expert for women’s and children’s affairs also to oversee economic affairs even though Bhandari had not appointed anyone as an economic advisor. “President has to advise the prime minister at times. Experts are appointed to remain informed about everything for such occasions.”\\nPresident Paudel is legally allowed to appoint four more experts as advisors but NC General Secretary Gagan Thapa has publicly spoken about the need for the president and the PM to make as few appointments in their secretariat as possible for austerity at a time when the country is facing economic problems.\\nThapa points that such measures by PM Pushpa Kamal Dahal and President Paudel, though seemingly trivial, will have a big meaning. “There will be an improvement, albeit small, if they say that they will cut all but essential expenses but increase capital expenditure that has multi-dimensional implications.” \\xa0\\nEconomic advisor to the president Nepal argues that appointing just three advisors when seven can be appointed in itself is an austerity measure.\\nAdvisor to the first president of Nepal Ram Baran Yadav, Hari Sharma, points that the president does not need to keep a jumbo team in the name of experts. “There was Interim Constitution when Ram Baran Yadav was president. There was no previous exercise of the rights and duties of the president,” Sharma reasons. “He needed comparatively more advisors then. The Constitution has specified everything now. Bidya Devi Bhandari has served two terms as per that Constitution. I don’t feel there is need for a jumbo team to advise the president now.”\\nHe explains that the president partly constitutes all three organs of the state giving examples of how the president administers oath of office and secrecy to the chief justice and grants presidential pardons on recommendation of the Cabinet; authenticates acts and ordinances and calls House sessions; and appoints ambassadors of the country and receives credentials from envoys of other countries.\\nHe adds that the Constitution has specified the role and duties of the president, and there is provision for the secretariat to facilitate fulfillment of those duties. “What kinds of experts and associates are needed for those works depends on the needs and the situation of the country,” he adds. “One may even argue, for the sake of argument, that a chef is needed for advice on cooking as the president hosts domestic and foreign guests.”\\n',\n",

The order forwarded to the parties the next day, however, mentions that there was no situation to send Lamichhane to judicial custody on the basis of closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage, the health check report of the victim, and Lamichhane’s statement, according to a source.\\n“The order forwarded to the parties also mentions that it would be inappropriate to stop the defendant from going abroad as he is a national/international player. The order read by the spokesperson mentioned the statement of the victim’s roommate and lack of semen in the victim’s body on the basis of health report as the grounds for not keeping the defendant in custody. Those grounds have now been removed.”\\nThe order given to the parties also mentions the victim’s age, which was not mentioned by Spokesperson Paudel, pointing that there seems to be a dispute as to whether the victim is a minor or not as the defendant claims that she is 19 and not 17 as claimed by her, and adds that the Kathmandu District Court should rule on the issue. \\xa0\\xa0\\nPaudel had said that the case should be fast-tracked as Lamichhane is an international player but the order forwarded to the parties says it should be fast-tracked as it is related to offense about gender violence.\\nThe order given to the parties also includes a new issue. “The District Court has been ordered to provide relief through the interim relief fund as legal professionals of the victim have told the bench that her mental state is not right,” the source added.\\nSpokesperson Paudel told Setopati that he had only read the draft order not signed by the justices on Monday as there was a hurry. “The order given after the justices finalize and sign on it is official,” Paudel has pointed. “The main part of that order is partial revocation of the Patan High Court’s order and allowing Lamichhane to go abroad to play cricket which has not been changed even now. The grounds also are the same. But there may have been some minor changes in the explanation from the draft order.”\\nThe SC on February 27 also ordered that Lamichhane should produce himself before the Kathmandu District Court within 15 days of completion of any tournament featuring Nepal abroad.

He was released on a bail of Rs 2 million the next day.\\nThe OAG in its appeal has argued that the Patan High Court’s order to release Lamichhane on bail is against legal provisions and the SC’s interpretation during bail hearing in cases of similar nature.\\nClause 27 of the National Criminal Procedure (Code) Act, 2017 has clear provision for holding the accused of any offense which is punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding three years in detention if based on the evidence available the accused appears to be guilty of the offense or there is any reasonable ground, based on such evidence, to believe that such person is guilty of the offense.\\nBut Lamichhane was released on bail despite sub-section 3 (d) of Section 219 of the National Penal (Code) Act, 2017 stating that a person who commits rape shall be liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 to 12 years if the woman is 16 or above 16 years of age but below 18 years of age. The victim in the case is 17 years.\\nThe Patan High Court ordered Lamichhane’s release on five conditions.

He told interviewer Robin Roberts he is not a racist and moved past his desire for violence after seeking help from a priest and from friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeeson said in an interview published Monday by The Independent that after learning his friend’s attacker was black, he “went up and down areas with a cosh (stick or truncheon)” hoping a black person “would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“It took me a week, maybe a week and a half, to go through that,” Neeson said.\\r\\n\\r\\nNeeson told Roberts he had asked about the race of the attacker, along with other descriptive characteristics.

       "  '\\n                            Two years ago he made the whole world dance with “Despacito,” but Luis Fonsi says he is still a romantic singer and is ready to show “all his cards” Friday with his new album, “Vida.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Many people thought I moved away from that romantic side and I always said ‘I haven’t, I’m not going anywhere.’ I am still a romantic singer, I still talk that romantic language. But at the same time I like to do both things. I don’t like to be limited,” Fonsi said in a recent interview with The Associated Press, in Spanish.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Vida” is his ninth studio album and his first in five years, a time of big changes in his life and his career — especially since 2016, when the birth of his son Rocco overlapped with that of the song that gave him international stardom and a broader exposure to Latin music. The original “Despacito” video, featuring Daddy Yankee, is still the most watched in the history of YouTube with over 5.9 billion views to date; its remix with Justin Bieber remains among the top three songs on Billboard’s list of Hot Latin Songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth versions are included in the album, along with the previously-released singles “Echame la culpa” with Demi Lovato, “Calypso” with Stefflon Don, “Imposible” with Ozuna and “Sola”. It also includes new romantic songs and one powerful torch song that challenged Fonsi’s vocal chords. One of the most personal pieces is “Ahi estas tu,” which he wrote to his son Rocco. (His previous album, “8,” included a tune for his daugher Mikaela.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are 15 songs total that cover or fuse Latin pop, R&B, dembow, reggaeton and other genres.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I want to be able to dance, make people rejoice, and sometimes sing a ballad with a lot of lyric, a lot of emotion,” said the Puerto Rican singer-songwriter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe touching R&B-infused, piano-led ballad “Dime que no te irás” is also, according to Fonsi, the most difficult to perform vocally.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt “is one of the songs with more weight in this album”, he said. “It’s one of those songs that may not have the commercial value of others, but it does have the musical and emotional value.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe also highlighted his latest single, “Sola,” a ballad that you may not hear in a club but that will make you nod to its beat.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s neither the typical depressing ballad nor a rhythmic pop song and much less a reggaeton, but it’s a hybrid of the new sound of pop and that is something that I’ve always liked to do — to innovate, to suggest new things to my audience and always to follow my own path.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn regards to the title “Vida,” he said he chose it because the album is kind of an X-ray of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\n“These songs come from very honest, real places. Many have to do with me, many don’t. But I felt that my life is there, in each song,” said Fonsi, remembering himself running between the studio to his house to other professional commitments while his wife was pregnant, Rocco was born and starting to grow. “That life, that excitement, that love that you feel as a father for a child, the most pure and intense form of love — it’s impossible not to reflect that in my music, in the way I communicate. ‘Vida’ is all that. It’s my life.”\\n',\n",

She succeeds Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters of South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Philippines, pageants are a popular attraction, and Gray’s countrymen watching the televised contest cheered wildly and jumped for joy when she was declared the winner.\\r\\n\\r\\nCelebrations were especially buoyant in Oas town in the northeastern province of Albay, from which Gray’s Filipina mother hails. According to Gray, her gown’s design, with its lava color and appearance, was influenced by Albay’s iconic Mayon Volcano.\\r\\n\\r\\nGray’s father is Australian, and she was born and grew up in Cairns, Australia. She studied at the Berklee College of Music in Boston in the United States.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was quick to congratulate the winner. Gray is the fourth Filipina to be named Miss Universe.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Ms. Gray truly made the entire Philippines proud when she sashayed on the global stage and showcased the genuine qualities defining a Filipina beauty: confidence, grace, intelligence and strength in the face of tough challenges,” he said in a statement from the presidential palace. “In her success, Miss Philippines has shown to the world that women in our country have the ability to turn dreams into reality through passion, diligence, determination and hard work.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAn early round of questioning touched on the issue of drugs, a controversial issue in the Philippines where Duterte’s aggressive ‘war on drugs’ has taken thousands of lives, many in what critics charge were extrajudicial executions. Duterte raised even more controversy when he recently joked that he smoked marijuana to deal with his busy schedule of meetings with other Asian leaders at a regional summit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsked what she thought about legalizing marijuana, Gray said: “I’m for it being used for medical use, but not so for recreational use. Because I think if people will argue, then what about alcohol and cigarettes? Everything is good but in moderation.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year’s Miss Universe competition included the first-ever transgender contestant, Angela Ponce of Spain. She said in a video presentation that it was not important for her to win but was more important for her “to be here.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the few controversies of this year’s contest involved Miss United States, Sarah Rose Summers, seeming to mock contestants from Cambodia and Vietnam over their English language skills.

       "  '\\nErling Haaland scored twice on his Premier League debut as Manchester City opened its title defense with a 2-0 win over West Ham on Sunday, showing just why Pep Guardiola spent big to bring in the striker this offseason.\\nHaaland needed 35 minutes to open his City account from the penalty spot after being brought down by the goalkeeper in the area, and then netted with a clinical low finish in the 65th minute to double the lead.\\nAfter Liverpool was held to a draw by Fulham on Saturday, City sent an early warning that it remains the team to beat in England.\\nCity led the league in scoring last season with 99 goals as it edged Liverpool to the title by one point, despite often playing without a recognized striker up front. Having the towering Haaland in the middle only makes Guardiola’s attack look even scarier.\\nAfter City struggled to break down West Ham’s defense in the opening 30 minutes, Haaland showed his speed to accelerate away from two defenders as he ran onto a pass into the box from Ilkay Gundogan and was brought down by substitute goalkeeper Alphonse Areola as they vied for the ball.\\nHe calmly dispatched the penalty by sidefooting into the left corner and then sat down cross-legged in a meditative pose — his trademark goal celebration that could become a frequent sight in the Premier League.\\nAreola, who had to come on in the 29th after Lukasz Fabianski picked up a knock, couldn’t do much to prevent the second goal, either.\\nHaaland timed his run perfectly to meet a through ball from Kevin de Bruyne and then used his left foot to slot the ball inside the far corner.\\nHaaland scored 86 goals in 89 games during his three seasons at Borussia Dortmund to establish himself as one of the most-wanted players in Europe before opting to move to City, where his father Alfie played between 2000-03.\\nAlfie Haaland celebrated in the stands as his son became just the second City player to score twice on his Premier League debut, after Sergio Aguero did so in 2011.\\nHe was taken off in the 78th to a standing ovation, having missed out on a hat trick when his header sailed high.\\nJudging by this performance, though, it won’t be long before the next goal comes along for Haaland.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNew manager, same old problems for Manchester United.\\nUnited slumped to a 2-1 loss against Brighton at Old Trafford on Sunday in Erik ten Hag’s first Premier League game in charge, dispelling any notion that the Dutch coach could provide an instant fix to the many issues that plagued the team last season.\\nUnited looked vulnerable in defense — with Pascal Gross scoring twice in the first half to put Brighton in control — and toothless in attack until Cristiano Ronaldo came on early in the second half.\\nAnd the questions about Ronaldo’s future at the club remain.\\nTen Hag decided to leave Ronaldo out of his starting lineup after the Portugal star only played 45 minutes in preseason amid reports he wants to leave for a Champions League club.\\nBut it’s clear why Ten Hag wants to keep the 37-year-old forward as United looked much more dangerous with him on the field, although the hosts needed a goalkeeping error to pull a goal back.\\nRobert Sanchez failed to punch away a corner and then got in the way of Alexis Mac Allister, who tried to clear the ball only to send it into his own net in the 68th.\\nUnited continued to push forward but never came close to an equalizer as Brighton held on for a first win at Old Trafford in the club’s history.\\n“It was obviously disappointing and the worst possible start at halftime to be 2-0 down at Old Trafford,” United defender Harry Maguire said. “Not good enough. We huffed and puffed and we got one back and we had chances to equalize, but it’s a bad start for us.”\\nWhile United improved in the second half, the first 45 minutes showed just how big a task Ten Hag is facing to turn around a club that finished sixth in the Premier League last season.\\nWhile the hosts dominated possession, the only good chance they created came in the sixth minute when a cross was deflected into the path of Bruno Fernandes, who sent his shot well high of the bar.\\nBrighton took the lead in the 30th when Danny Welbeck made a run into the area to collect a pass from Leandro Trossard near the byline and then squared the ball across goal for Gross to tap into an empty net.\\nThe second goal came after a quick counterattack, with Gross on hand to tap in the rebound after Solly March cut inside and saw his shot parried by David de Gea.\\n“I thought we had an idea of how to attack and when we could we tried to press and put them under pressure,” Brighton manager Graham Potter said. “We were positive, brave and the boys gave everything. Our performance in the first half was really strong.”\\nRonaldo instantly gave United a jolt when he came on in the 52nd and set up Marcus Rashford for a one-on-one against Sanchez in the 60th but the goalkeeper blocked the forward’s shot. The offside flag was up against Ronaldo, but replays hinted he had stayed onside.\\nThat was the closest Ronaldo came to making an impact, though, as the Ten Hag era got off to a losing start.\\nUnited’s players were booed off at halftime and at the final whistle, with Ten Hag looking grim-faced as he walked off the field.\\n',\n",

In the seventh minute, he pounced on a low cross from Achraf Hakimi to have a first-time effort deflected out by Alidu Seidu.\\nTwo minutes later, Pablo Sarabia squared the ball back for Messi, who flicked it toward Neymar. The Brazil forward controlled the ball before burying it into the bottom corner.\\nPSG capitalized on a fast break in the 26th when Neymar found Achraf Hakimi, who fired into the top corner.\\nNeymar set up the third goal with a pinpoint free kick for Marquinhos, who headed home in the 39th.\\nOn the stroke of halftime, Neymar fed Messi, whose shot was saved by goalkeeper Mory Diaw.\\nPSG slowed down a bit in the second half against a Clermont side which narrowly avoided relegation last season.\\nMessi still made it 4-0 in the 80th. He played a one-two with Neymar before netting with a low strike.\\nThe Argentina superstar sealed the win in the 86th by chesting down a ball over the top from Leandro Paredes to score with an overhead kick.\\n“What I have liked is the team’s desire to win the ball back very quickly, to play with a lot of intensity,” PSG coach Christophe Galtier said. ”Leo reacts reacts very quickly when possession is lost, and Ney has also made efforts in his defensive positioning to help the team stay very compact and win the ball.”\\nChasing a record 11th league title, PSG missed Kylian Mbappe, who is nursing a groin problem, and Renato Sanches, who was signed on Thursday and lacked match fitness.\\nPSG left out of its matchday squad some high-profile players it reportedly wants to move out: Mauro Icardi, Julian Draxler, Ander Herrera, Idrissa Gueye, Rafinha, Thilo Kehrer and Layvin Kurzawa.\\nMeanwhile, Krepin Diatta and Sofiane Diop scored for a weakened Monaco to prevail at Strasbourg 2-1.\\nIn a clash between contenders for European spots, Diatta opened the scoring with a powerful volley from the edge of the box in the 43rd. The Senegal winger could have added another goal in the 48th but Strasbourg goalkeeper Matz Sels saved his chip.\\nDiop, a France Under-21 international, doubled the lead by converting a rebound in the 53rd after Sels palmed away a deflected cross from Gelson Martins.\\nStrasbourg forward Habib Diallo pulled one back in the 65th by heading in a cross from Thomas Delaine.\\nMonaco and Strasbourg finished third and sixth, respectively, last season.\\nSels limited the damage by denying Martins in the 35th, diverting onto the post a close-range effort from Jean Lucas in the 61st, and saving a downward header from substitute Maghnes Akliouche in the 85th.\\nMonaco goalkeeper Alexander Nubel preserved the win in injury time by stopping a point-blank shot from Adrien Thomasson.\\n’We had chances to lead 3-0 and 4-0,” Monaco coach Philippe Clement said. “It’s a matter of experience. It’s normal with young players, they must learn lessons, they must gain experience in such situations.”\\nMonaco missed the suspended Kevin Volland and Aleksandr Golovin, the injured Takumi Minamino, Benoit Badiashile and Myron Boadu, and an ill Caio Henrique.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWhile Liverpool made a stuttering start to the English Premier League, Tottenham showed it might be ready to take another step forward under Antonio Conte.\\nLiverpool had to come from behind twice to salvage a 2-2 draw at promoted Fulham on Saturday, largely thanks to new signing Darwin Nunez, after a performance that Jurgen Klopp conceded was well short of the team’s standards.\\nTottenham also conceded an early goal but came roaring back to earn a 4-1 victory at home against Southampton after a dominant display that hinted that Spurs are well gelled after a full offseason under Conte, who took over as manager last November.\\nChelsea also had a winning start but in less impressive fashion, holding on for 1-0 at Everton after Jorginho netted a late first-half penalty.\\nNewcastle, Leeds and Bournemouth also won in their league openers.\\nAt Craven Cottage, Fulham threatened to pull off a major upset as Aleksandar Mitrovic put the hosts ahead twice against Liverpool. But Nunez came off the bench to score one goal and set up the other for Mohamed Salah.\\nLiverpool nearly grabbed all three points when Jordan Henderson hit the crossbar in injury time with a long-distance shot, but even Klopp agreed that a win would have been undeserved.\\n“The start of the game was really bad from us,” Klopp said. “No direction, no positivity, no opening up, no breaking lines, nothing (of) what you have to do.”\\nIt was a different story in north London, where Tottenham reacted superbly to going behind in the 12th minute.\\nRyan Sessegnon and Eric Dier put Spurs in front by halftime and Southampton defender Mohammed Salibu netted a comical own goal when trying to clear the ball off the line in the 61st minute. Dejan Kulusevski capped a stellar performance by slotting in the fourth two minutes later.\\n“It was a perfect start for us, despite going behind,” Conte said. “I liked the game a lot for the result but especially the way in which the result was created — creating many chances to score, good possession, good high and medium pressure and we were good when we lost the ball and the intensity to try and get it back. ... Today we have seen (the) summer work with my players.”\\nConte spent much of last season complaining about a lack of squad depth, but still opted not to start any of the team’s six offseason signings. Ivan Perisic, Clement Lenglet and Yves Bissouma came off the bench instead to show that Conte also has increased options this season as Spurs tries to join champion Manchester City and Liverpool in the fight for the title.\\nNEWCASTLE SPOILS FOREST’S RETURN\\nNottingham Forest spent most of the game defending in its return to the top flight after an absence of 23 years. The newcomer held firm for nearly an hour at St. James’ Park but couldn’t prevent Newcastle’s Fabian Schar from finally breaking the deadlock with a long-range shot. Newcastle won 2-0 after Callum Wilson added the second in the 78th.\\n“We were second best in the game no doubt,” Forest manager Steve Cooper said. “We coped OK in terms of possession and territory but didn’t play well enough with the ball.”\\nFellow newcomer Bournemouth got off to a better start after Scott Parker won the battle of the former England midfielders as his team earned a 2-0 home win over Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa.\\nJefferson Lerma and Kieffer Moore scored either side of halftime at Vitality Stadium as Gerrard — who played alongside Parker at Euro 2012 — cut a frustrated figure for much of the afternoon.\\nHis expensively assembled team dominated possession in the south-coast sunshine but was toothless in attack.\\nAARONSON GIVES LEEDS A SPARK\\nThere was a distinct American flavor to Leeds’ 2-1 win over Wolverhampton at home.\\nU.S international Brenden Aaronson played a key part in the winning goal as he rushed in to meet a cross from Patrick Bamford, although it was credited as an own goal by defender Rayan Ait-Nouri, who tried to clear the ball only to poke it into his own.\\nLeeds went behind early when Daniel Podence scored for the visitors in the sixth minute with a volley that spun off the turf and in off the underside of the crossbar.\\nRodrigo leveled for the hosts in the 24th.\\nAaronson and fellow U.S. international Tyler Adams made their first starts for Leeds, which is managed by American coach Jesse Marsch.\\n“All the debutants did quite well,” Marsch told the BBC. ”(Aaronson) is relentless.

Deuba would not have even dared to bring the ordinance had Oli not done so last year. Oli would have moral grounds to oppose that even if Deuba had. Oli's acolytes who defended the ordinances last year or did not oppose them also do not have the right to oppose the ordinance brought by Deuba. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThose who had opposed the ordinances brought by Oli then have every right to oppose this ordinance now. And they must oppose this undemocratic step with determination. There should be no doubt that the axe Deuba has today taken to the House will not just hurt Oli but our democracy. It will ultimately undermine democracy.\\nParties are agents of democracy and democracy becomes weak if the agents become weak. Repeated disputes and splits in parties erode democracy. Frustrate the people. Inspire the anti-democratic forces and those who want to wind the clock back.\\nThe ordinance about splitting parties brought by Oli last year and Deuba now has undone the democratic reforms we started. This is unpardonable attack on democracy by both of them. There is a long background to the legal provision we now have about splitting parties. Nepali Congress (NC) nearly split during the first term of the House after restoration of democracy in 1990. There was a wave of splits in parties including UML, the then largest party in the House, during the second term. The then third largest party RPP split repeatedly. Horse trading of lawmakers and holding them hostage in hotels inside and outside the country started then. That instilled aversion toward the parliamentary system in the people.\\nThe situation worsened after the Jana Andolan II. The three Madhes-based parties elected to the First Constituent Assembly (CA) with a big mandate splintered into 18. There were over two dozen parties in the CA due to the proportional representation (PR) electoral system. Leaders of those small parties sold the PR seats to the highest bidders. \\xa0\\nThere was a strong demand and intense pressure from the public, the media and even inside big political parties to stop this wrong practice. We made two corrections in the law after the Constitution was promulgated in 2015. \\xa0\\nThe first is that a party must get at least three percent of PR votes, and win at least one seat in the first past the post electoral system (FPTP) to become a national party and to be eligible to get PR seats in the House. That limited the number of recognized national parties in the House to five even though it was 25 in the CA.\\nWe also made another improvement in the act about political parties. The act earlier had the provision allowing split of political parties with support of 40 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party. That was amended to make it require support of 40 percent in both the parliamentary party and the central committee to split any political party.\\nThis stopped the practice of winning the election on ticket of a party and later splitting the party by taking a fat sum or to become minister. No party has split in the current House after the provision came into force. CPN split into CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) on order of the Supreme Court.\\nThis ordinance brought by Deuba, however, has paved the way for UML to split. He has brought the ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of 20 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to serve his interest.\\nOli can oopt for revenge if he again comes to power in the future and bring an ordinance allowing split of political parties with support of just 10 percent in the central committee or the parliamentary party to engineer a split in NC or another party.\\nDeuba, who has been linked with almost all the wrong political practices since restoration of democracy in 1990 if he has not initiated those practices, will not have moral right to protest then like Oli now.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nOnce again, the issue of caste discrimination is dominating national conversation.\\nAmid an uproar over a journalist being denied a room in rent because of her caste and the subsequent intervention by a minister to get the landlord accused of such discrimination released, ideas and proposals on how to break away with such violations of national and human rights laws have been hitting the headlines.\\nA national campaign has been urged to end discrimination against Dalits and this is surely something worth considering but we need to reflect about the details, the contents and the overall goal of such proposal.\\nShould such campaign just be focused on the stigmas faced by citizens belonging to the Dalit community or instead have an enlarged “radar” and bring in also an attention on other groups within the society that have also been object of a pattern of discrimination on a consistent basis?\\nThink about many marginalized indigenous groups in the country. Think about members of the citizenry discriminated and abused because of their sexual orientation. Think about members of disability community or members of Muslim community or citizens from Madhes that have been often perceived as strangers.\\nYou surely also have sections of the so-called dominating groups with grievances as well.\\nThe more you think, the more you realize that discrimination in the country has been a constituent part of the old system that in many ways is still pervasive in so many aspects of daily lives.\\nMany positive changes happened but they are not enough.\\nIt is important to recognize this reality but inevitably this also brings about the issues of the so-called perpetrators, those who are perceived and seen as holding on to the ancient discriminatory status quo.\\nThis is an extremely delicate and sensitive issue and to better understand how divisive it can turn out, I spent considerable time reading about Critical Race Theory (CRT) and all the divisions that this subject, unintentionally or, for some, intentionally, is creating in the United States of America.\\nCRT is a broad area of studies that tries to understand how racism has permeated many aspects of the life in the United States, offering to explain how the ongoing discrimination against minorities there must be read through the prism of a system that for so many years was structurally designed to favor the white majority while intentionally leaving behind all the rest.\\nAcknowledging past historical injustices, recognizing how certain groups were discriminated in the name of a very limited and selective concept of freedoms and justice, principles applicable for so long just to certain members of the society, makes sense to me.\\nYet the process must be driven toward reconciliation and centered on a will to deal with the past without indiscriminate blaming of present and future generations belonging to certain groups that are accused for past injustices.\\nThe problems start when such attempts are, intentionally or not, used to create a wedge in the society, pitting whites versus African Americans, Latinos or Asian Americans or other members of minorities like native Americans who have been historically discriminated.\\nYou read about “weaponization” of the concept of race as many white Americans are strongly pushing back CRT teaching because they feel that such studies are portraying all whites as inherently racist.\\nOn the other side some members of the minority groups might be instead keen to ask not for reconciliation or healing but for revenge and this is extremely dangerous.\\nA reckoning with the past has become, at least for those pushing back against it, about group identities where individuals are risked to be judged not for their personal actions and behaviors but are considered as member of a certain racial groups.\\nIn a way, for many, the entire issue has not been about reconciliation but about white oppressors versus minorities being perennially oppressed.\\nThe issue is extremely complicated and inflammable as extremes on both sides of the equation might further polarize the issue, sowing more divisions.\\nI think that this long introspection in what’s happening in the USA is important for Nepal as well.\\nAs the country is extremely diverse and with many layers of discrimination still thriving in many people’s mindsets, it is essential to have a national conversation about diversity and discrimination faced by many citizens.\\nIt is about reflecting on hidden privileges and it is about realizing and admitting that a citizen’s status and position could have been influenced by certain norms and patterns that enabled one’s privileges at the expenses of others.\\nIt is true that the Constitution and laws are now strong enough to formally punish any acts of discrimination but this is not enough. Incidents like the one experienced by citizens being denied a room or apartment, would not happen if it were.\\nThat is why we need to have a national discussion centered around the issue of discrimination and injustices with the overall intent to ensure that such reckoning does not bring further division and bitterness as is happening in the USA.\\nFor sure it is something that would make someone uncomfortable and uneasy but this would be part of a process of national healing.\\nWe should not forget that after all, the Maoist insurgency here was initiated in the name of a better and more just country for all.\\nIt is essential that all members of the traditionally dominating groups realize that the game was not fair for many other members of the society that in the past could not even imagine themselves as equal peers.\\nOnly together, in the spirit of understanding, reconciliation and healing, a new pathway can be found for the country to emerge stronger and more just.\\nDealing with the past does not necessarily mean keeping on blaming some members of the society for the ways the system was structured in the past but it certainly implies an acknowledgement of it.\\nAny divisive issues like stronger quota systems and other positive discrimination measures should be discussed in a spirit of healing certain fault lines that do exist in Nepal as well.\\nSuch mechanisms should be decided and accepted wholeheartedly by those who might lose something out of them because they can be indispensable in creating a real level playing field in the country.\\nAs emotional as such conversation might be, a certain detachment will be needed to listen to each other and better understand all the sides of the equation. Only an exercise centered on deep listening and reflective silence will do the job.\\nWe need to create a multi-stakeholder coalition to fight against all kinds of discriminations but we need to make sure that the highest number of citizens, including those from the traditionally predominant groups, fully embrace such efforts.\\nDealing with discrimination starts with understanding, and understanding leads to reflections, and reflections bring to a process of self-realization.\\nAs a consequence, consciously or unconsciously, patterns of thinking and behaving might change and if this process is properly done, the changes will not cause a pushback like in the United States but a new beginning instead.\\nNepal can come up with its own way of dealing with the past and present injustices.\\nA prosperous nation can only thrive if the grievances of many and the concerns of others are discussed and wisely dealt with.\\nIn the United States the discussions are turning more and more divisive but in Nepal it could be an entirely different story.\\n(The author is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE.The opinions expressed here are personal.)\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nBrahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra. These are the four different labels that unequalize equally born humans. This article answers why and how society engraves these marks upon our identity.\\nBhardwaj, a prominent sage of the Mahabharat era asks another sage Bhrigu, \"What is it that distinguishes the Varna?\" Bhrigu opined, the Varna is a color-coded system. To this, Bhardwaj replied that, colors are seen among all Varnas; the sensation of desire, anger, fear, greed, grief, anxiety, hunger and toil prevails over all human beings; the flow of bile and blood happens in all human bodies, so how are they different? (Hiltebeitel Alf, Dharma: Its Early History In Law, Religion, And Narrative, 2011)\\nVarna is a Sanskrit word that literally translates into English as color or complexion. The Varna system is rooted in Hinduism but Dharmashastras and Upanishads are obscure about racial prejudice based on color. Different colors have been observed within the same Varna ruling out the possibility of distinction based on color. So, the same question arises time and again: ‘What actually distinguishes Varna?’\\nThe idea of Varna system has a long history and tradition dating back to Vedic times. Manusmiriti is considered one of the prominent historical texts that talks about the Varna Byabastha (i.e., system of Varna) in the Vedic era. The law of Varna teaches each one of us to earn our own bread by following the ancestral calling. Our ancestors divided themselves into different social classes which are today popularly known as Varnas or put more regressively, the ‘re-constructed castes’. Back then it defined not our rights but our duties. With the introduction of the Varna system, society was segregated into four major divisions. People who were associated with scholarly works and religious works were classified as Brahman. People who were good at administration and warfare were given the title of Kshatriya. People who were good at trade and businesses were called Vaishya. The laborers and service providers were called Shudra.\\nLord Krishna says in the twenty-seventh verse of the second chapter of the Bhagavad Gita that people of earth are classified into four Varnas on the basis of their \\'Guna\\' i.e., quality. The one who is wise, moral, virtuous, and manifests principles of proper conduct is \\'Sattoguni\\', thus called Brahman. Kshatriya is \\'Rajoguni\\' characterized by higher energy, passion, desire, and pain tolerance. They have the qualities of an administrator. Vaishya has mixed quality of \\'Rajoguni\\' and \\'Tamoguni\\'. Shudra is \\'Tamoguni\\', characterized by lethargy and ignorance.\\nIt is perplexing to trace the origin of the\\xa0Varna system. However, it is assumed that in the past, not everyone had the access to education and some privileged classes acquired knowledge and exerted power over the society. The four Varna system might be a new concept but the trend of class division is as old as humankind and has prevailed in almost every human civilization. In this regard, Winston Churchill correctly quotes that \"History is written by the victors and powerful people\". Long ago when the Varna system actually came into light, the then powerful people, the educated ones were involved in the paper and administrative works. By the virtue of the power they wielded, they classified people into four Varnas on the basis of the nature of their profession. Thus, the four Varnas; Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra, collectively known as Savarnas came into existence. There were other people called ‘Avarnas’ who were considered unworthy to fall under any of those four classes (Chandra et.al, India\\'s Struggle For Independence 1857-1947 (1989). In the present day, some Dalits and other backward castes fall under the category of \\'Avarnas\\'; deemed untouchables.\\nSome historians are convinced that the Varna system is solely formed on the basis of the nature of work, some claim it to be a color-coded system while others relate it to the Varnakram set by Dharmashatras. Although the historicity of Varna system is ambiguous, the exclusion of Avarnas is an evidence that the discrimination was practised even before the Varna system came into existence and somehow the discriminatory mindset of the privileged class was behind the introduction of this systematic oppression. This is supported by the fact that Vaishyas and Shudras were deprived of basic education and they had to indulge in the works requiring limited basic skills. It is an utmost truth that the Varna system was introduced by those who wielded the power at that time. The famous Irish Singer, Frank Harte was once quoted to have said, \"Those in power write the history, while those who suffer write the songs.\" It is obvious that the rulers reconstructed the society in such a manner that the hierarchy set by them would always favor them and they could continue ruling over the lower class people. Put simply, the Varna system was not solely divided on the basis of the nature of work and activities. There is a popular saying that “Works are not to be considered big or small, every kind of work is equal” but at the same time, the reason behind different people being discriminated is the nature of their work. The entire process of assigning a hierarchical position to profession ranging from honor to humiliation is the dissatisfaction that we carry against the Varna system. We eat the crops they harvest in the utensils they make but we hesitate to dine with them. But, this is not completely our fault, we are only doing what we have been taught by our parents. This is the stance we use in our defence when we are confronted with our discriminatory behaviour.\\nIn Nepal, it was King Jaysthiti Malla who systematized the caste system by introducing four Varnas and sixty-four Jaats. After the unification of Nepal, it was Prithvi Narayan Shah who modified the caste system into four Varnas and thirty-six Jaats. Whatever the intention may have been, it has always oppressed the so-called lower caste people systematically. In the present day Nepal, Dalits are routinely denied access to religious sites; they face resistance to inter-caste marriages; non-acceptance of water touched by Dalits and the list of discriminatory practices goes on. As stated earlier, this is the outcome of classifying and discriminating the work and profession itself. Among the four, Shudras are the critical sufferer of the Varna system because the nature of their work is considered derogatory in the books of our society. We have always turned away from the fact that the same work is feeding us and keeping us in a healthy environment. It is high time we understand that every work is meritorious and equal in status, as long as it is done with honesty, morality and lawfulness.\\nThe Varna system is not something that we should pass on to the next generation as an ornamental ancestral relic. In the present, people from all Varnas are doing all kinds of work. The segregation of work no longer exists. People of Shudra community are involved in scholarly works, administrative works and trade activities because now they too have access to education. Brahmans can do business activities and are doing too. Some so-called higher caste people are working as laborer and service-provider abroad while acting as the sole child of God in our own land. This proves that the disrespect for a profession has disappeared from our conscience but the social acceptance of the fact is yet to come.\\nLet us take a moment and have a good look around us, we see our society is changing slowly and gradually. It is not as orthodoxical as it was in the past. There is healthy acculturation of the works that were previously understood hereditary privilege. The children of Brahmans are not necessarily involved in religious works; Kshatriyas are not necessarily involved in administrative works; Vaishyas are not obliged to carry on their parent’s business, and Shudras are not meant to serve all. The ancestral family profession has shifted from being a compulsion to optional. The choice of our profession is upon us and living in a democratic society, choice is what matters the most. No one holds the power to assign class, put a\\xa0label or compel others to any profession. We lived in the past where the nature of our work determined our class and category but today our caste should not be the determining factor in our work.\\nGoing back to history, it has always been hypocritical in matters of the\\xa0Varna system. In the epic tale of Mahabharat, Bhisma forbade Karna from putting up a fight against Arjun because he belonged to a lower caste family and thus was supposed to work as a rider of a chariot as his father did. Considering Mahabharat not as mythology but as a history, it portrayed the then society where the rulers did not allow lower caste people to indulge in another profession. Society was run according to the will of people in power. Karna, being a Sut Putra (son of a chariot driver), was denied knowledge of armory by Dronacharya and was deprived of honor by Bhisma. But when King Shantanu, the father of Bhisma, fell in love with a fisherman’s daughter decades earlier, Bhisma was the one who lobbied for the marriage of a Kshatriya King and a fisherman’s daughter. Observing my society I understood that fishermen fall under the Vaishya\\'s category and Bhisma accepting Vaishya stepmother contradicts his own bias against Karna that deprived him of the respect he deserved due to his caste. This story clearly depicts the hypocrisy of the lawmakers who made the Varna system to give a new structure to the society but ultimately set the hierarchy so as to continue their rule over people below them.\\nIt is the ultimate truth of our society that casteism exists. The one who believes that there is no such thing as caste or Varna, is evidently living in denial. They are not ready to share their privileges with the so-called lower castes. To understand this thoroughly we need to visit the rural areas: My hometown is in the south-east of Jaleshwar Municipality in Mahottari District. People of different castes like Maithil Brahman, Bhumihar, Khatbe, Chamar, Kewat, etc. live there and all of them have their separate tole (colony). I was born and brought up there but it was only after my high-school, I realized my village has different colonies like Brahman Tole, Chamar Tole, Khatwe Tole, etc. A year ago when my grandfather passed away, according to the culture of tarai, we arranged feast for the villagers. When villagers arrived and the feast began, the people of all castes sat with their own caste only and avoided contact with the people of other castes. At first, it was surprising to me because I was living in ignorance as I believed that my villagers do not discriminate merely on the basis of caste but the ground reality was different and beyond my imagination.\\nThis is an example but not the only example. Recalling the Rukum incident where Navaraj BK and his friends were killed, it is prima facie evident that he was beaten to death because he belonged to the Dalit community and dared to fall in love with a girl of so-called higher caste. Our society is still filled with people who label us with a particular Varna at the moment we are born. Navaraj BK was killed because loving a girl is a sin in the eyes of our society and it is a bigger sin when the label of lower caste is engraved in our identity. It is an ignominy that a man gets killed for falling in love because he was a Dalit in the 21st century. Had he belonged to the higher caste he might have been alive today. This fact will haunt us as long as we unequalize equally born humans labelling them as Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras.\\nIn a democratic society, different people have different opinions and thus different ideologies become the factor for the evolution of different religions. I have a firm belief that religion is the product of ideology and faith. But, the Varna system or the caste system is nowhere the product of either ideology or faith even though the Varna system has its roots in the Sanatan (eternal) Hindu Dharma. The very first factor that played role in the division of Varna was the nature of work people practised and then gradually the discriminatory notions overtook the structure and it became a hereditary trait in due course of time.\\nSome people argue that discrimination is a very human thing, it has nothing to do with the\\xa0Varna\\xa0system but we cannot disagree with the fact that\\xa0Varna\\xa0system is the product of discrimination and vice-versa. In no way discrimination is a human thing, so let\\'s try our best to erase the predetermined notions set by\\xa0Varna\\xa0system and teach ourselves and our future generations that the Varna system was a privilege given to the already privileged class and, therefore, a burden to the lower class. Some say, it was revolutionary to give the new structure to the society and some people are of the view that it was the systematization of the class division with the flavor of discrimination. While the motive behind bringing the Varna system into practice is ambiguous, the discrimination it brought with needs to stop. It should not be passed on to the next generation.\\n(The author is a law student currently pursuing BALLB from Nepal Law Campus, Kathmandu)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nEvents like Education Minister Krishna Gopal Shrestha dropping the landlord who allegedly refused to lease a room to Rupa Sunar due to her caste need no explanation.\\nOne can understand the society being divided about how big a mistake the landlord's refusal to lease the room on the basis of caste is, and how some have taken this as a minor incident. One can also understand how some are angry that the woman, nearly 60, was locked up for three days and others sympathize with her. One can understand all these things in a society that has been mired in caste system for centuries and also understand arguments of some that it takes time to change the society. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe police had submitted the investigation file to the District Government Attorney Office which could have decided whether to take the case to the court or not if it were allowed to do its work fairly. The court could have then found the woman guilty or acquitted her. We all would and should have accepted the verdict.\\nBut the government hijacked the case that was in a judicial process. The District Government Attorney Office did not move the case forward citing lack of evidence and sent it back to the police for further investigation. Minister Shrestha went to the police station for release of the accused and dropped her home in his official vehicle fluttering the national flag.\\nIt's the words of Sunar against that of the woman in the case for now in lack of evidence and people are free to choose which side to trust. But the woman has not been acquitted by the court and the District Government Attorney Office, under pressure from the government, has only sent the file back for further investigation. And she still remains accused of the offense.\\nThe Constitution has explicitly prohibited any kind of discrimination on the basis of caste. Minister Shrestha appointed in accordance to the Constitution cannot use that position to solicit release of a person accused of an offense prohibited by the Constitution that he has sworn to while taking oath as a lawmaker and minister. He also cannot use the vehicle he got in capacity of the position as minister to drop the accused home. He also cannot flutter the national flag recognized by the Constitution to provide official endorsement for his abominable and unpardonable act.\\nIt is not hard to see why Minister Shrestha did that. The accused is a Newar woman and many naively say he stood for the Newar community. But we firmly believe that he did that for votebank politics and not for the Newar community. He would have stood for dozens of families who were rendered homeless in the name of road expansion in Balaju if he stood for the benefit of Newars. He was nowhere to be seen when the indigenous people in the Kathmandu Valley suffered from glottophobia for years. Where does he stand in the ongoing movement to conserve the culture and heritage of the Valley, and revive the Valley to its glorious ancient form? His action has once again revealed the age-old nature of opportunistic politicians to try to cash in on social disputes.\\nMinister Shrestha going to the police station in this manner is tantamount to the state, that should have stood up for the victim, standing against the victim. This is not just a question about Rupa Sunar but about caste discrimination that has dragged our society down for centuries. Many have similarly been denied rooms in the Valley. But this is still not an issue just of the Valley or a certain community. This is a representative story of the discrimination that dalits have faced for centuries. Around four million dalits across the country were looking at the issue with hope that they would for once get to experience that the equality granted by the Constitution is not merely an empty promise but actual right that can be exercised without any fear or retribution. Minister Shrestha has added insult to injury of these millions of dalits. The woman may be pardoned using myriad of arguments or acquitted by the court in lack of concrete evidence. But the crime that he has committed in capacity of the representative of the state cannot be pardoned. He deserves punishment for that. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe urge the prime minister and ruling CPN-UML to either fire Minister Shrestha or formally swear allegiance to the caste system. There will be no need to make noise expecting democracy and social justice from this dispensation after that. The dalits will also have no illusion about equality or expectation about social justice, and may perhaps disabuse themselves of the rosy interpretation of the Constitution.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe G7 summit held in person at Carbis Bay in the United Kingdom past weekend made for an interesting viewing from Nepal. Leaders of the seven rich and liberal democracies of the world frolicked maskless at the beach on the Atlantic coast even as virtually whole of Nepal is under prohibitory orders. The seven leaders, the majority of whom are over 65 years old with three septuagenarians and just two below 50, mingled without face masks even indoors and pledged more doses of vaccines to the global south. Indian Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, invited as a guest country, virtually addressed the summit sounding a clarion call\\xa0 for following a \"one earth, one health\" approach to effectively deal with the pandemic globally. Nepalis, rubbing their eyes in disbelief, watched the Indian media rave about how Modi lectured the world leaders about their collective responsibility toward tackling the pandemic globally. Some may even have felt that the leader with recent \\'sage\\' makeover has had an epiphany and would lift the export ban of vaccines at least in the immediate neighborhood. But there was no such epiphany alas and India has yet to relax export ban at the time of writing this editorial.\\nAll that frolicking and pomp was vulgar to see from Nepal where around 1.4 million older adults are hopelessly waiting for the second dose of Covishield vaccine over three months after getting the first one. Nepal started its vaccination campaign with the one million Covishield (AstraZeneca manufactured in India) doses donated by India just a few days after it was started in India. The government did not choose to inoculate the most vulnerable older adults with the doses remaining after inoculating the frontline health workers and opted to jab journalists, government staffers and bankers among others instead. Nepal opted for inoculating older adults only after paying Serum Institute of India for two million more doses and one million of them arrived. The government, despite all its ineptitude in handling the pandemic, was cautious even after the one million doses arrived and consulted the WHO before starting to vaccinate the older adults. It started to inoculate people above 65 years from the second week of March only after consent of the WHO. With well over one million doses in hand, advance payment already made to Serum for another one million doses and assurances that it will also receive its share of vaccines from the global vaccine alliance COVAX. Nepal even agreed to inoculate foreigners working in different diplomatic missions and international organizations in Nepal ahead of the older adults with assurances that there will be no shortage of doses. This was kind of generosity not even the developed countries showed toward foreigners at that time.\\nBut as the older adults started counting down the eight weeks they were told they had to wait for the second dose, the second wave hit India hard. Serum, on instruction of the Indian government, refused to deliver the one million doses Nepal had already paid for and also to COVAX as it was obliged to. The government requested New Delhi to at least provide enough for second dose to the older adults but to no avail. Serum has to supply the doses after taking advance payment for the sake of ethical business practice. The Modi government should allow export of the doses on humanitarian grounds if not for the millennia of special bread and daughter relation with Nepal that he repeatedly invokes. The quantity, that has become a matter of life and death for Nepali older adults, is almost irrelevant for a vast country like India. It is not even half of the Covishield doses that Serum manufactures each day on an average and can be easily offset by smoothening the supply chains inside.\\nThe older adults have to hopelessly wait even as the western media report that the delta variant, first seen in India and assumed to be the dominant even in Nepal, is significantly more contagious than other variants. Studies show that while two doses of AstraZeneca provide full protection against serious disease from delta variant, single dose provides significantly less protection against the variant than against the original virus. Britain initially had gambled to extend the gap for second dose of AstraZeneca from four weeks to 10-12 weeks to ensure more people have some level of protection instead of a fewer having complete protection and others no protection at all. But considering the significant risk of delta variant even for those receiving one dose, it has brought the gap to well below eight weeks. It is now rapidly inoculating younger Britons having all but finished vaccinating most vulnerable older adults.\\nIn this grim scenario, the only option the Nepal government has for the older adults if it doesn\\'t get AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccines is to provide two doses of Chinese or another vaccine. Some studies are being done in the West about giving Pfizer vaccine as the second dose after first dose of AstraZeneca and preliminary results show that such mixing indeed works. But the results are just preliminary and it will be too late for such mixing to be officially authorized for the vulnerable Nepalis who received the first dose three months back.\\nStarting a new kind of vaccine for the older adults would mean that 1.4 million doses of Covishield given as the first dose will be wasted. That would be unpardonable considering how precious and scarce the life-saving vaccines are. Nepal and India also have another kind of special relationship apart from the clichéd bread and daughter relationship Modi always invokes. Nepali men have fought for India for centuries and thousands have died protecting the Indian borders over the years. Thousands of Nepalis still serve in the Indian army. The Nepali older adults awaiting the second dose include many veterans who have served India in the past and may well be parents and grandparents of many who are currently serving the Indian forces. Not providing these doses would tantamount to wastage of all the one million doses donated by India and another 400,000 procured by Nepal.\\nIndia at least can point at the devastation wreaked by the second wave in defense of its vaccine nationalism. But the richer countries do not even have that excuse. America has tens of millions of AstraZeneca doses that it doesn\\'t intend to use. With the country securing enough doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines to inoculate the American people many times over, it has finally pledged to provide AstraZeneca to other countries. But it outrageously is waiting for approval of the Food and Drug Administration before supplying them to other countries despite it already being approved in those countries. America is the first country to have diplomatic relation with Nepal apart from British India and have invested billions in foreign assistance to Nepal over the years. It is baffling that America has not provided the AstraZeneca vaccines it won\\'t use to solve the humanitarian crisis in Nepal.\\nBritain, like India, has special relationship honed over centuries with Nepal. It is troubling that Britain is not doing anything to avert the humanitarian crisis by supplying AstraZeneca vaccines developed there. Thousands of Nepalis have died fighting for the British Empire since their colonial rule in India. Selling AstraZeneca vaccines to Nepal to inoculate the older adults would be a small gratitude for the tons of Nepali blood shed for the British cause. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0,\\nJapan is another example. It has ordered 120 million doses of AstraZeneca to be delivered by September that it will not use on Japanese people in all likelihood. It authorized use of AstraZeneca around three weeks back. But it has yet to start its use citing the very rare instances of blood clots and has already secured enough of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to inoculate those aged 16 or older. Japan has tremendous goodwill in Nepal despite not being an immediate neighbor or a global superpower and Nepali people consider it to be the only donor with no strategic interest in Nepal. It is regrettable that Japan sits top on the pile of AstraZeneca vaccines, many of them reportedly on verge of expiry, even as those above 65 here in Nepal are in this hopeless situation.\\xa0\\nThe communist government in its exuberance to please China may have rubbed Japan the wrong way in the past few years. There have also been murmurs from Japanese diplomats about the problem Japanese business folks face in repatriation of income generated here back to Japan. But that does not mean the Japanese diplomats, who have always been selfless friends for Nepal, should remain mere spectators to the humanitarian crisis unfolding here. We urge the Japanese Embassy to take initiative to allow Nepal to buy the AstraZeneca vaccines Japan does not intend to use if donating is too much to ask for in these troubled times.\\nThe United Nations and health experts have been repeatedly pointing that no one is safe from this virus until everyone is safe but the rich countries despite paying lip service to that have been shamelessly practicing vaccine nationalism. It is criminal on part of rich countries to outbid and elbow out poorer countries with non-existent health infrastructure to secure enough vaccines to inoculate their people many times over and then allow the spare doses expire unused. It is obscene to bribe younger adults with joints and beer for vaccine when the pandemic has already waned there while even the frontline health professionals and the older adults in poorer countries in the midst of a surging pandemic cannot get the jab.\\nVaccine delayed, like justice, is vaccine denied. But better late than never. The pledge of G7 to secure a further one billion vaccine doses for other countries over the next 12 months primarily through COVAX is welcome. But more is needed and needed today, not the next year as WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rightly says.\\xa0 \"There are enough doses of vaccines globally to drive down transmission and save many lives, if they are used in the right places, for the right people,\" he stressed speaking after the G7 announcement. There are more than enough doses of unused AstraZeneca vaccines on verge of expiry around the world to provide second dose to the older Nepali adults. The international community with their collective conscience buried under the piles of unused surplus vaccines owe at least that much to Nepal.\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe ever-increasing trade deficit of Nepal has crossed Rs 1 trillion. Balancing the economy has always remained a challenge for the government and having trade surplus remains a distant dream. The government recently announced a controversial plan to export sand, gravel, rocks and other materials to India to balance the trade deficit. This invited heavy criticism from all quarters including the political parties, environmentalist, and the non-governmental sector among others. Though the government denies that mining will be carried out in the Chure region, there is a big ethical question on whether or not to extract resources from any specific geographical region.\\nThe vulnerability \\nMining certainly has some implications on the environment at local and regional scales. Any alterations upstream will bear upon the natural settings downstream, especially if the physiography is relatively fragile. This is the exactly the case of Chure region of Nepal which is unique in terms of its geology, geomorphology and ecology. Geologically it is the youngest mountain of the Himalayas comprising of unstable slope and unconsolidated rocks. The tarai section of the Chure is already prone to flooding and inundation. Chure Master Plan, the most comprehensive document so far for Chure management, shows that about 89,797 hectares of Chure falls under highly vulnerable category in terms of flooding and inundation. Likewise, 145,794 hectares falls in the moderately vulnerable category. With lack of management and unregulated mining, there is a risk of additional areas being pushed to the vulnerable category. These geo-hazards are further exacerbated by recent but unprecedented anthropogenic pressures like forest encroachment and degradation, uncontrolled grazing, forest fire, uncontrolled excavation of sand, gravel and boulders from rivers and streams in the Chure.\\nAmong the several activities, mining in the rivers has remained the most contested issue over the past several years. Records show that there are 242 mining sites across 27 districts of Chure region. In addition, 136 potential mining areas have been identified. The reason for this scale of expansion of the industry is perhaps the revenue that governments collect. Statistics show that the Bagmati province alone collected over Rs 1 billion in revenue from the local government, majority of which came from mining taxes. The lucrative nature of this business has not only convinced the government to allow mining, it has rather promoted illicit collection and export across the border.\\nThe illegal extraction has not only altered the topography of the Chure region including the downstream, millions of lives are in danger due mainly to their exposure to flooding events. Estimates show that 14 million inhabit the Chure region. Not limited to this, about millions of people live in the Gangetic plains, meaning any environmental modifications made in Chure will have a direct implication to far south in the Indian territories.\\nThe Chure Master Plan has explicitly highlighted the fact that the initial environmental assessments are not adequately followed and that monitoring and regulation is equally weak. It further stresses that the amount of materials drawn exceeds the actually permitted amount. Technically, the rate of excavation of such mines should not exceed that of the rate of deposition. This has particularly been happening close to expanding market areas. For instance, areas close to urban centers likeTinau of Rupandehi, and certain areas in Bara and Dhanusha districts are a few examples of soaring mining activities, some in illicit ways.\\nEnvironmental impacts\\nStudies have shown that over extractions can have an array of environmental impacts. That ranges from impacts on the aquatic ecosystem, loss of land mass due to erosion, disruption in the waterflows thus triggering water currents, damages to infrastructures including bridges, all of which undermines the protection against flooding events.\\nThe argument that extraction of gravels and boulders is reasonable as long as the sand/sediment budget and the hydraulic information is adequately considered. Indiscreetly, mining in Nepal has lacked scientific discernment compounded by the lack of capacity on part of the local bodies and administration to conduct environmental assessments and regular monitoring. Not only has this motivated over extraction of the resources, illegal collections and export across the border is rife. Dozens of illegal mining and export remains unreported across Nepal. This shows the lack of capability of the government to regulate the collection, thus in contradiction to its claim to sustainable extraction. Attack on the journalist reporting on illegal sand extraction in Abu Khaireni of Gorkha district, and murder of Prakash Mahato, an environmental activist protesting the illegal extraction in rivers of Dhanusha, on January 2020 are manifestations of the illegality in this industry.\\xa0\\nThe question on sustainable mining\\nThe demand for sand and gravel is ever increasing in the Indian territory. Even the major cities and peri-urban areas on the Nepali side has witnessed rapid expansion thus giving thrust to development priorities. With ever increasing demand for development materials, regulating the supply demand chain is a big challenge. Citing rising cases of illegal and unstainable mining, parliamentary committee had instructed to ban the export and mining in the Chure region in 2010 warning that the denudation would soon turn tarai to a desert. Nevertheless, imposition, and ease in the ban largely remains in the discretion of political leadership.\\xa0\\nDespite periodic bans on illegal mining from rivers, these go largely unchecked and unregulated in Nepal. Previous studies have highlighted the fact that the maps identified for mining in the initial environmental assessment reports is different from areas where extraction is actually done. More alarming is that in some cases, in defiance of the assessment reports, extractions have been carried out in areas that are flood prone and under risk of river bank erosion.\\nThe expansion of tools and technology in the domains of mining is testimony to this flourishing industry. Records show 458 crusher industries operating across 37 districts. In 2017-2018 alone, excavators and shovel loaders worth Rs 19 billion were imported to Nepal. With this extractive policy, the questions always remain about sustainable mining.\\n\\xa0A transboundary issue\\nThe impacts of mining can be traced beyond borders and in some cases leaves serious repercussions. For instance, Singapore is ravenously expanding its land over the seas. It is doing this through importing sand, gravel and other materials from neighboring states. The impacts of the sand export have already manifested in various countries but most notably is the disappearance of over 20 sand islands in Indonesia alone.\\nThe point is there is never a limit to the demand over such resources. With neighboring states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in India expanding rapidly, the demand for resources keep shooting up. Over 30 districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh usually suffer from flooding that emerge from the Nepali territory. That means India is also not spared from the detriments of the Nepali land, most importantly the Chure. As long as the mining and export ARE not checked through policies, regulations and effective oversight, there is always a likelihood of overexploitation. This would be more effective through concerted efforts of the governments across regions. Unsustainable mining across the Chure and the impacts it has across Nepal and the Indian territory demands for a joint effort. Joint assessments, monitoring, and conservation efforts between the concerned agencies in Nepal and India would equally be important to minimize the impacts of Chure degradation.\\n(Karki is a researcher and Dr Paudel a senior researcher at Forest Action Nepal)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNepal’s mountains and rivers are often praised as heavenly assets that attract tourists—foreign as well as domestic. However, Nepal as a country, which is located along the seismically active tectonic plate, lies in one of the world’s most disaster-prone territory. Given the topographical fragility of its steep terrain and young geology of Himalayas as well as ferocious rivers during monsoon, human settlements in their vicinity are exposed to recurrent disaster-hazards. Moreover, deforestation, haphazard extraction of Chure, lack of sustainable engineering on road construction, impacts of climate change, unplanned human settlements, weak channeling of budgets allocated for disaster mitigation efforts, dams, embankments and other structures built by India along the border as well as Nepal’s lack of diplomatic acumen to resolve this issue with India through talks, have aggravated the disaster risks.\\nIt is unsurprising that Nepal, every year, records a massive loss of lives and property worth hundreds of million rupees to various disasters during monsoon. Besides, common monsoon disasters such as landslides, mudslides, lightning, flash floods, and inundations among others destroy critical infrastructures like roads, utility poles, schools and hospitals among others, leaving human settlements in peril, in many cases even out of humanitarian assistance. According to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, last year alone between April and October, monsoon disasters claimed at least 463 lives—the biggest single-year casualty since the devastating earthquake of 2015—while as many as 803 persons were injured, 101 others went missing and property worth Rs 797.5 million was lost.\\nNepal has continuously devised pre-disaster preparedness and disaster management mechanisms in tandem with international partners and local agencies over the years. In current federal restructuring, Disaster Risk Reduction and Management (DRRM) Act (2017) has made it clear that the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Authority (NDRRMA) is the apex agency under the Home Ministry to work on all natural disaster risks management cycle—preparedness, response, rescue operation, recovery, relief or mitigation efforts—in coordination with local and provincial governments across the nation. Also, NDRRMA has to coordinate with the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology and the Department of Mines and Geology in terms of disaster warning systems to disseminate early alert messages to the public.\\nAccording to the rules, local levels, district disaster bodies, provincial bodies and national-level authorities are required to coordinate with each other to prepare the reports on disaster risks and mitigation efforts following the bottom-up approach. Based on a database of these annual reports, higher level authorities devise national plans at the end for disaster mitigation efforts which could be channelized throughout the three tiers of the government to tackle the disaster risks.\\nThere is, however, still a huge coordination and communication gap among intra-governmental, non-governmental and private humanitarian agencies at all levels. Further, lack of clarity on how roles and responsibilities are shared among them has added to the woes.\\nMost distressingly, the efficacy of our disaster risks mitigation mechanism is questionable when it comes to enhancing disaster resilience capabilities of the hazard-prone communities.\\xa0 When a community is faced with calamities like landslides, floods and inundation, there are always the most pressing concerns about potential loss of lives, economic impacts and untoward psycho-social repercussions. However, in terms of most monsoon disasters, landslides in the vicinity of weak hills and high hills as well as floods on the river bank settlements are always predictable in many cases. Such hazard effects can be remarkably prevented or mitigated with coordinated community mobilization. But we have largely failed to strengthen the abilities of communities to take meaningful, deliberate and collective actions both to prevent disasters and reduce the disaster impacts. We should understand the fact that if communities are resilient, they can come forward with strong civic leadership, coordinate with each other to engage in prevention efforts as well as generate organizational linkages to withstand disaster impacts such as social, cultural, economic including psycho-social support during the crisis.\\nThis is mainly due to the fact that our disaster preparedness efforts are only focused on response soon after catastrophes befall. Throughout the year, all authorities remain almost non-functional and resort to dirty blame games when disasters wreak havoc on human societies. Even in the wake of disaster, they lack coordinated actions to extend the humanitarian services to the victims and relocate them to safer places.\\xa0 What happened to Sindhupalchok and Baglung landslides victims last year is just the tip of the iceberg. Had the authorities responded on time, such a huge loss of lives and property as well as psychological impacts could have been significantly averted.\\nFurthermore, owing to the unscientific human settlement patterns and inflexible land use policy in the nation as well as inaction on the part of government agencies to respond with long-term relocation plans, communities are compelled to hastily reconstruct poor shelters on the same lines where disasters normally hit year by year. This only spares hazard-prone communities to witness another year’s catastrophes.\\nWith this year’s monsoon around the corner and increased vulnerability of disaster-prone communities due to the pandemic crisis, it is utterly necessary to learn lessons from the past experiences and adopt the most possible pragmatic approaches to reduce the disaster risks.\\nIt is clear that the hilly districts sitting in the Siwalik, Mahabharat range, Mid-land as well as higher Himalayas are more vulnerable to landslides owing to their steep topography and fragile ecosystem while communities within the basin of snow-fed perennial rivers such as Koshi, Narayani, Karnali, and Mahakali among other southern rivers are always at higher risks of floods and inundation.\\nDisaster preparedness remains an urgency to mitigate the plight of people in disaster-prone communities in hills and low-lands where natural disasters are invariably recurrent phenomenon with incessant rainfall in monsoon causing flash floods and landslides. Timely communication, coordinated efforts and dedicated actions among all levels of government agencies, humanitarian agencies, national security apparatus, private partners and communities are fundamental to strengthening life-saving approaches both before and after the catastrophes befall.\\nMoreover, this is also the prime responsibility of media to educate communities to enhance their disaster resilience capabilities and keep them alert on possible disaster threats.\\nEqually important is communities’ awareness to be prepared with disaster supply kit contents that include essential items such as stock of food that requires no cooking or refrigeration, safe drinking water, clothing, and first aid tools as well as necessary medication to sustain a family at least for a few days. This will help ease the disaster challenges that are often faced by vulnerable populations such as children and older adults including women, patients and differently-abled individuals. As each life is precious, it is never good to be unprepared for the worst that this year’s monsoon may impose on us.\\n(The author is currently an MPhil scholar at Nepal Open University)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe world is currently experiencing the threat of COVID-19, which has affected 220 countries and territories. Being a Himalayan country with complex landscapes, lax quarantine systems, under-resourced health care and public health systems, less capacitated diagnostic facilities, and a long open border with India, Nepal is on the brink of health care failure and severe risk from COVID-19 pandemic. The risk has already been evinced by severe outbreaks of COVID-19 in Nepal that ranks 18th\\xa0 in active cases, 41st in total cases,\\xa0 and 51st in total deaths (as of May 31). However, the data is supposed to be underestimated due to limited testing, and lack of case tracing are common in Nepal.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nSome measures were adopted initially to prevent the COVID-19 outbreaks, such as nationwide lockdown, closure of academic institutions and all entertainment and sports avenues, implementing travel restrictions from affected countries and borders. However, all of those measures were poorly implemented; Nepal experienced growing cases of COVID-19 despite being controlled. Reviewing the global scenario shows the COVID-19 outbreaks have been linked to the country’s public health, economic, political, and social systems. Thus, these systems should be understood to determine the appropriate preventive and therapeutic strategies of the pandemics.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of the country's health system, inequalities, and poor governance. The second wave likely driven by B.1.617.2 variant, that is reported to be highly contagious, aggressive, and fatal, has led to mass fear on the Nepali people. As of April 30, 2021, all of the as intensive care unit (ICU) wards in all of the private and public hospitals were already occupied with serious cases of COVID-19. It is a pity to see that healthcare workers provide their best services to COVID-19 patients despite being infected themselves. Many city hospitals have already run out of the necessities such as ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen, and drugs used in COVID-19 treatment. Hospitals close to Indian border have experienced massive cases of COVID-19, and this harbingers the worst situation in future if further integrated activities are not performed soon. This has been aggravated by flocking of a large number of people from India into Nepal through the porous borders, and the government not being able to control such movements. This has raised a serious threat to the introduction of new viral strains into Nepal. There is no hope of health facilities including PCR tests and others for the rural and disadvantaged people, especially in the high altitude areas with difficult landscapes. These are the underlying causes why COVID-19 patients are not traveling to the hospitals and thus are hidden from the government statistics. One can argue that overwhelming hospital attendance, strained and exorbitant health system, health services fatigue, and the resource constraints predict an even worse situation in the coming days.\\n\\xa0Who is to blame?\\nThe main question regarding the second wave is who was to blame. Health workers and public health experts had already warned the government of the possible tsunami of the COVID-19 due to new viral variants. They urged the government to ramp up efforts to upgrade hospitals, arrange ICU beds, and get vaccines. Although COVID-19 Crisis Management Center (CCMC) frequently advised the government to take precautions, plans, programs, and policies related to the future outbreak, the government turned its blind eye to engage experts and use data and science and follow the public health advice. On January 28, 2021, when no death was reported for the first time after the start of first wave, health care authorities and government believed the COVID-19 epidemic was under control, were complacent, and did not prepare for possible future outbreaks. Thus, the government did not carry out border lockdown for Nepali workers and people celebrating religious/cultural events returning from India or Indian people who flew from Kathmandu to other countries by air. From the first COVID-19 wave, the government was busy concentrating on other political affairs such as infighting in the ruling party, dissolution of parliament, demonstration of power via rally, restructuring Cabinet at the central level, toppling the governments at the provincial level, and lobbying to pass the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) Compact. The opposition parties also did not care about the pandemic as thousands of their cadres also participated in rallies and programs. While the government prohibited gathering of more than 25 people, the prime minister himself attended many public events for inauguration, political speech, and religious ceremonies, surrounded by hundreds of mostly unmasked people. In addition, politicization, false information, rumors, claims, and advocacy in social media fuelled the non-compliance, conspiracy theorists urged the general people to not follow the preventive and control measures against COVID-19. For example, PM KP Sharma Oli's hearsay regarding guava leaf therapy, turmeric powder therapy, spicy therapy, and the so-called theory of naturally immune Nepalis do not have any scientific pieces of evidence. It was highly criticized by politicians and non-aligned scientists. However, he blamed Nepali people for their negligence when the second wave hit, and then, he touted his government, claiming everything is under control, indicating his hunger for self-ennoblement. In the meantime, there are reports of corruption in the purchase of essential medical supplies and vaccines against COVID-19. This has resulted in the growing anxiety and frustration among citizens regarding the government’s healthcare and economic response to the pandemic. Therefore, the PM seems to defend his government, hiding its moral failure, apathy, incompetence, and corruption regarding COVID-19 control.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNevertheless, it was a welcome move of the government to make a plan to inoculate all of its citizens by the end of April 2021 beginning the vaccination campaign in January. \\xa0As of March 15, 2021, 1.6 million people or less than 6 % of the eligible population had received single dose of vaccine while more than a million older adults have not got their second dose of Covishield well over two months after receiving the first. It was interesting that when PM Oli was machinating to dissolve the House, the US Senate Foreign relations Committee discussed about vaccine shortage in Nepal. The recent announcement of Chinese President Xi Jinping to provide a million doses of vaccines to Nepal indicates a critical worry advocated about Nepal by the emerging leaders around the globe. \\xa0\\nRecommendations \\nWhile the second wave is engulfing the country, Nepal should fight with it based on scientific evidence and medical experiences. First, it should learn a lesson from the experiences of countries like New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Israel, and others on how to effectively apply control and preventive measures and promote equitable vaccine distribution. Policy, which prioritized economy rather than public health in few countries like USA, India, Brazil, and others, led to the failure. Therefore, efficient and wise leadership in the current situation in Nepal is mandatory. Second, considering its capacity, Nepal should focus and invest more in the early detection, identification, and containment of viruses at the community level in all seven provinces. For this, the central government should mobilize the microbiologists, biotechnologists, zoologists and health workers via a fast-track employment system and work with health centers at the local level. Third, the government should welcome and facilitate travel permits for those individuals, groups, charities, or organizations who want to support COVID-19 patients as well as other patients. Thousands of Nepali people are volunteering delivery of the patients to the hospitals and providing primary care or quarantine centers, oxygen cylinders, antibiotics, and drugs. For this, Nepali people around the world are also playing essential roles. Fourth, a healthy collaboration of the government with different line ministries, different political parties, and prompt application of the advice given by the CCMC is essential. Awareness programs regarding vaccine hesitancy and COVID-19 management via proper use of media are critical and can be conducted by following the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Fifth, the government should have aggressive contact tracing, epidemiological and molecular studies to better understand circulating variants and their epidemiological features and to implement effective control measures.\\nNepal should also talk to authorities in India about the establishment of temporary isolation centers and the closure of border entry. Sixth, in vitro as well as in vivo research using natural products, drugs, and vaccines related to the treatment and preventive strategies of COVID-19 should be conducted. Seventh, the government should implement mass vaccination as well as non-pharmaceutical interventions such as universal masking and social distancing, which have been proven successful in controlling the viral spread. It would also be better to provide alternative approaches such as deferring the second dose to accelerate and maximize vaccination coverage to the susceptible population, as practiced first in Britain. Eighth, a 'vaccine passport' or 'e-vaccination certificate' should be regulated at least at the international airport so that only the fully vaccinated individuals are allowed to enter the country. Finally, Nepal, whose current health expenditure per capita is only US$ 45.5 needs the international community including the WHO to help her combat the pandemic. How successfully Nepal defeats COVID-19 depends on the responsible leadership and public health interventions by the government.\\n(Dr Acharya is Veterinary Officer at the Animal Quarantine Office and Dr Ghimire Assistant Professor at the Department of Zoology, Tri-Chandra Multiple Campus)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nHarvard professor Steven Pinker, in a scholarly deliberation, subtly describes the reasons behind political rhetoric tending to be “vague, empty and bland”. For this, not only the politicians but also the audiences play their part equally as both are hypocritical in political messaging. It is because, he says, “there is firestorm when the leaders speak substantive”. In our context we can imply that a leader would not be able to draw attention of voters or people or win their support if s/he speaks reality in terms of what actually s/he can perform or is performing. To fill this void s/he speaks tall promises, vague and empty ideas that look like real with a lot of glitter to generate wow from the audience. The media, instead of focusing on substantive information, always “yearns for spotting gaffes the politicians commit when there is not horse race”, Pinker further observes. Framing and spin-doctoring techniques are widely applied in generating and spreading unsavory ideas as part of the political rhetoric, he argues.\\nRhetorical tricks\\nIf we minutely go through Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s political steps and subsequent communicative actions, it would be pellucid how rhetorical tricks have entirely corroborated the actions taken to secure his stay in power and capture all state machinery including constitutional bodies. Knowingly or unknowingly the media and the audience have been the prey of incessant logical fallacies from Oli and his entourage. Unless we realize this communication perspectives of today’s polity, which is truly represented by PM Oli and his cortege among others, our efforts to cope any undemocratic move would be unavailing.\\xa0\\nNepal’s republic system has so far witnessed eight PMs and two presidents. History would judge their distinctive traits and performances. All chief executives shared some short of common traits as to compromising democratic values and delivering below par, although to a varying degree. Oli, however, has painted a discrete picture, though not pleasant. When assuming the top office three years ago, Oli’s aura as the premier of almost two-third majority and as a chair of historically the biggest communist party of the country was astounding. In the beginning, the design of development and prosperity he mapped out were worth drawing attention to for every single Nepali who was either working as a blue-helmet worker in a gulf country or suffering from multiple problems ranging from unemployment to social injustices here at home.\\nInitially, many compelling ideas and slogans Oli articulated one after another kept on beating the media headlines. He orchestrated different strategies to establish what he had done was right and up to the mark. Later on after people began to seek true delivery from his administration rather than lofty promises, he gradually either ignored or diluted his failed attempts by attributing to other factors such as opponents in his party or foreign elements. While he busied himself to meet foreign agents, enhance his propaganda drives and take steps accordingly, he, side by side, accused his opponents of using these weapons against him. If we look at the shreds of political moves taken by Oli we can find a spiral of attempts he made to justify his every other step.\\xa0 As part of his attempts to create his self-respect and urgency in the power, he opted for two weapons. First was the announcement or initiation or inauguration of developmental projects, almost all of which were devoid of substantiated foundation or progress or far behind from completion. Second was the rhetorical tricks he and his team used to justify his every move through various types of logical fallacies. Essentially, this article focuses on the communication traits he and the President’s Office made to justify the dissolution of the parliament and announcement of the elections on November 12 and 19.\\nEither me or nobody attitude \\nOli uses a lot of emotional appeals with selected phrases and imageries that can evoke a sense of urgency or compulsion in his action. Other contemporary leaders look diminutive to Oli in utilizing humor and wits. Side by side, he, at times, uses threats eliciting a sense of fear that the country and democracy will fail if his path was not adopted. How can going for the fresh mandate when no one is being able to garner required support to form a new government be autocratic move? Apparently, this question he put forth looks plausible for general audience. However, there are numerous counter questions that invalidate his idea: Is going to election by violating the letter and spirit of the Constitution appropriate? Can elections be held in free and fair manner when he has managed to take state organs including the constitutional bodies into his grip? Is it the right time to go for elections when the entire country is unprecedentedly suffering from a pandemic (COVID-19) when the parliament still has nearly two more years to complete its tenure? Instead of addressing these questions rightly, he and his team members are now busy to dilute them with ersatz ideas and partial or misrepresented truths.\\nFollowing the House dissolution, Oli, in a press meet, said that he opted for the dissolution, for the opposition alliance could neither form the government nor did it support him by giving him vote of trust in the parliament. He also tried to justify his move saying that he wanted to clear the way to form a new government under Article 76(5). His arguments do not carry any merit as they contradict on what he did in real action. Not only did he claim for new government under his leadership under the same Article for which he had “cleared the way for new government”, he also created a pseudo situation that led him to dissolve the parliament and go for elections. Oli, for this, adopted two tactics: presenting claims to the president that he has the support of required number of parliament members and creating a pseudo situation where the president could invalidate the claims of both the candidates—Oli himself and leader of the opposition alliance Sher Bahadur Deuba. Instead of clearing the way for the new government, these tactics cleared the way for himself to invoke the Article 76(7) for dissolving the parliament and go for mid-term polls–his ultimate goal to cling on to power and vanquish his opponents.\\nPresident Bidya Devi Bhandari’s logic that some of the lawmakers’ support to both the candidates made her invalidate both the candidates clearly appeared to be shallow and unfounded. Essentially, Deuba had appeared with signatures of more than the required numbers of lawmakers whereas Oli had just made the claim that he has the support from more than the required members by ignoring the fact that a significant number of the lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and Janata Samajbadi Party had already revolted from their respective parties and supported Deuba. As the protector of the Constitution, Bhandari was supposed to verify the signatures by taking some time to clear her doubts so that the House of Representatives could be saved. Instead of bothering to fulfil this duty by taking some time, she dissolved the parliament and announced the fresh polls on Oli’s recommendation. It is obvious that she just served Oli’s interest by trampling all merits and reasoning against the move.\\nBR Ambedkar, after India’s Constitution was drafted under his leadership, said, “. . . however good a Constitution may be, it is sure to turn out bad because those who are called to work it, happen to be a bad lot. However bad a Constitution may be, it may turn out to be good if those who are called to work it, happen to be a good lot.” Nepal is now going through a situation when the current lot (bad lot) in the power is solely responsible for the ongoing political turmoil and focus on politicking rather than devastating pandemic.\\nFighting evil spirits\\nOli will be remembered as a chicanery chief executive of democratic federal republic Nepal as he managed to use tricks and deceits in justifying his actions and create a false reality. Some of such traits comprised spending a lot of time, mostly in his almost solo deliberations, with preferably the media and journalists lenient to him; tactfully framing phrases that apparently show his actions taken either out of compulsion or urgent need of time; attacking opponents with abhorring, stinging, sardonic and belittling comments and analogies; parroting political rhetoric such as nationalism, national interest, democracy, transformation, corruption-free society in speeches but acting against them in actuality. The political parties need to revamp their internal system and nourish democratic exercise so that wrong people would not prevail to not let the history repeat itself. Emboldening public opinion against any such pernicious character from the politics is equally important. This demands efforts, either concerted at organizational level or at individual level; from the media, civil society members, research organizations and academics.\\nFighting the evil spirits is no doubt tough as they are well-equipped with resources and their dogmatic supporters or ‘cyber troops’ through which they attack the opponents and whistleblowers or dilute the facts against their interest. However, it is not impossible as we all citizens can ventilate our voice through various communication channels. Since we don’t have to wait for or rely on others to make our voices heard as we are readily accessible to various communication channels with enormous intensity of diffusion, we can hone these weapons, wield them against the wrongdoers and attack them by spreading facts, exposing their self-serving tricks, creating debates over the merits and demerits of public affairs and carrying out valid researches from academic and other sectors. As Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. once said “it’s really clear that the most precious resource we all have is time”. We are living in the time of highly sophisticated communication and technology through which we can work a lot to demolish any despot. So, let’s beware of glittering claims, cunningly framed speeches or stories and doctored information. Let’s not forget that the time is ours!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nPrime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has again attacked the Constitution and democracy after his first blow on December 20, 2020 failed. The motive is clear—to shred the Constitution into pieces and derail democracy.\\nHe has full support of President Bidya Devi Bhandari in this motive. Not merely support, both of them are together in this motive.\\xa0 President Bhandari, therefore, threw away the written application submitted by\\xa0 149 House of Representatives (HoR) members to form an alternative government as per the constitutional provision on Friday, and dissolved the HoR on recommendation of Oli.\\nThe flimsy arguments President Bhandari used to usurp the constitutional rights of 149 lawmakers makes her motive clear. Issuing a statement in the midnight, she claimed that their claims were unjustified taking help of the false claims made by Oli. Oli had sent a letter to the President less than 24 hours earlier saying he has paved the way for formation of new government pointing he does not have confidence of the House.\\nShe issued the notice saying claims of both Oli and Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba are unjustified pointing at the false claims of Oli that he now has majority. She reasoned that the supporting lawmakers are repeated on both sides, they have supported candidate of another party against the party's decision, and the parties concerned have written to not recognize their signatures.\\nThese arguments are false and baseless. First and foremost, President Bhandari's claim that the names of supporters are repeated is a blatant lie. None of the 149 lawmakers who signed to make Deuba the new PM have signed in favor of Oli. Oli rather had submitted a false letter lying that he has full support of all 121 CPN-UML lawmakers and 32 Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP) ones. Thirty-eight out of those 153 had signed in support of Deuba.\\nSo much so that Oli implied that UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal and JSP leaders Upendra Yadav and Baburam Bhattarai, who were present in person while submitting the application supporting Deuba to President Bhandari, supported him.\\nAny lawmaker can sign supporting any other lawmaker who wishes to become PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution. This provision has been kept in Article 76(5) of the Constitution precisely to ensure that any lawmaker who can muster support of majority lawmakers can form the government after the majority government, coalition government of two or more than two parties, and minority government of the largest party in the House all fail. If party whip were to be binding, there would be no meaning of keeping Article 76(5) of the Constitution.\\nThe logic that President Bhandari gave pointing that Deuba could not be appointed PM as lawmakers have supported candidate of another party against the parties' decision, and the parties concerned wrote requesting her to not recognize those signatures, therefore, is groundless.\\nLet us assume for a while that a lawmaker cannot support lawmaker of another party or an independent candidate without decision of the party concerned even under Article 76(5) of the Constitution, and the party whip is valid and the Act related to political parties is attracted.\\nA lawmaker can defy the party whip not just in the context of Article 76(5) of the Constitution, but in election under any other article of the Constitution, or any other issue. That is counted as a valid vote in the House. That vote is not annulled. A lawmaker always has that right as a sovereign representative elected by the people.\\nThe lawmaker definitely can be punished for defying the party whip, and can even lose the post of lawmaker as per the Act related to political parties. But there is no provision in the Constitution or any law in Nepal that stops a lawmaker from voting defying the party whip, or annuls the vote so cast.\\xa0\\nEven if the lawmaker who signed in support of the lawmaker to be appointed PM under Article 76(5) of the Constitution were later to be punished in accordance to the law, our Constitution or law of the land does not grant any right to the President to reject the vote cast when the person is legally a lawmaker.\\nShe could have verified authenticity of the signatures if she had any doubt. She could have even summoned those lawmakers to march at the President's Office within 24 hours and asked them to sign in person to establish whether the majority of lawmakers supported Oli or Deuba.\\nBut she did not want to do that because that would have exposed Oli's lies. That step would have been against the motive she shared with him.\\nThe whimsical attitude of Oli would have largely been reined in if President Bhandari had followed the system right from the beginning and complied with the Constitution. She continued to further nurture his growing whimsical attitude instead. She is, therefore, one of the main reasons behind the the current whimsical nature of Oli and his habit of taking arbitrary decisions on whims.\\nWe should also not forget there is a very strong external dimension to the path against the Constitution and democracy that Oli has taken. It will metastasize further the more we delay to understand and publicly challenge that. Many had suspected right from the beginning that the outside hand was in play in dissolution of the HoR even on December 20. The maneuverings of the external powers have come to the fore after the House was reinstated.\\nThey are openly operating to keep Oli in power in recent times. They first advised the main opposition NC to not form an alliance against Oli and later resorted to threatening language. They did everything to woo, threaten and split JSP lawmakers to support Oli. Why are they doing all this for Oli? \\xa0\\nChief of the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) of India Samant Goel had arrived on an Indian Air Force plane while Nepal was in lockdown seven months back. He had a meeting with PM Oli at Baluwatar in the midnight without any representative of the Foreign Ministry. Records of even telephonic conversations of the US President with a foreign head of the state or government are kept. The records of the in-person meetings of US President with any foreigner are also kept. But there is no such record of the talk between Oli and Goel.\\nThe Indian stance toward Oli suddenly changed after that midnight meeting. Oli unconstitutionally dissolved the House on December 20 without any reason just two months later. What if the conspiratorial attack on the House and Constitution Friday midnight was a result of that Oli-Goel meeting?\\nThe way the Indians are working in recent times to stop formation of an alternative government and dissolve the House gives credence to such suspicions. This has also led to another suspicion. What is the Indian roadmap? How can one believe that the election will be held in November?\\nThe country is reeling due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thousands are testing positive every day while the daily death toll has hovered over 150 on average for more than a week. No one can say when the pandemic will wane. Some experts fear that we may be swamped by the third wave even before the second wave recedes. It is difficult to believe that an election can be held amidst such raging pandemic. There are not even grounds to believe that Oli intends to hold election. The Constitution will be in doldrums if the election cannot be held.\\nIt's well-established that India does not like this Constitution or the House that amended the Constitution to incorporate the new map including the Nepali territories encroached by India. The strong CPN that it abhorred has been shattered due to division of CPN. Are these the objectives of India or is there more?\\nThe history of many countries testifies that democracy and Constitution and democracy of small neighboring countries do not have any meaning in comparison to the ego and interest of big countries. There have been precedents that even existence of some small countries have not mattered before the interest and ego of these big countries. \\xa0\\nTherefore, we must also be aware and vigilant about this external dimension while preparing to fight this arbitrary action of Oli. But there is no need to be frightened.\\nOur own history testifies that no despot or the external powers can do anything if all the citizens come together. This is the one lesson we should take from the Janaandolan II.\\nThe struggle against the Oli's blatant attack on democracy and Constitution will be long and difficult. But it is the people who will ultimately prevail. The people have emerged victorious in every movement in Nepal right from 1951. The relevance of certain individuals for external powers is transient and they are ruthlessly disowned when their relevance ends. The external powers cannot continuously back an individual pushing the people aside for long even if they were to wish so. \\xa0\\xa0\\nThe first battle in the struggle against Oli's attack against democracy and Constitution is the legal fight. The 149 lawmakers whose constitutional right to elect the new PM was denied should immediately move the court.\\nThis case is less complicated that the ones lodged after the first dissolution. The Supreme Court in its verdict while reinstating the House then has explained the process through which the Article 76(7) can be exercised to dissolve the House establishing the rights of the lawmakers to provide an alternative government through Article 76(5) of the Constitution. The majority lawmakers should go to the court demanding that very right President Bhandari has usurped.\\nThe battle to bring the Constitution and democracy on track should start from there. The rest should be gradually waged after that.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe deep political division in the recently formed Janata Samajwadi Party (JSP), which claims to represent the ethnic minorities across the hills and plains of Nepal, seems to have befuddled the political crystal gazers of Kathmandu.\\nThe Mahantha Thakur-Rajendra Mahato faction of the JSP threw its weight behind Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli in a recent vote of confidence in the parliament, neutralizing the possibility of forming an alternative government by opposition parties.\\nThakur, despite his penchant for nepotism, is a respected political figure and claims to represent the Madhesis who feel excluded by the exclusionary nature of Nepali nationalism based on hill ethos. Oli, on the other hand, is at another extreme of the political spectrum who is perceived to have thrived on the same nationalist rhetoric.\\nThe Thakur-Mahato faction has defended the move by claiming that the withdrawal of cases against those implicated in the Madhesh violence during the political transition is a proof that Oli has addressed the demands of the Madhesis “at least partially”, and that he cannot stab Oli on the back by joining an alternative government.\\nBut declining to take charge of some lucrative ministries in Kathmandu is something that hardly makes sense for ethnic parties that tend to be highly dependent on clientelistic politics for political survival. Now the question is: does the Thakur-Mahato faction have an alternative vision for its political survival?\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe second puzzle is the low profile of an otherwise hyperactive Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Hou Yanqi even as Nepal seems to have headed for an uncharted political territory – something that Beijing could have perceived as concerning for its security policy on the periphery in the changed geopolitical context. This is also in stark contrast to the previous wave of pandemic when she had raised hope of an adequate flow of Chinese medical aid to Nepal if required. The second wave of pandemic is now sweeping across the country, hospitals are running out of basic medical supplies, grieving families are mourning loved ones laid on funeral pyres, and social media walls are full of obituaries. Yet, ambassador Yanqi is no longer seen holding meetings with Nepali politicians in their residence in Kathmandu depriving the Nepali media of speculative stories about potential “Chinese plot to replace India in Nepal” that often send chills down the spine of Babus in New Delhi and invite knee-jerk responses from the Indian media to the delight of Twitterati in Kathmandu.\\nNor is Nepal clearly seeking help from China for medical supplies despite Oli’s presence on CNN to draw the US attention to the unfolding crisis in Nepal and his subsequent article in The Guardian appealing to the UK government for immediate help. China is perhaps in the best position to help Nepal at this moment, though both countries are our important partners and the US has, in particular, significantly helped Nepal. Yet, Oli made no such appeal to China which may have otherwise been obliged to respond to this crisis more effectively. Our prime minister’s open letter for help to a country that is seven seas apart, despite our historic ties, while ignoring the next-door neighbor must have baffled the Chinese who are increasingly embroiled in a major power rivalry and disputes over the initial handling of the pandemic. Equally baffling and shameful was a letter sent by Nepal to India a few weeks ago, seeking medical help such as oxygen supplies when India itself was reeling under acute oxygen shortage.\\nWhat do these two puzzles have in common, anyway? Putting these two pieces of puzzles together may provide a better picture of the big puzzle that is the Oli regime and may explain several other Oli moves that are puzzling even for those who have long been observing Nepali politics and society closely.\\nOli seems to have taken a new political turn from at least the time of Nepal visit by Samant Goel, chief of India’s intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) last year, as reported by several media outlets. Interestingly, Oli has maintained total silence on the disputed issues between Nepal and India since their meeting and the new so-called pointed map of Nepal has vanished from the official discourse. It appears that Oli’s rapport with the Indian PM Narendra Modi was facilitated by the network of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a militant wing of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leading to his transformation from a violent Leninist to a disciple of lord Shiva who defies the basic logic of science during pandemic. There are indications that he hopes to rule Nepal through a dominant party built along the image of BJP.\\nLeaders from the former Rashtriya Janata Party (RJP)—such as the Hindu high caste leaders of the JSP like Thakur, and other like Mahato—look eager to embrace Oli as coalition partners in the new game of Hindu politics. It is worth recalling that the RJP had shown a dubious commitment toward secularism before it merged with its former rival in the plains, Federal Socialist Party, Nepal. In fact, Madhesi parties are already in trouble and are looking for ways to make a comeback.\\nWithout full political support from JSP to an alternative government, Oli however seems confident that the country would head for fresh elections. Not surprisingly, another ardent supporter of fresh elections is Kamal Thapa who wants to revert Nepal to a Hindu kingdom. With these potential coalitional parties, Oli hopes to sweep elections in the Madhesh while maintaining his support in the hills that have long remained a bastion for communist politics.\\nThis should explain why the Indian sadhus furiously attacked Oli when he first declared that Ram was born in Thori of Nepal, but have remained silent over the dispute in recent times. The only plausible explanation is the ideological evolution of Oli from Marxist-Leninist stalwart to Hindu nationalist.\\nNot surprisingly, Oli seems to be in a hurry to inaugurate half-built concrete structures or the structures that will perhaps never be built. His government inaugurated 165 strategic roads without conducting environmental impact assessments and detailed project reports, and 306 hospitals that have been inaugurated but mostly forgotten since then. Much louder is his inauguration of yet-to-be-completed Dharahara that lit up the night sky amidst a deadly pandemic. After all, Hindutva and development are two pillars of Modi politics that Oli seeks to emulate in Nepal. And, after his rapport with India, Oli is following India’s China policy in Nepal, too – that is keeping China out if its security perimeter, the Himalayas.\\nThe RSS imagines Nepal a part of the Akhanda Bharat (indivisible India) and have traditionally drawn inspiration for politics of Hindu state in India from Nepal. The Modi regime feels more vulnerable to the growing influence of the post-pandemic China in its periphery. But, as the second wave has totally paralyzed India, Oli could be a useful person to minimize the potentially growing Chinese influence in Nepal.\\nWith the help from India, KP Oli also seems to have snatched away the agenda of Hindu politics from former king Gyanendra and is using to shore up support for himself. But political strategies, however sound they may look, often fail. After all, the Hindu king himself was dethroned in Nepal, though one may argue that the context has significantly changed now. In contrast to what happened in India, Nepalis do not have any enduring collective memory of foreign invasion or occupation. Nor do we have the trauma of massive religious violence or partition of the country. But, religious violence could be a convenient way to mobilize the majority especially in the run up to elections, as evidence from India shows. Hindutva politics may fail in Nepal and may even prove to be a joke, but that doesn’t mean that it will not push the country toward religious violence and authoritarianism. But the immediate concern is that the geopolitical game seems to have paralyzed us from taking help from all other countries including China.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe Maoist insurgency for many women was one of the most horrifying nightmares and continues to be the one. They had to face gross human rights violation such as sexual violence and rape. Conflict Report, 2012 states that more than one third of these victims were below 15 at the time of crime. Such bitter experiences of women continues to affect different aspects of their lives today.\\nFor some women, the incidents of them being sexually abused and raped were known to others too because they were raped in front of their children, husband, and other members of family or friends. Some of these women now face further violence and denial from their families and social stigma from their communities. For some, their husbands have asked them to leave saying they no longer are suitable to be their wife. Such discriminatory behaviors from family and community scare many other women to talk about sexual violence committed during the conflict. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2016 recorded 316 complaints related to sexual assaults, the least number of complaints among all categories. However, many reports such as Conflict Report, 2012 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Thematic Report by TRIAL International, 2020 claim the number to be much higher because such cases remain much under-reported.\\nTribunal Report, 2018 by WOREC states that in lack of state mechanism, the female survivors of conflict continue to live with trauma. The case studies collected by WOREC and reviewed for writing this article show that being sexually abused during the conflict has resulted in deterioration of the mental and reproductive health conditions for women. At present, they experience severe mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, insomnia, loss of appetite, and pessimism about living itself, leading to suicidal thoughts. On the part of their reproductive health, many of them have developed reproductive health issues such as multiple miscarriages, uterine prolapse, infection, wounds in the uterus and uterine cancer. Nepal lacks proper mental and reproductive health services at the local level, making treatment inaccessible even in such life-threatening health situations.\\nThe faulty policy provisions and inadequate livelihood-related programs, lack of accessible health services, and patriarchal social norms have mainly created hindrances on these women's way to transitional justice in Nepal. We neither have adequate laws nor are those justice providing mechanisms serious. The TRC Act 2014 provides the possibility of amnesty even in the cases of grave human rights violations, including sexual abuse and rape. Due to fear of social stigma and the possibility of familial disowning, many women have not yet spoken up about being sexually abused during the war, which means significantly fewer cases of such incidents is included in national data. Because of this, the survivors of sexual violence couldn't access any of the state's relief support though conflict affected them severely. Similarly, we do not have mental health and adequate reproductive health services at the local level.\\nTo resolve the issues of survivors of sexual violence committed during the conflict, the government should focus on developing a unique mechanism in registering and investigating cases. There should be a justice mechanism that guarantees the privacy and protection of those who file the complaint. Survivors of sexual violence cannot present proofs, nor can they identify their perpetrators in most cases. Therefore, their statement should suffice to register the case and start an investigation, and the process should be handled by trained service providers, including female staffers. The provision of amnesty should be removed from the TRC Act. It is also the state's responsibility to design economic support programs and vocational training to support their livelihood. A well-resourced health institution at each ward and the facility of a counselor for mental well-being are required. The cases that the Truth and Reconciliation Commission have registered should be taken immediately into a fair and unbiased investigation for providing justice to the survivors and punishment to the perpetrators. Further violence and stigma against survivors of sexual violence are due to deep-rooted patriarchal mindsets and unequal social norms. Therefore, community awareness programs have to be integrated with all other initiatives for reintegration of the survivors.\\n(The author is program coordinator at WOREC)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nDuring the first two months of this year, I worked as one of many doctors vaccinating people in the UK thus helping deliver COVID-19 protection to the elderly and the vulnerable. I returned to Nepal this month and wondered how reactions to the vaccine differed in the two countries. People in both often express concerns about the safety of a vaccine which has been produced so quickly. Usually vaccines take years to develop and yet a vaccine for COVID-19 was launched within a year of the identification of the COVID-19 virus: surely safety was compromised! Is this the case and how vaccines have been made so speedily?\\nGenerally, any new vaccine or medicine during development goes through a sequential series of trials for efficacy and safety. If at any stage it is found to be ineffective or dangerous, development ceases and no more money is spent on it. In the case of COVID-19 vaccines, pharmaceutical companies ran many of these trials parallelly. The correct normal procedures were still followed without cutting corners and compromising safety. The reasons that pharmaceutical companies don’t usually do things this way is because of financial risk. In the case of COVID-19, various national governments financially supported a range of pharmaceutical companies allowing them to produce the vaccines speedily but safely and thus mitigate this financial risk. Numerous different vaccines were in development in many countries at the same time, and inevitably not all were successful. The vaccine that was being researched in France by Pasteur Institute, for example, proved ineffective and production ceased. Pasteur could not recoup any of its costs through vaccine sales, but the company was cushioned by government support.\\nThere has been a lot of discussion about which vaccine is ‘best’; efficacies have been quoted as highest for the Russian Sputnik vaccine and also the Pfizer and Moderna products at over 90%. The AstraZeneca or ‘Oxford’ vaccine, which is the type that is being rolled out in Nepal, appears to have slightly lower efficacy. This has led to claims that this vaccine is being dumped in the third world. However, this is the vaccine that is being given to most people (>70%) in Britain and it seems to have an excellent safety profile.\\nIt is important to remember that few vaccines give 100% protection against any specific disease. Even those that do so in theory, may fail if the cold chain is broken or there are other problems in delivery. Many vaccines have relatively low efficacies. For example, influenza vaccine is 40 – 60% effective, BCG probably around only 50% efficacious while typhoid is about 65% with zero protection against paratyphoid. It is difficult to say what the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine is as it is so new:\\xa0 it is at least 70% with one study suggesting it was 81% after a single dose. While studies in Scotland showed that administration of just one AstraZeneca dose reduced hospital admissions by 94% compared to a reduction of ‘up to 85%’ for Pfizer. The immune response to the vaccine depends on which strain of the virus is circulating, whether an absolute protection is quoted against even mild disease as well as serious and deadly cases, the amount of vaccine given, the dosing interval and probably also the age of the person being vaccinated.\\nPfizer and Moderna vaccines are reported to have good efficacies (above 90%) but need to be kept frozen at very low temperatures (-70°C and -20°C respectively) making the risk of vaccine spoilage real, especially in a region where there are frequent power cuts and poor transportation facilities. The AstraZeneca vaccine is more robust and just needs to be kept in an ordinary fridge.\\nChina’s Sinovac is being rolled out in Brazil, Turkey, Indonesia, Singapore and other countries and, while its efficacy is reported to be the least good of all the vaccines, it is still above the 50% required for regulatory approval. Although it does seem to have a relatively low efficacy against preventing all symptoms, importantly it appears to be powerful in preventing severe disease and death. Despite having an efficacy that may be lower than other vaccines, this will still help protect us all when large numbers of people are vaccinated. It is sad that there is so much discussion about which vaccine is ‘best’ and that this has become a political issue or a matter of national pride. French President Emmanuel Macron was inappropriately critical of the successful British AstraZeneca vaccine perhaps partly in reaction to the failure of the French vaccine. It is important that as many of us get vaccinated as possible. Politics should steer clear of this, except perhaps to curb profits. Pfizer are reportedly making 80% on each ampule of vaccine it sells while AstraZeneca is distributing at cost. Let’s accept whatever vaccine is being offered and listen to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Gebreyesus who repeatedly says that “none of us is safe until we are all safe.” By this he means it is a global priority for as many people to get jabbed as is possible, and let us not worry about theoretical efficacy comparisons.\\nSafety, of course, is a different matter. The very high death rates in the UK has stimulated a good response from the government and more than a third of the British adult population has been vaccinated to date. That’s more than 22 million people. In Nepal, some elderly people and those with medical conditions worry that the vaccine may harm them since perhaps they think that their bodies are weak but the UK program started with such elderly people (including the 94-year-old Queen and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip) and people with multiple medical conditions because they are at greatest risk of dying from COVID-19. The people of Nepal can be reassured that UK citizens have done an excellent and reassuring safety trial!\\nAs a routine, vaccinators (both in Nepal and the UK) ask people about allergies and other medical details although there are a very few reasons not to have the vaccine. There is no problem for people with multiple medical conditions including diabetes, high blood pressure, cardiac or kidney ailments taking the vaccine. It is probably best avoided in pregnancy and anyone with multiple severe allergies (particularly those causing collapse and needing hospital admission) should probably take the vaccine at a health post or hospital.\\nIn the UK, patients went straight home after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine but were asked not to drive or cycle for 15 minutes. Short-term side-effects after the vaccine are to be expected and are reported in more than one in 10 people. Side-effects seem to be more common in younger rather than older people (over the age of 65) and in women more than men. Most people have a slight local pain at the site of the injection. People who take blood-thinners might expect a little bruising at the site of the injection, although the needle is very fine. (I take blood thinners but did not experience this problem) Some people experience body aches and fever but only for a day or so and paracetamol helps those who are feeling uneasy. A few feel quite unwell for nearly a week after receiving the vaccine, but this is a small cost for protection against a potentially fatal disease.\\nLet us all keep each other safe by accepting the vaccine when it is offered and continuing mask-wearing and maintaining social distancing until we are all vaccinated. The governments have briefed the people but increased dissemination of accessible information by it and major stakeholders would reassure the public and improve trust.\\n(The author is a British physician who has lived in Nepal for about nine years over the last 25 years or so.

       "  '\\nIn many countries around the world, volunteerism is leveraged to help achieve societal changes and, as a complementary tool to public policies implemented by the government, it plays an important role in alleviating pressing problems faced by the people.\\nYou can find volunteers in action in every sector from conservation efforts to humanitarian support for those who are in most need.\\nNepal boasts a vibrant civil society, and solidarity and altruism have been unique features of the country well before even the term “volunteerism” was introduced here.\\nWe have seen how during the pandemic, volunteers in Nepal like in many other parts of \\xa0the world got activated in multiple ways, from the production of personal protective equipment (PPE) to feeding those groups within the society who have been most affected by the lockdowns.\\nNow the country has a unique opportunity to bring volunteerism to the next level thanks to the formulation of a draft National Volunteering Policy that, once finalized and approved by the federal government, could herald a new era for the sector.\\nPrepared by the Policy Research Institute or PRI, a government-led public think tank, the draft policy is a key document that envisions the enabling conditions for volunteerism to better contribute to the national development process.\\nWith the ongoing economic crisis stemming from the pandemic forcing governments and civil society alike to re-think their traditional socio-economic models, there is no doubt that volunteerism can play a big role.\\nGlobally there has been an effort, led by the United Nations Volunteers (UNV) to broaden up and modernize the traditional boundaries and categories of volunteering action, acknowledging, very importantly, the existence of a so-called “continuum” that goes from more informal traditional forms of altruism that are so strong in many rural areas of Nepal to more organized forms of volunteering.\\nThe draft policy being worked out by PRI under the leadership of Dr Bishnu Upreti, is wide-ranging and encompassing this multifaceted nature of volunteerism in the country.\\nWith an ambitious vision of “developing volunteering program in the form of effective medium for the social, cultural and economic transformation of the country”, the draft also calls for further legislation that can codify and strengthen volunteerism in the country in future.\\nThe Philippines, for example, is one country in the Asia Pacific Region that has a solid volunteering infrastructure with a legislation and an appropriate supporting system provided by the government.\\nIt is exactly what the draft is calling for because without involvement of the federal, provincial and local governments--whose role is well recognized in the document--it will be impossible for Nepal to fully expand volunteering opportunities for all.\\nThis is why the fact the draft envisions a National Volunteering Promotion Center is so paramount.\\nThis is the institution that ultimately would play an indispensable role in enabling citizens from all walks of life to embrace volunteerism ensuring positive social outcomes.\\nWe need to ensure that such institution is going to have the necessary resources and institutional autonomy to become the key national actor in promoting and facilitating volunteerism.\\nInterestingly the draft policy will enable volunteerism as a springboard to equip youths and older working-age citizens alike to find and create employment opportunities.\\nWith Nepal aiming to graduate from the least developing status, it is indispensable to have innovative tools to promote new skills that will be meaningful in the job market and volunteerism is definitely one of them.\\nThe drafters were also innovative in recognizing the role that non-resident Nepalis could have in promoting volunteerism because the national diaspora, if properly cultivated, could have a big role in helping develop the country by engaging in well-formulated and planned volunteering activities.\\nThe facilities envisioned by the draft are in this sense progressive also because they try to bring clarity and legitimacy to properly managed and, most importantly, effective volunteering efforts by foreigners, an issue that has always been sensitive.\\nEnsuring a strong National Volunteering Promotion Center that perhaps could be renamed in a way that would give it a stronger mandate, beyond just promotion, is vital.\\nFor example it could be named National Volunteering Council, an institution that the draft for now describes the highest level decision making committee in matter of volunteerism as.\\nChaired by federal Minister for Youth and Sports with participation of Social Development Ministers of seven provinces and the secretaries and other top policy makers, such council, the draft states, will coordinate with another body, the Volunteering Program Implementation Committee that will itself supervise the National Volunteering Promotion Center.\\nAt the end of the day, no matter the names to be given to the different institutions in charge of volunteerism, what counts is to have a well-resourced but also at the same time lean and agile implementing body that, while fully accountable to the policy makers, will be capable not only to supervise and monitor but also enable strong and effective volunteering activities.\\nThe stronger such body is, the more chances the sector will have to prosper and thrive with better social outcomes on the ground.\\nThe fact that the draft also calls for such body to coordinate a web portal managing the supply and demand of volunteers bodes well for the sector.\\nThis is important because volunteering, as well-stated by the draft policy, can have positive effects also on the education sector, equipping students with new learning and serving experiences that will enrich their learning process.\\nHaving local units or volunteering centers under the supervision of local governments could be another fundamental element to truly enable an effective system that facilitates citizens, including the most vulnerable ones, to contribute to national development, helping Nepal achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\\nLast but not the least the process that led to formulation of the draft has been even more interesting because it was based on a real collaboration that saw an innovative public research institution partnering with civil society organizations, all passionately involved in promoting volunteerism, with the UNV as a key facilitator and enabler.\\nThe fact that such partnerships have been enabled could itself be the best practice.\\nNow it is up to the citizens of Nepal, not only activists and practitioners, to get engaged and ensure that draft can be improved.\\nDiscussions, on the ground in all the seven provinces and also virtually, are being held to ensure that the draft document can get the attention that is due and also the much-needed feedbacks and suggestions.\\nThe country has a unique opportunity to achieve the Agenda 2030 by leveraging volunteerism. Best of luck Nepal!\\n(This Sunday, 28th of Feb at 3pm and on Monday, 1st of March, an on-line event will take place to learn about and discuss the policy.

       "  \"\\nI was 12 or 13 years old when I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to join a remembrance tour to some concentration camps across Austria and Germany.\\nIt was an experience as shocking as transformational for me and I do still vividly remember walking around the Dachau camp, one of the biggest and most deadly among all the extermination sites across Europe.\\nThe fact that the Embassy of Israel, the Embassy of Germany, the Delegation of the European Union to Nepal and the United Nations in Nepal joined hands to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust is significant also for Nepal.\\nBecause, though very far from here, the deliberate attempt at suppressing and exterminating one entire civilization and culture during the World War II, should remind us at the same time how vicious human beings can turn out to be but also the spirit of forgivingness that can help us heal and become better persons.\\nIndeed, the Holocaust is a universal story, the biggest tragedy faced by our humanity and at the same time, it is a great example how victims and perpetrators can come together in a spirit of peace and reconciliation.\\nIt is a story not just about what Jews had to endure not only during the World War II but also in the years before that, crucial years in which anti-Semitism grew exponentially, day by day, throughout Europe, fueled by harsh rhetoric that at the end normalized hatred and led to millions being killed.\\nUnfortunately the seeds of what happened then might, tragically, lead us to more tragedies now fueled by a hatred toward others that are just different from us.\\nInstead of getting rid of racism and discriminations, the era we are living through is more and more bogged down by misconceptions, stereotypes, charged emotions against particular minorities, a phenomenon echoed by a pervasive social media that have been working as echo chambers to disseminate disinformation and falsehoods.\\nRemembering the Holocaust in Nepal is important because at its roots there is a fundamental racist view of the world that comes from ignorance, fear and insecurity.\\nUnfortunately there is no country around the world that is immune from these and while it is true that a genocide is something monstrously different from any other type of crimes that happened so far in the modern history, there are links and common points between all types of violence based on discriminatory attitudes.\\nThough it can take different forms and shapes, at the core of the enabling factors that led to extermination of millions of Jewish people is a view of the society that somehow some are better than others, that some are deemed to be the culprits of existing problems even though the underlying rationale of such accusations are totally baseless.\\nWe should be extremely careful to draw comparisons of what happened in Europe between the World War I and events in other parts of the world.\\nEncouragingly now there is an international legal framework--there is a convention against racism, there is the international convention upholding human rights universally and there is much more awareness about what can lead to a genocide.\\nAnd yet we are witnessing how racism including anti-Semitism is spreading in Europe and in North America, where even a recent football game in Milan had one of the most successful football player mocking with a racist remark his opponent, also a remarkable and extremely talented athlete but with a different skin color.\\nOne thing can lead to another and we should be really careful to condone small remarks, even those that are being made unconsciously.\\nIt is from these subtle discriminations that stronger and more vocal forms of racism originate, kicking off a sort of snowball effect that can truly lead to more serious forms of crimes, including violence.\\nEducation against racism, against the pre-concepts that are inborn in each of us, education for a better understanding is indispensable.\\nThat’s why the fact that the Higher Institutions and Secondary Schools' Association Nepal (HISSAN) has joined the official commemorations on what is officially called the International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust also known internationally as International Holocaust Remembrance Day is important.\\nCivic education plays a key role in shaping students’ view of their country and the world.\\nPatriotism is definitely an important element of civic education but discussions about it should not set aside talks about other aspects that can make a country not only great and prosperous but just.\\nAs an European I am encouraged by the actions being taken by the European Commission to fight anti-Semitism and other forms of racism but as someone deeply in love with Nepal, I also would like to see schools and colleges around the country to better embed their civic education classes with elements of social justice, human rights, all elements that are the foundations of what this country is aspiring to become.\\nIn this there is no country that can really teach others on how to model the perfectly equitable and just society.\\nIt is going to be “a work in construction” everywhere and we can all learn from each other.\\nMy dear friend Michael Rosenkrantz who for several years has been living in Nepal and who had many family members killed during the Holocaust, shares to me:\\n“There is still anti-Semitism in existence because people are very tribal. It’s not just about anti-Semitism but is just a general dislike of others who don’t look like us”.\\nWe often relate to each other more for our differences than for what we have in common. We can see how this is pervasive in the United States and in Europe as well.\\nPerhaps as human beings we are wired for this but I believe we can always be better and the way Germany has embraced its moral failures during the World War II is exemplary.\\nNo genocides have been committed in Nepal but discrimination in many forms is still rampant.\\nNepal has a real opportunity to instill positive and universal values among its youths to lay the foundation for a better nation.\\nHaving one week of awareness about the Holocaust as it has been planned by the organizers of the Holocaust’s commemoration this year is going to be important but how can we attach more meaning to the concept of active citizenship, one that does a better job at internalizing the principles enshrined in the Constitution of this country with its quest for peace, harmony and justice?\\nWhile it is true that Nepal has been progressing on its human rights agenda, the recent universal review of its human rights performance also shows that there are still many gaps, not only at the policy level.\\nMy visit to Dachau shaped me in so many ways.\\nTalking about the tragedies of our past generations, even if they occurred far away and decades ago, can help us become better and truly push for a more equitable, just Nepal, a country that can become a paragon for upholding human rights.\\n(Galimberti is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE, an NGO partnering with youths to promote social inclusion in Nepal.

       "  \"\\nPrime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli has once again been isolated after bringing the controversial ordinance about Constitutional Council.\\nPM Oli on April 20 had also issued an ordinance allowing appointments at constitutional bodies through majority of the Constitutional Council. He had also brought another ordinance allowing splitting of political parties with support of 40 percent in the central committee or parliamentary party.\\nHe had stepped back after widespread opposition from within the ruling party and outside, and decided to withdraw the two ordinances four days later.\\nPM Oli has again issued the ordinance about the Constitutional Council with the same provisions eight months on. President Bidya Devi Bhandari has again hastily authenticated the ordinance that was not even discussed in the Cabinet like then.\\nThe Constitutional Council Act requires presence of four members apart from the PM who chairs the council for quorum. Oli has issued the ordinance with a provision that allows decision with support of the majority of the existing members. This means three members can now hold the meeting and take decision. In other words, it has paved the way for PM Oli to take decision in presence of the chief justice (CJ) and the National Assembly chairman.\\nThe Constitution envisions presence of all three organs of the state and the main opposition party in the Constitutional Council to ensure that the government does not make unilateral appointments in constitutional bodies. The Constitutional Council chaired by the PM therefore includes chief justice (CJ), House speaker and deputy speaker, National Assembly chairman and the main opposition leader.\\nPM Oli by bringing the ordinance has effectively ousted the main opposition leader and House speaker from the Constitutional Council rendering them redundant in appointments in constitutional bodies. This is a coup d'état by the PM on Constitutional Council against the spirit of Constitution.\\nThis arbitrary step has once again isolated the PM in Nepali politics. The ordinance has been roundly criticized inside Oli's party and outside.\\nThe main opposition Nepali Congress (NC) has made its stance against the ordinance clear. The main opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba has not attended the Constitutional Council meeting convened Tuesday evening after the ordinance was brought. He has revealed that he had warned that NC will not support if Oli were to bring an ordinance.\\nPM Oli did not consult inside ruling CPN before bringing the ordinance. Ministers have said the issue was not discussed even in the Cabinet meeting held before it was issued.\\nThe other Chairman of CPN Pushpa Kamal Dahal has already demanded immediate revocation of the ordinance stating that it has been brought without consulting the party. Other CPN leaders have also publicly slammed the ordinance. Janardan Sharma, who is close to Dahal, has called the ordinance height of the self-interest of government. NC Vice-president Bimalendra Nidhi has called issue of the ordinance totalitarian and autocratic step. He has commented that this has blatantly attacked the Constitution and system.\\nOli, who has been cornered inside ruling CPN, does not seem to be in the mood to step back this time despite widespread condemnation of the ordinance. He seems to have taken the confrontational step after Speaker Agni Sapkota took the decision to not attend Constitutional Council meeting after consulting with Dahal and Senior Leader Madhav Kumar Nepal.\\nDeputy PM and secretariat member Ishwar Pokharel, who is close to Oli, has commented that the ordinance has been brought as the Constitutional Council has been stuck without capacity to do any work. But this step by PM Oli does not look right either on the crucible of practicality or the spirit of Constitution.\\nOli, who is in acute minority inside the ruling party, seems determined to make appointments in constitutional bodies by staging the coup on Constitutional Council. He seems to see political benefits for him even if the party were to split.\\nBut he has grossly under-estimated the harm this step can do for him. This step will further boost the anti-Oli environment inside CPN. By taking an arbitrary step of this extent for his personal interest, PM Oli has justified the efforts inside the party to oust him.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe issue of freedom of expression frequently comes up for discussion in Nepal. Rapper Samir Ghising (Vten)’s newly released song titled “Paara” has once again dragged freedom of expression into the discussion. On October 29, 2020, Nepal Police Headquarters had directed the Cyber Bureau to take legal action against Vten stating that his song \"Paara\" contains indecent language which is contrary to public decency. While the Cyber Bureau was searching for Vten, he approached the Patan\\xa0High Court against the order of the Police Headquarters. The Court on November 3, 2020 granted interim relief to Vten ordering the authorities not to arrest him. However, it is not the first time that rappers and singers have been arrested for allegedly spreading indecency in society. Vten was apprehended around the same time last year for using ‘anti-social’ words in one of his songs. The Nepal Police had also arrested singer Durgesh Thapa around the same time last year after he was dragged into controversy due to the words used in his song titled \\'Happy Tihar, Chiso Beer’.\\nPublic opinion always gets divided as to whether these forms of arrest or action against the artists or citizens in the name of spreading indecency in society are appropriate or not. In the issue of the recent incident of Vten, some people say that his song “Paara” contains certain words that a decent person would hesitate to use even in a private place because those are not regarded socially acceptable and are likely to encourage disharmony and indecency in society, arguing that the action, therefore, is appropriate. Whereas others believe that everyone has the right to exercise the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of opinion and expression and that everyone has the right to choose whether to listen or not. They insist no one should, therefore, be penalized for exercising their right of opinion and expression.\\nIn regard to the question of freedom of expression in the context of Nepal, the words of Justice Sapana Pradhan Malla are worth remembering: “The freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution and law is not absolute freedom. The obligation thereof is annexed with that. Such rights should be exercised in such a manner that such exercise would not harm any person or community and that it would not hurt the self-respect of anyone. In a diverse society like ours with multiple castes, multiple languages, and multiple religions, special consideration should be given while exercising the freedom of expression.”\\nThe freedom of opinion and expression is subject to certain limitations--one of the limitations is that it should not be contrary to public decency and morality. The Constitution of Nepal discourages the expressions of indecent matters in public by explicitly stating that the freedom of opinion and expression which becomes contrary to public decency or morality can be restrained by making appropriate laws. Our society is a pluralistic society--yet people live in harmony and unity because one group respects the norms, values, beliefs, etc. of another, one person respects another person. If someone uses slanderous and libelous words against another person even in private, such acts are against law and are punishable under the laws of Nepal.\\nWhenever the discussion on freedom of expression arises, some people seem to be defending the alleged act by referring to the government and law enforcement agency’s inaction toward control of other crimes like corruption, rape, etc. Such defense may be practical in some circumstance as they outline the weakness of the law enforcement agencies, but does not seem logical. It is like saying that someone is free to beat people or steal money because another person has escaped punishment on the allegation of murder. The paucity of effective measures of law enforcement agencies to control one nature of crime cannot be an excuse for escaping punishment for another crime. If people begin to develop such a belief, it may lead the society toward impunity for grave crimes. The question is whether we desire the rule of law or impunity to exist. The beauty of democracy is, of course, the rule of law. If certain acts of a citizen qualify the criteria of an offense, it should be punishable as per the law.\\nAs a common instance in the matter of freedom of expression, we can take reference of how our laws regulate the screening of movies or broadcasting media. Under the laws of Nepal, any movie to be released undergoes a censor screening prior to release because it is going to the masses and has the capacity to influence them. If any movie or any part thereof is found to be jeopardizing law and order or harmonious relation among people or causing negative impact to the public interest, decent behavior or morality or defame any person or encouraging the violence against women or incitement to commit any offense, such movie would not be permitted for screening as per the Motion Picture (Production, Exhibition, and Distribution) Act. Similar consideration goes with the broadcast media. It seems that the intent behind the censorship is to protect the ultimate interest of the people at large. Some years back there were no YouTube, or Facebook/Twitter, or other social media platforms. There were only radio, television, and movies that were required to follow certain protocols including the requirement of filtering of offensive or indecent contents if any. At present time, YouTube and other social media platforms are preferred over the radio, television, or movies. The YouTube videos or any other social media outlets put disclaimer at the beginning of the content. The mere presence of the disclaimer, however, does not limit its reach and influence toward the younger people or children. This gives a clear understanding that social media like YouTube also requires effective regulation in order to minimize the negative impacts in the society as well as to avoid such arbitrary arrests of artistes or citizens in the name of spreading indecent contents over social media.\\nEveryone is entitled to exercise freedom of expression. At the same time, one should also be able to measure the possible impact toward the public at large, more particularly the impact toward the children. The exercise of rights should go along with the obligations to abide by the Constitution and the laws. What is normal for one section may not always be acceptable to another section of the same society. The common point, therefore, should be encouraging the commonly accepted matters or reaching a commonly agreed point, if possible. If reaching a commonly agreed point is not possible, avoiding the controversial and divisive matters would remain an option. To end this controversy or have an agreeable solution to this discussion, there is a need for laws to regulate these matters. The balance between the rights and obligations would only take society toward the direction as required by the laws of the land. As the citizens are the ultimate reformers of society, we should always be mindful of our rights as well as obligations.\\n(The author is a law student)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nWhen the COVID-19 pandemic hit, thousands of Nepali migrant workers working in India returned home to be with their families during the challenging time. After exhausting their savings and sensing limited to no employment opportunities in their home country, they have now begun returning to India, with better hopes for jobs there. On a completely different note, India recently banned onion export owing to its domestic shortage. This ban resulted in a massive price hike in the Nepali market. Given the Nepali people's preference for Indian onions over the Chinese onions, the price will continue to rise until India relaxes the export. These two isolated examples paint only a small picture of Nepal's (inter)dependence on the Indian economy, which often gets noticeable attention in the debates concerning Nepal-India relations. What often remains under-stressed is the people-to-people relations between the two countries. While negotiating the 'special' relationship between the two countries, leaders often forget that the Nepal-India bond is more than a relationship between Delhi and Kathmandu. Its fate cannot be decided merely by political elites.\\nEarlier this year, Vice-chairman of ruling CPN Bam Dev Gautam expressed his desire to build a five-meter tall wall along the Nepal-India border. Given the issue's sensitivity due to the recurring border disputes, strict restrictions along the border may appear to many as a logical response. However, the romanticism of such harsh measures ignores the ground reality of thousands of Nepalis living along the border, whose livelihoods depend not just on Nepal's amicable relationship with India but also on the open Nepal-India border. The flow of people and goods between the two countries is so vital for the survival and everyday lives of the people living in the border regions that no border control measure ever completely shuts the nuanced dynamics of the border. This has been evident during the coronavirus-related national lockdowns of the two countries. Although the border remains 'closed' officially, people who live near lesser-known and informal border points continue to visit their families and shop from the towns across the border. Such cross-border activities are unavoidable necessities of the people, which even the deadly pandemic has not been able to tame. National debates on the Nepal-India relationship and border control fail to consider such complexities and nuances of the cross-border dynamics.\\nA vital component of the nuanced Nepal-India border dynamics is the region's sociocultural composition and history. Despite the\\xa0redrawing of the political boundary between the two countries after the 1816 Sugauli Treaty, the sociocultural boundary comprising of southern Nepal and northern India continues to exist. The people of this region have so much in common—from the religious practices and festivals to languages, costumes, lifestyle, and even the caste system—that cross-border marriage is still prevalent, particularly in the Madhesi community residing in the southern plains of Nepal. Such marital relations mean families and relatives on both sides of the border. In fact, the practice is so common that almost every Madhesi family has at least one family member or a relative across the border. Depriving thousands of people of their access to their families in the name of national security and border control would be an assault on their rights and an insult to their sociocultural identity, practice, and heritage. Madhesi people wishing for Nepal's cordial relationship with India and less restrictive border mechanisms is no surprise or coincidence.\\nAnother important factor that national debates on border control usually overlook is the informal economic activities along the Nepal-India border. While the open border allows people of the two countries to freely move and work without having to worry about visa and work permits, it has special significance for the Nepalis living along the border. Informal trade of goods between Nepal and India, mainly through smaller border points, is no secret. Several factors such as availability, price, brand, accessibility, and proximity lure Nepali customers to the nearest town across the border to import goods as essential as food and fertilizer. Similarly, Nepali farmers often take their goods to the nearest Indian town for better price or simply because that is their most convenient option. Therefore, the open Nepal-India border has established complex economic activities; aiming to shut the border completely would hamper the people in unprecedented ways. A good example is the strict regulation against the import of fertilizers, which has created chaos among Nepali farmers. Although establishing necessary border mechanisms to control the illegal flow of goods is essential, making decisions that directly impact thousands of people's lives by ignoring the true extent of their dependence on such economic activities will prove counterproductive.\\nThe Nepal-India open border has its challenges. Apart from the occasional border disputes, either between the two governments or between the communities, the open border invites a set of security threats to Nepal, such as illegal immigration, smuggling, human/girl trafficking, terrorism, and other criminal activities. However, Nepal should not view these threats as a welcome indicator to completely shut the border and, in the process, hurt its own citizens and harm the long-existing 'special' relationship with India. Instead, it should sit down for dialogue and propose joint measures to tackle the challenges because these security threats affect both the countries. Nepal's increasing strategic importance in the region provides it with the necessary leverage for significant positive changes.\\nBorder disputes are neither new nor surprising phenomenon. It occurs almost everywhere in the world, where two or more countries share boundaries. As a landlocked country sandwiched between India and China, Nepal is prone to this problem too. Due to Nepal's political history with India, a long border with India, and a higher population density along the Nepal-India border, Nepal's disputes with India are more frequent and visible than those with China. But there\\xa0 Chinese construction in Nepali territory in Humla. However, such disputes should not direct the course of a country's relationship with its neighbor. As a small country, Nepal's sensitivity regarding its territorial integrity, sovereignty, and national security is well justified. However, what is unwise is Nepal's preferential treatment of its one neighbor and a deliberate distancing of the other, especially when it has severe consequences for its people. As discussed above, the Nepal-India relationship is more than a mere diplomatic association between the two countries. Before making any decision that further tarnishes the people-to-people relationship between the two countries, therefore, the political elites should consider their implications for the people.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nMedical students and young doctors are Dr Govinda KC’s most ardent supporters. But as Dr KC is on his 19th fast-unto-death with his usual demands for medical education reforms, young doctors and medical students are protesting against the Medical Education Commission (MEC), the apex medical education regulatory body in the country, which Dr KC compelled the government to form. The commission’s first Common Entrance Exam (CEE) scheduled for October 13 is now the biggest source of despair for the majority of doctors in the country as it cruelly discriminates between government and non-government doctors.   The National Medical Education Regulation published on August 10 reserved 40% of all post graduate (PG) seats for doctors working in government institutions including those working in contract. Another 10% is allocated to foreigners leaving only 50% of the post graduate seats in open category. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health refused to issue no objection certificates (NOC) to doctors working in government institutions in contract to ensure that all 40% of seats is reserved for permanent government doctors. The Ministry is now threatening to withhold funds for post graduate education in public institutes if these reservations are given to anyone except their employees.\\xa0   There are currently 150 odd eligible permanent doctors who can appear in the CEE this year compared to nearly 10,000 non-government doctors. The 40% represents 450 PG seats which means there will be three seats for each permanent government doctor (The unfilled seats reserved for government doctors will be passed on to open category). This regulation and cunningness of the Ministry of Health at behest of Government Doctors Association of Nepal (GODAN) has effectively reserved 40% of all post graduate seats to 1% doctors. This distribution is unfair, unjust, restricts meritocracy and will erode quality medical education in the country.  Policy Corruption  The regulation was originally slated to reserve only 20% of PG seats to government doctors, which would still yield one and half seat to each permanent doctor. However, with undue influence from GODAN, the bureaucrats at the Ministry of Health, who were involved in revising the regulation upped the reservation to 50%. GODAN is the official organization of doctors working under the Ministry of Health. Hence, this provision was effectively revised by the Ministry of Health officials to benefit other employees at the ministry. Some of us protested after their deceitful plan of 50% reservation was leaked to public. It was lowered to 40% and included the doctors working in contract in the reservation category after that. Dr KC on the 10th day of his current fast added increasing open seats to 70% to his list of demands.  Government doctors are some of the better paid doctors in the country with plenty of financial incentives and opportunities for growth. They are better compensated for the work they do compared to others. There is absolutely no justification for reserving nearly half of all seats in public institutions for government employees.   People get offended when public roads are blocked for a few minutes for VIPs. Imagine half of all the roads being reserved for vehicles of government employees all the time. This is exactly what the regulation has done to post graduate medical education. This is one of the worst forms of policy corruption in the country done merely to benefit a few government employees at the cost of damaging the entire health care system in the country.   Other issues   The notice issued by the MEC regarding the exam is mired with confusion. A doctor competing in the exam in the open category can earn up to 10 points prior to the exam if he has served in rural areas. This provision will definitely encourage young doctors to work in rural areas. However, the regulation published a month back hasn’t given doctors any time to earn these points. Hence, it is only fair to apply this scoring system a few years later.   The MEC has also kept the seat distribution of MD/MS seats a secret. The regulation dictates that 50% of seats be allocated to open category but it doesn’t state how this distribution should be done. Foul play is further suspected due to the refusal of MEC to reveal the seat distribution. The matching system introduced by MEC replacing the existing open house counseling is also receiving stark criticism for being prone to manipulation and helping unfair competition. The open house counseling, wherein the top-ranked got to select a program first followed by the second-ranked and so on, guaranteed merit-based selection of programs. MEC’s matching system will provide successful candidates the opportunity to select and prioritize 25 MD/MS programs of their choice. With over 100 different MD/MS programs running across the country the matching system cannot guarantee merit-based selection unless candidates are allowed to select and prioritize every single program.\\nConsequences   The MEC has been the biggest source of frustration for doctors ever since its formation. The regulation, and the flawed notice in the recent times has added further pains during the time of COVID-19 pandemic.   The massive reservation for government employees will stifle opportunities for others leading to doctors pursuing medical education and careers abroad. Even now hundreds of doctors leave Nepal every year pursuing education and careers in the USA and the UK. In fact the 100 plus Nepali doctors who matched for the US residency programs for 2020 flew to the USA in chartered airplane in June in the middle of the pandemic. A study by the Center for Investigative Journalism (CIJ) has found that up to 60% of doctors who had studied MBBS under government scholarship leave Nepal for opportunities abroad. Policies like this will push more doctors in that direction  As the merit-based selection system is weakened, the quality of residency programs in the hospital will be severely compromised ultimately resulting in poor healthcare services. Also, as government employees are given free passes to post graduate seats, it will discourage hard work and incentivize mediocrity ensuring government-run health centers will always remain mediocre.  If this crosses over to other fields, it will totally ruin academia in Nepal. Imagine 40% of all post graduate academic seats in all areas reserved for the government employees!  Way Out  The field of medical education has always been the go-to field for opposition of affirmative action. Reservations for post graduate studies makes little sense in any field. There should not be any reservation in Post Graduate Medical Education–neither based on caste nor employment.   A fair merit-based system will foster a competitive residency program which will strengthen health care services. The MEC should only go forward with the exam after correcting the unfair and corrupt reservation in the regulation. It should be done swiftly so that the PG entrance exams which have already been delayed for four months are not pushed back much further.\\xa0\\n(The author has been working as a staff physician in Charikot Hospital for two and a half years)\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nFor centuries, we Nepalis have dreamed of owning real estate before we retire. We may link real estate with prestige and a safe investment vehicle, which is why we want to possess it. We also wish to use real estate to produce passive income to help with our monthly or recurrent bills and relieve financial stress after retirement. However, a lack of liquidity, lesser cash flow (from rentals), expensive repair costs, and having to deal with tenants (both good and bad) can all be major roadblocks to landlords achieving their objectives. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are financial structures used by countries such as the United States and India to hold real estate and avoid these issues. REITs, on the other hand, do not exist in Nepal, so Nepali investors are missing out on this potential.\\nFirst, let's understand REITs. They are companies that own or finance income-producing real estate across a range of property sectors and are mostly traded on the stock exchange. They typically own commercial properties such as towers, shopping malls, apartment buildings, hospitals, and care facilities, which create higher rental yields and an increase in value. They are required by law to pay the bulk of their taxable profit to their investors in the form of dividends (usually 90%). Dividends are given out on a monthly or quarterly basis. Let's look at some of the biggest concerns with real estate ownership and how REITs can help.\\n\\nHigh-cost barrier to entry: Over the last decade, real estate prices have skyrocketed. Within a decade, a property purchased for Rs 300,000 per aana on the outskirts of Butwal has increased in value to Rs 2 million. It is really difficult for an average Nepali with an average job to acquire land in big cities, where prices start at Rs 1 million per aana. To be able to purchase them, you'll need to save for years. REITs are available for purchase at a fraction of the price of common or preferred shares on the stock exchange where they are traded. This will ensure that everyone will be able to invest in REITs.\\nLower capital gain: Because we don't have REITs in Nepal, we can't make a direct comparison between their performance and that of real estate. Using data from the United States, which has seen a boom in real estate gains, we can show that REITs outperform real estate by a significant margin. As seen in the graph, Vanguard Real Estate ETFs (VNQ) returned 100.92 percent capital gain from 2010 to 2021, whereas the average real estate return was 44 percent throughout the same time period. Only four states have surpassed VNQ's performance throughout this time span.\\nLower cash flow opportunity: One of the most lucrative aspects of owning real estate for retirees is the ability to generate cash flow or rents. As shown in the graph, REIT dividend yield beats total state rent collection by over 45 percent in the United States.\\n\\nEven in Nepal, a Rs 40 million property in Kathmandu (identical to the one I'm renting for my office) brings in Rs 20,000 per month per floor. Two floors are rented out, while the third serves as a living area for the landlords. As a result, it earns Rs 40,000 thousand while saving you Rs 20,000 meaning Rs 60,000 per month, or Rs 720,000 per year. This is only a 1.8 percent gain. VNQ may create Rs 1.46 million per year and Rs 121,666.67 per month with the same amount of money at a 3.65% return - the amount of money needed to live comfortably in Nepal.\\n\\nRisk management: While real estate is a low-risk, high-yielding investment, REITs diversify it and make it even safer. REITs own a variety of income-producing properties in a variety of industries. Even if one property or industry fails, they will still be able to make money from the remaining ones. It will, however, be extremely difficult for the average real estate investor to replicate.\\nLiquidity issue: Selling and buying property is a time-consuming process that takes 30-45 days from listing to closing, which can be troublesome if liquidity is required. REITs, on the other hand, can be sold with a single click and money deposited into your bank account within a week (at max).\\n\\nIn 2020, an investor who invested $135,000 in the United States in 2010 would have made $98,753.76 in dividends (73 percent return) and $135,000 in capital gain (100 percent return). At the same time period, a real estate investor would have made $26,668.39 in rents (19.75 percent return) and $59,710.5 in capital gain (44.23 percent), while being exposed to all the risks mentioned above. REITs investors (173 percent total return) would be 109.02 percent ($147,177) better off than investors in real estate (63.98 percent total return).\\nWhile there are dangers associated with REITs like fees, tax treatment, and investing in unsuitable or maturing REITs, they also provide an opportunity for investors to earn passive income while avoiding risks. In countries like the United States, many mutual funds and retirees have taken advantage of this to achieve early retirement or a safer retirement. REITs reduce or eliminate issues such as liquidity (in comparison to real estate, which takes time to trade), maintenance costs, and dealing with tenants, as well as lowering risk and providing increased cash flow, capital gain, and a lower barrier to entry. For investors, introducing REITs to Nepal would be a fantastic opportunity.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nIn almost all the polls conducted prior to the 2016 presidential election in the US, Hillary Clinton led Trump in every age group except one: Trump convincingly beat her among those 65 or older. Trump spoke of a time when America was supposedly great and told the country that he wanted to restore America’s greatness once again. His speeches regularly drummed up the anxieties of social change, the nostalgia about an imagined past, and the unfounded claim that there was an existential threat looming over America primarily because America’s culture was unravelling from within and there were external forces trying to take down America from without.\\nPerhaps that doesn’t sound too alien to Nepali ears because right now that is what we are witnessing from the elderly Nepali elites, especially those who have big presence in the social media—those ever ready to blame federalism, secularism, the new Constitution, the new republic, and anything in between for all things bad happening around them. The Nepali elderly elites—those who were able to reap the most benefits from the unitary, Kathmandu-centric, unsecular, nominally democratic system under the monarchy—want us to believe that if not for them, Nepal as a nation-state would no longer be existent on the map.\\nWhat explains this revanchist mood among the elderly elites? Writing for the popular psychology magazine “Psychology Today,” the psychologist and author Thomas Chamorro claims that, as we get older, our diminishing level of curiosity stunts our openness to experience; the gradual decrease in our information-processing capacity makes us see things in more categorical or black and white terms; and our desire for order and structure balks at proactive adaptation, effort, and improvisation. Further, psychologists have also pointed out that the moral values one grows up with or the worldview one is taught as a child plays a huge role on people’s notion of right and wrong, which often lasts for a lifetime. Perhaps, that partly explains why our elderly elites are dyspeptic about recent changes. In the Brexit referendum of 2016, for example, 72 percent of those aged between 18 to 24 voted “remain” but still lost to those who voted “leave” because people over the age of 65 had disproportionate impact on the referendum results.\\n“Despite young people having to live with the decision of the referendum for an average of 69 years, it has been decided for them by people who will only have to live with it for an average of 16 years,” wrote one graduate student for the magazine Vox. “Put simply: The long-term effect of Brexit will not be felt by those who overwhelmingly voted for it. Because they will be dead.”\\nBecause the elders have less stake in the future of the country, they are skeptical about changes regardless of whether they are positive or negative, and are more inclined to look backwards, mostly to an imagined past when everything was supposedly hunky-dory. Whereas the youths, owing to their aspirations about the times ahead, are less fearful and more accepting of the social changes.\\nYoung Bob Dylan spoke of this general trend in his song “The Times They Are A-Changin’” when he sang, “Come mothers and fathers/ Throughout the land/ And don’t criticize/ What you can’t understand/ Your sons and your daughters/ Are beyond your command/ Your old road is rapidly agin’/ Please get out of the new one/ If you can’t lend your hand/ For the times they are a-changin’.” Dylan wrote this song in the 1960s as an “archetypal protest anthem” when the Blacks in America were fighting for equal rights under the law.\\nThe counterculture movement that developed in the Western world between mid-1960s to mid-1970s accelerated the Civil Rights Movement, the Feminist Movement, the Free Speech Movement and raised awareness against the traditional and mostly arbitrary modes of authority that directly or indirectly controlled people’s lives in the Western world.\\nTo expect an equivalent movement from Nepali youths, however, would be to ask too much from them, for the youths in our country are mostly happy to remain as the ideological appendages of the elders, failing to carve out their own individual identity while inheriting the blinkered worldview that defines the hoary heads.\\nUnfortunately, our youths are happy playing monkeys in the streets parroting the boilerplate lines that flows from their leaders, obsessing with the latest brands of bikes, and vying for greener pastures in faraway lands at the first opportune moment. I bring this up because I don’t think this is so much an indictment of the youths as it is of their parents who have thwarted the critical thinking abilities of their kids.\\n“Enlightenment is man’s release from his self-incurred tutelage,” claimed Immanuel Kant, the eighteenth-century German philosopher—unfortunately, our parents (I include myself as well) haven’t received the memo even after these many centuries. The elder elites know that there will be no one to mount any challenge on their authority, not at least any time soon. Perhaps that too explains the solipsism, the puffed up feeling of one’s indispensability that we see in our elderly elites.\\nBefore anybody accuse me of being a tradition-defying nihilist, here’s a blog What will the conservatives conserve? that I wrote a week ago which tries to show my appreciation of conservative values. However, the conservatism that we see in Nepal, I believe, is too backward, atavistic, and hence indefensible in so many ways. There is an urgent need to reimagine our national identity such that a vast majority feels included in the democratic process, and federalism and secularism provide us the mid-way forward. Of course, it may not be the only way, but it is the mid-way mark that we have reached to incorporate the voices of dissent that have festered in our societies for many years. We also need to keep in mind that if we are to forestall any demands on “multi-national autonomous states”(which I think will be disastrous for a country like ours) we need to find a middle ground around political principles like constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. In order to do that the elderly elites need to trust the process and stop sowing doubts in the population about federalism, secularism and the new Constitution. The Constitution must be seen as a living document that is amenable to change through amendments and will invariably do so toward forming a just and equitable Nepal.\\nIn the lead up to the 2016 election in the US, an article titled “The Flight 93 Election,” authored under a pseudonym, made a huge splash in the conservative circles of the country. In it, the author had quite dramatically analogized the 2016 election to one of the planes, United Airlines Flight 93, that was highjacked by al-Qaeda terrorists on September 11, 2001, and had asked the readers what they would do under the circumstances? Whether they would charge the cockpit even though they didn’t know how to fly or land the plane, or they would simply do nothing—not even try—and wait for their deaths which was certain? For the author Hillary’s presidency meant that death was certain, whereas Trump’s meant that they would still have the chance of survival because it would mean that they had charged the cockpit and taken control of the plane even if they didn’t know what was going to happen next. The conservatives charged the cockpit, elected Trump, and floundered with the country for next four years. It seems that our elderly elites feel the same about federalism, secularism, and the new republic—they want us to think that if they don’t charge the cockpit Nepal will cease to exist. Well, it will be great if we took some lessons from four years of Trump.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThere was a time when I regularly visited conservative media news sites. In fact, I still do although the frequency has considerably decreased these days. I consume conservative media not only because I like listening to and reading all viewpoints and challenging my own opinions, but also because I genuinely think that the conservative thinkers have got a lot of things right—especially about the human nature and the nature of society—that has been proven to be true time and again in history.\\nContrary to common misconception, conservative thinkers are not a monolithic block of people who think alike in all situations. The nuances that go into forming their ideologies is as intricate and thoughtful as any; and is based on a deep realism about history, culture, society, and human psychology. Take the case of Edmund Burke, the patron saint and founder of modern-day conservatism from the eighteenth century, for example. While Burke adamantly stood against any kind of revolution à la the French Revolution from taking place in England, he also stood against the English monarchy when it came to the treatment of the colonized people. He supported the sovereignty of the colonized based on the recognition of their rights and led the impeachment trial against Warren Hastings, the erstwhile Governor-General of Bengal, who was accused of corruption and maltreatment of the Indian people. He was a Whig who regularly voiced his opposition against King George III’s government and advocated against England’s policies in support of the revolutionaries in America for which the Americans feel indebted to this day.\\nIn Reflections on the Revolution in France published in 1790, a year after the fall of Bastille, Burke urged caution against any radical changes and declared that the “society is a partnership of the dead, the living and the unborn”—a quote that is invoked ad nauseam by many conservative thinkers, often without full realization of its meaning. Burke doubted the efficacy of the changes brought by “social engineering” and argued in favor of change that was gradual and organic. The spiral of violence that lasted for generations in post-revolutionary France in fact vindicated Burke, who slowly but surely, was put on a pedestal by thinkers of conservative persuasion who later followed in his footsteps. Burke wasn’t only suspicious of radical changes, but also questioned whether reason and human rationality alone could solve human afflictions. Given Burke’s skepticism about the efficacy of social engineering via radical change and his pessimism about human nature, I have often wondered what Burke would think of the changes in Nepal.\\nIn his book The Conservative Mind, the American political thinker Russell Kirk, writes: “Burke has no expectation that men can be kept from social change; neither is rigidity of form desirable. Change is inevitable and is designed providentially for the larger conservation of society; properly guided, change is a process of renewal.” In other words, Burke supports social change as long as it is properly guided and done in a piecemeal manner because change leads to renewal of our societies and an even greater bonding in our communities. “A state without the means of some change,” Burke contends, “is without the means of its conservation.” Further, with respect to equality, Burke writes:\\nWhatever each man can separately do, without trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its combinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this partnership all men have equal rights; but not to equal things.\\nBurke was indeed not an egalitarian and did believe in social hierarchies; however, he did also strongly believe that equal justice is a natural right while equal dividend is not. He anticipated the follies and violence of communism—which tries to level societies in the name of distributing equal dividend—way ahead than most and was again proved correct by what transpired in the USSR and China in the early- and mid-twentieth century. Burke also supported the civil rights of Catholics, a religious minority, in England which cost him his parliamentary seat and stood staunchly against the practice of slavery. In replying to an anti-Catholic demagogue in the British parliament, Burke once proclaimed, “The only religion I profess is that of universal humanity and benevolence.”\\nNow, if we compare the general idea of Burke’s notion of equality and social change against the backdrop of the Nepali context, it compels us to take stock of several facts still prevalent in our society. First thing that comes to mind is the notion of human dignity: whereas conservatism, in its modern iteration, has, if only reluctantly, come to accept the individual as a sovereign and human dignity as inherent in all men and women; Nepali conservatism, on the other hand, has hardly budged from its centuries-old mindset. A large section of the population is still treated as less than human simply because they were born in the wrong caste, or the wrong geographical region, or in the wrong religion. In so far as the conservatives alienate and find excuses to exclude these groups of people from a shared transcendental national identity, conservatism, as a social and political power, Burke would argue, is bound to atrophy by the day.\\nSecond fact that would most likely rile Burke would be the way religion is practiced in our country. Whether we admit it or not, a lot of the social ills stem from the way our religion is conceived. Religion, no doubt, provides an anchor to our lives and guides us through both psychological and materialistic deficiencies; it inspires us to appreciate the beauty and the sublime. Hence, there is no point in fighting back religion for it will remain so long as the mankind survives, and it is a glue that holds our culture together. However, there is an urgent need to reimagine our religion so that it incorporates and responds to modern sensibilities. Mere lip-service will not suffice, people need to seriously change the way they think to regain the trust of the minorities—for starters, questioning your own privileges that have no ties to science and reason would be an essential first step. Accepting secularism as one of our national creeds would be another: a nation where more than eighty percent of the population follow Hinduism doesn’t need to cry wolf when secularism might in fact enlarge the tent and attract more followers.\\nThird, Burke would say that we need to reimagine our nationality identity such that Nepalis from every geographical region feel included and heard in the decision-making mechanism of the country. If monarchy and religion were something that propped up our national identity in the past, we now need to foster a new identity, perhaps something along the lines of what Francis Fukuyama calls the “creedal identity,” based on political principles such as constitutionalism, the rule of law, and democratic accountability. Any more strain on the national identity can prove fatal for our country, so the more inclusive we become, the stronger our national identity becomes. As a country we need to work toward bringing the disillusioned into the fold and that should be done by enlarging our hearts and minds, not by turning inward and cocooning ourselves.\\nAmong other things Burke would also probably take issue with runaway consumerism, the destruction of the environment, and a civil society which is destructively divided along party lines. Our civil society is in urgent need of a renewal where interpersonal relations are not just built on a political basis but also in various other ways such as community service, sports, reading clubs etc. We need to find ways other than party politics to establish bonds among fellow citizens and create trust among each other.\\nConservatives can play a constructive role in the remaking of a modern Nepal that is open, free, democratic, tolerant, and just. Conservatives can no longer support an edifice of governance that perpetuates structural discrimination, and still believe to be relevant in modern day politics. Thankfully, the chasms we see in our country are not irreconcilable, not at least anywhere near what we see in the US or even in India, where communal violence is often stoked for political gains. Conservatism is a necessary force; it’s just that the conservatives need to find the right ideas to conserve.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nA couple of days ago a friend of mine tagged me on a Facebook post shared by the radio-journalist-turned-politician Rabindra Mishra. “The guy has finally come out of the closet,” he wrote, adding his bit on the link before sharing it on his own Facebook wall. Bibeksheel Sajha Party President Mishra—a neophyte in the Nepali political scene who has continuously touted the merits of “alternative politics”—had apparently put out a manifesto where he argued for the abolition of federalism and called for a plebiscite to decide the future of secularism in Nepal. It was ironical that a politician who has essentially built up his political career riding the backs of progressive youths in the country had recycled and repackaged his deeply held personal prejudices and was serving as an “alternative” the same old ideas of militant majoritarianism that brought us here in the first place. It was ironical but not very surprising.\\nMishra until now had parried away questions relating to his political ideology by appealing to a sort of “transcendental ideology” where ideologies, in the old sense, would be non-existent and instead there would be an ad hoc application of all kinds of political principles. He has finally ended up dashing the hopes of thousands of forward-looking youths who strive for a just and equitable tomorrow. By parasitically tapping into the deep wells of energy, positivity, optimism, and vigor of the youths from his party, Mishra has not only betrayed their agendas but also revealed his opportunistic and reactionary side—perhaps the only side—that is bent on misleading the movement of the youths in the country. His proposal wasn’t surprising also because a lot of us had already guessed that by hewing to no ideology at all, Mishra was in fact aiming to curry favor from the ancien regime which has been eagerly waiting for its own resurrectionist. No sooner had he revealed his manifesto, the chattering class of Kathmandu, a place that is as callous as it is disdainful and apathetic to the rest of the country, expressed a collective sigh of relief for here was a man who has finally spoken their mind.\\nIn a gleeful taunt aimed at people who were dismayed by Mishra’s newfound regressive ideology and, perhaps, at Mishra himself, the TV talk show host Vijay Kumar Panday, tweeted that Mishra wasn’t saying anything new at all; rather it was the people whose “legs were made of straw”—translation: those who support secularism and federalism \\xa0were overly reacting to a commonly expressed view. Another TV show host Bhushan Dahal, known for his mawkish nostalgia toward the ousted monarchy, put out an encouraging tweet backing Mishra and urging him, in his own roundabout style, to stick to his agenda at all costs and prove his mettle.\\nWhat these tweeting heads do not consider is that just because there is a majority which potentially supports their agendas of dissolution of federalism and establishment of a Hindu kingdom doesn’t mean that the nation needs to blindly follow their unrestrained passions. They forget that Nepal, as a country, is a representative democracy with an established Constitution, which is in fact inherently suspicious of and hostile toward any form of majoritarianism. And, yes, the Constitution is there precisely because it needs to protect the “legs of straw” of the minorities who have historically been bereft of their voices. That is what federalism and secularism do: they allow for people from all faiths (or no faith at all), class, caste, and geographical regions to feel included in the decision-making process of this democratic country. To be sure, Nepali federalism is not without its faults, not least because of leaders who operate with the feudal mindset. However, those questioning the legitimacy and efficacy of federalism and secularism need to understand that federalism in Nepal was not instituted to address the needs of the Kathmandu dwellers who were already well off. There is not going to be any drastic change in the lives of people like Rabindra Mishra. Rather, it was instituted to be responsive to and redress the grievances of the historically marginalized who have finally, if only in fits and starts, found their voices.\\nBeside his deep-seated suspicion toward federalism and secularism, Mishra’s proposal is also representative of something more insidious that passes as intellectuality in the Nepali intellectual sphere: it showcases extreme egocentrism and ethnocentrism probably rooted in the Brahminical knows-it-all psyche which is reluctant to question its own privileges and tone down its elitism. Whether they see the connection or not, Mishra and his ilk are essentially arguing in support of a system that has, for centuries, denied the minorities of their individual dignity and humanity. Both federalism and secularism seek to redress the deficiencies in our society, and they depend on the honesty and integrity of the leaders who pledge to abide by its principles. If there is anything that needs to change, it is the mindset of our leaders—not the Constitution. The Constitution is working just fine as recently demonstrated by the landmark decision from the Supreme Court. Of course, it needs to be more and more inclusive, but there is no need to jump off the cliff with Mishra.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nImagine a job interview where the interviewer asks the candidate to mention five good traits about themselves. But instead of a candidate with a masters' degree and an excellent resume you have a student from maybe the fifth grade or the second grade on the chair. What answer do you expect?\\nWell, I tried finding that by conducting a small survey among students from the second to the seventh grades in March 2021. I asked them to write five good and five bad things about themselves on a piece of paper. There were six classes, and each class had around 22 students on average. I collected their papers and noted the most repeated traits. In this piece of writing, I have tried to present an overview on the students’ beliefs and how they tend to concur with some pre-existing theories of moral development.\\nStudents in grade six and seven mentioned that they are good at friendships. They respect the elders and they always do their homework on time. They follow traffic rules and cross the road through zebra crossings. As bad traits, they mentioned that they get irritated and angry easily. They use their mobile phones or watch television a lot and don’t sleep on time. Some of them even said that they cheat during exams.\\nIn grade four and five, students mentioned they do their homework every day and they are polite. They help their mother in household chores, respect elders and they have really good handwriting. They also cleaned their room themselves. Sharing their bad traits they wrote that they have little control over anger and patience. They sometimes get angry at friends and family and say things that they don’t mean. They are also aware of the fact that they hurt others’ feelings knowingly or unknowingly. Some peculiar responses however, were the ones mentioning that they don't like religions other than their own, some being addicted to TikTok and some saying that they don't like pink color.\\nThe notes from grades three and two were quite interesting. It is the phase when children start developing their preliminary sense of good and bad. For good traits, they also mentioned helping their mother in house chores, throwing the waste in the dustbin and waking up early. They thought it was good that they shared food and other things like pencils and erasers with their friends. Not doing homework on time, watching a lot of television or having bad handwriting was a bad trait for them. They also kept\\xa0 losing their items (pencils, erasers, etc) and they didn’t speak in English during the classes. Some said that they make noise in the class and get angry very easily. The responses from this group which really got my attention were ‘I am fatting’ (getting fat) and ‘I am not good at social’ (socializing).\\nWhile looking at the wide variety of responses from the children about the good and bad traits, we should not forget that they aren’t the ones who dictated those traits for themselves. The notion of good and bad traits is not inherited but it rather comes from an individual’s sense of morality. According to Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget’s theory of moral development, children are in the heteronomous phase which can be identified by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one’s life, such as parents, teachers, and those rules are permanent no matter what. Children , in large part, are also influenced by the prize and punishment norm where good behavior is rewarded and bad behavior is punished. The severity of punishment is also directly proportional to the bad behavior. Thus, children regard consequences more important than the action that will cause it. For example: a student with the fear of failing exams might end up cheating in exams to pass despite knowing that cheating is a bad thing to do.\\nThis phase is seen in children from the age of five. As they grow into\\xa0 adults they enter the autonomous phase where the action itself is seen as more important than its consequences. They begin to understand that different people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal.\\nAmerican psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg expanded this theory on a stage model similar to Piaget’s, and proposed three levels with six stages of moral development. Individuals create their realm of morality from the universal experiences of punishment and rewards, approval and disapproval from the society, community respect and disrespect as well as self-condemnation. He named the three levels: pre-conventional, conventional, and post-conventional, each accommodating two stages. For the survey I conducted, Kohlberg’s first and second levels of moral development would be in focus.\\nThe first or pre-conventional level has two stages: Stage 1—ethics of obedience and punishment in which an individual’s sense of morality is motivated by the desire to avoid punishment and Stage 2—ethics of self-interest where an individual’s morality is based on whether an activity serves them back or not. These stages can be seen in motion with the responses from students where they believed that doing homework on time and sharing food as well as other items with their friends was a good thing to do.\\nThe second or conventional level also has two stages: Stage 3—ethics of social norms and Stage 4—ethics of law and order. In stage 3 individuals shape their actions and mindset according to the approval or disapproval they are getting from the social construct around them. The responses from children where they believe that respecting elders and helping their mother in household chores is a good trait perhaps comes from the approval that arrives after those actions. More or less it is the desire to be tagged as a ‘good child’. Stage 4 shapes the idea of morality in an individuality based on their culpability and presence of a central law. They have to be more responsible regarding their action or inaction. One person violating a law might initiate a chain reaction which results in everyone doing the same thus a duty to uphold laws and rules comes as an obligation. Stage 4 can be seen being reflected on the students’ notion of following traffic rules (present in older students from 6-7th grades) and speaking English in school (present in younger students below the 6th grade)\\xa0 as good traits.\\nI took this survey to understand each class better; their problems and their strengths and how I can help them as a teacher and mentor. After getting these answers from them, I feel like I have got a chance to know them better. It was surprising to discover that the notion of good and bad traits that my friends and I had a decade ago while we were in school is more or less similar to that these present-day children have. We had very little control over anger or patience. We too wanted to be socially accepted as ‘good boy’ or ‘good girl’. I believe all of us undergo a lot of ‘learning’ as a child but as we grow up into adults both ‘learning’ and ‘unlearning’ is equally necessary.\\nOn a side note, many students mentioned watching television a lot in the survey. Back when I was in school a decade ago, smart phones were not so mainstream in my town. But we watched television a lot. As the internet and smartphones proliferated I had grown this notion that maybe young people don’t watch television as much (or not at all). However, I was wrong, television is here to stay. Every generation loves to assume and comment regarding the upcoming generations without realizing some of those assumptions and comments might be far from truth. It would have never occurred to me that ‘fatting’ or body appearance would find space in a second grade student’s morality. This whole ordeal has ultimately taught me the importance of honest conversations with children which might be difficult as parents and schools grow busier.\\n(The author is a maths teacher for grade 12 and a computer teacher for the lower secondary level)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWastewater is a complex mixture containing contaminated water from sewers, storm runoff from streets, lawns, farms, and other land areas, generated at both household and industrial scale. As such, there is a possibility of the presence of debris from streets, vehicle spillovers, pesticides, fertilizers, and human as well as animal waste. The mixture thus becomes a potential carrier of various types of microbes, harmful chemicals, heavy metals, and other hazards. The practice of disposal of treated wastewater into the river or other water bodies is quite common in developing countries. Such practices include direct disposal of partially treated or untreated wastewater in the rivers and subsequently to groundwater sources. The wastewater discharged into the river systems in developing countries exceed the threshold limit of 2-5 cubic meter per day set by the Environmental Protection Agency, a US-based regulatory body that sets a guideline for environmental assessment, research and education. Given the increased demand for water and shortage of its supply, people from developing countries rely on underground water sources. The utilization of these contaminated groundwaters by humans may pose a significant health risk to human, resulting in the occasional outbreaks of water-borne diseases.\\nHistory and significances of wastewater surveillance\\nWastewater treatment plant is the ultimate destination of all the harmful substances produced on the surface of the earth. Surveillance of the wastewater is fundamental in determining the harmful content that might get transported through the surface water or remains stacked in the underground aquifers. Regular monitoring of wastewater may provide an alternative medium for early warning of a potential outbreak in future, as such, the field of wastewater based epidemiology (WBE) is of growing interest among scientists globally.\\nWBE usually includes analysis of water to monitor public health indicators and to measure the load of pathogens in a community including SARS-CoV-2. The history of WBE dates back to the mid-1800s (1849-1854) during the cholera epidemic in Great Britain. In the early days of the epidemic, cholera was assumed to be an air-borne disease and not waterborne. John Snow, a British physician currently known as the father of modern epidemiology, studied death rates in two different districts that supplied water from a particular section of Thames river in London and proposed that cholera was a water-borne disease.\\nThe term WBE was used for monitoring drug consumption for the first time in 2001. Later, in 2005, this approach was applied by a group of researchers in Italy to estimate the usage of cocaine. However, before the aforementioned two instances, the application of wastewater surveillance system in disease surveillance had already been adopted by the researchers in Israel to monitor polio outbreaks in 1988. The data generated by this environmental surveillance can be utilized by epidemiologist to describe the burden of disease in the population and its trend by applying modelling approaches, which allows decision-makers to respond rapidly toward the management of outbreaks. There has been sufficient evidence of the performance of wastewater surveillance for enteric viruses (major causes of gastroenteritis and reproduction in a human host). The approach has successfully monitored the spatial and temporal extent of enteric virus circulation in different countries\\nFuture possibilities on wastewater surveillance\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be discharged through human feces. Researchers all over the world have been developing a standard protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material from wastewater using WBE, for designing early warning systems to alert the presence of the pathogen in a given community. The WBE technique is cost-effective and comparatively less time-consuming. Although least developed countries do not have a centralized system for sewage collection and treatment, investigating samples collected from the open sewer pipe, drainage, decentralized sewage system from the community can be helpful in identifying infection hotspots and tracking the waves of disease transmission.\\nIn the case of SARS-CoV-2, there is chance of discharge of viruses from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. The asymptomatic carriers can be a possible source of shedding the viruses into the environment, thereby enhancing the potential transmission of diseases within the community. Therefore, identifying the asymptomatic carriers is necessary to track the source of infection and break the chain of disease transmission. Identifying asymptomatic carriers is, however, a challenging task that requires well-trained personnel, and is expensive as well as tedious. Therefore, monitoring of wastewater is an important alternative prospect for early warning systems to determine the presence of diseases in a given community, and can help prevent spread of diseases. In addition, the wastewater monitoring approach can be integrated with several other technologies to discover undetermined issues related to the population. This environmental approach could be of high value to scientists and policymakers globally for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for lower middle income countries with poor resources and financial capacity.\\n(A PhD in Environmental Engineering, the author is a research fellow at Policy ResearchInstitute and can be reached at sar1234tan@gmail.com )\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe global population of Asiatic elephant has been estimated at around 48,323–51,680 in the wild (Menon and Tiwari 2019). The number of elephants in the world has been quickly declining over the past several decades. Wild Asian elephants (Elephans maximus) is classified as endangered species in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list and\\xa0 Appendix I species in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\\nThe Bardia National Park (BNP) is one of the largest and diverse protected areas (IUCN Category II) in tarai covering an area of 968 square kilometers. This national park has a long success story in conservation. Bardia is home to nearly 80 elephants, about one-third of the total population in the country. Proper management of grassland, a large number of water bodies, and floodplains make this national park a suitable habitat for elephants. The role of elephants in the forest ecosystem is very vital and they are symbolized as ‘ecosystem engineers' and commonly referred to as a 'keystone' species. Similarly, elephants are an integral part of our culture and heritage. In the Hindu religion, the elephant is a sacred animal and is worshipped as the living incarnation of Lord Ganesh.\\nDrivers of human-elephant conflict\\nThe Asiatic elephant is an herbivore which can eat about 150 kilograms of plant materials in its active eating duration of 16 hours a day. These giant animals prefer to live in a large evergreen forest for their survival and their long-ranging habits inevitably bring them in direct contact with humans leading to conflict. Dr Dinesh Neupane’s research article on “Status, patterns, and potential mitigation of human-elephant conflict in Nepal and elephant habitat use in Bardia National Park, Nepal” showed that only 20% of the total area in BNP was highly favorable for elephants which may not be sufficient to hold the existing numbers.\\nElephants are reported as the leading cause of crop raiding and degradation, and communities also often suffer property damage, human injuries, and deaths. Traditional farming practices such as growing rice and maize, planting banana trees in yards, and fermenting alcohol inside the home attract this megafauna in the human landscape. The low-level subsistence farmers living near protected areas depend on the forest resources increasing risks of conflict. Poverty also reduces a household’s coping ability and adaptive capacity to respond to elephant damages. Population growth, habitat fragmentation, regular highway activities are few other drivers of human-elephant conflict in Bardia.\\nInvasive plant species such as Chromolaena odorata and Lantana camara inside protected areas modify plant community structure which reduces plant species richness and diversity affecting food resources for elephants.\\nStatus in Bardia\\nOne Nareswor Sapkota, 78, from Basgadhi municipality 8 Baishapur was trampled to death on June 16. Altogether 41 human fatalities and 115 human injuries were reported in Bardia since 2000. Three persons have lost their lives since mid-April which shows the severity of the problem. Retaliatory killing of elephants is not seen but a few were injured during conflict. This issue is gaining more and more attention in conservation. The\\xa0 nature of each conflict is completely different from another, which is one of the great challenges in managing the conflict. Recently a herd of wild elephants entered Bardia through Khata Corridor from Katarniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary in India which is becoming a matter of concern.\\nMitigation practices \\nThe concrete cement walls and electric wires installed in the fringe of the forest are the most effective applied mitigation measures to mitigate human-elephant conflict in Bardia, according to the research article titled “Human-Elephant Conflict and Mitigation Measures in Buffer Zone of Bardia National Park, Nepal” by Rabin Paudel and team. Application of repellant methods such as firecrackers, drums, and acoustic deterrents are practiced in some areas to ward the tuskers away. Cottage like structure (machan) is constructed to look out for elephants entering agriculture lands.\\nUS-funded Hariyo Ban Program is providing support to local people in large-scale commercial citrus lemon farming. There is a provision of financial compensation to those who are affected by human-elephant conflict. However, people are not satisfied with these packages due to insufficient compensation, logistical challenges, lack of transparency, reduced local understanding of program scope and limitations, and fraudulent claims.\\nThe World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), and a few cooperatives are becoming successful in helping women, youths, and forest-dependent marginalized families to start their own small-scale agriculture and eco-tourism based business thereby reducing pressure on forest and biodiversity. Capacity building and awareness programs are necessary to change the perception of people toward elephants.\\nIdentification of problematic elephants is necessary and their regular monitoring using radio collar is crucial. The BNP in support of the IUCN, the Global Nature Fund, and Ujyalo Nepal has started a program “Hatti Khabar” in Tiger FM to disseminate information to the public regarding elephant activities.\\nLong-term habitat enriching methods such as fodder plantations, soil management, and creating water resources like water holes inside the forest are also being implemented. Management of forest fire, grassland, and invasive plant species is necessary to restrict these megafaunas inside the forest. Forest corridors have also proved to be a critical connection for migratory elephants.\\nWay forward\\nMore research is needed to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of human-elephant conflict in Bardia. Conflict mitigation cannot be solved by the BNP alone. It requires multidisciplinary collaboration between different levels of government, INGOs, NGOs, indigenous tharu community, women groups, biologists, media, and locals in formulating conflict mitigating plans which also helps to strengthen the human-elephant co-existence. No single solution is effective and different management approaches need to be integrated to address the problem proactively.\\n(The author is currently pursuing Master's in Biodiversity and Environmental Management at the Tribhuvan University, Kirtipur)\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThere is a reason why they say, ‘bureaucracy is a giant mechanism run by pygmies’. Sounds pretty harsh, but sad reality of the time we live in. We have always been shown a dream, a dream of better future on all fronts. The dreams, alas, have now turned into ashes, literally ‘ashes’. Yes, I am talking about the crumbling health system which has claimed the lives of many of our near and dear ones.\\nEmotions are running high, high not on substance but on something unusual, the budget for fiscal year 2078/79. This budget has been seen as the most progressive package in 70 years of its history when it comes to health sector, allocating 7.45% for the sector. But the bigger question remains, will government walk the talk, or is it just another gimmick for vote-bank politics?\\nTalking about some of the glitches of this allocation, allow me to put before you some of the thought-provoking questions. Of 7.45%, what percentage has been allocated for the upliftment of long-term fundamentals of health care delivery system? Only miniscule! Most of it seems to address only COVID-19 crisis which is no less than a quick fix. And quick fixes will not contribute to the fundamentals. Rs 4 billion has been allocated for high dependency units (HDU), intensive care units (ICU), ventilators etc. What about human resources? Or, have they been talking about artificial-intelligence driven HDU and ICU? Come on! Have some foresight. The hospital I work in has one ventilator with cobwebs all around. Also, a concept of satellite clinic has been brought up. Well, this is nothing but a smart move to cover up government doctor’s inadequacy statistics by shunting human resources of higher institutions to the periphery. This is certainly not going to help in the long run.\\nGovernments come and go. So much so that we've seen over 20 governments in the past 30 years. What remains is bureaucracy, the backbone of all government bodies. While the leaders have received their fair share of criticism, pinning blame solely on them doesn’t suffice to explain the situation we’ve been witnessing today. Bureaucrats are as responsible for this nightmare as the politicians, if not more. The government can only implement policies if the bureaucrats deliver to the best of their ability. But everything in the end boils down to inefficiency and corruption because there seems to be no ethical limit to their pursuit of money. Today most of the hospitals are spending a fortune in those sector which guarantees them handsome amount of commission. From construction to procurement of equipment, corruption is rampant everywhere. I can say this from my personal experience working as a medical officer at the Sunsari District Hospital in Inaruwa. The pharmacy doesn't have basic medicines. But the hospital premise gets new building year after year for no reason. After completion, they are left unused for years because it was never necessary and what is necessary is nowhere near. What does this tell us? Bureaucracy is no less than a syndicate which has reduced all government hospitals to mere non-functioning garbage. Many potential private hospitals are awaiting validations from the government for the expansion of its service. But the complexity of whole process is so grave that one has to offer a huge amount of money to grease the officials' palm to get go-ahead. Why only money can expedite the whole process and not the will power of bureaucrats? Think about it!\\nThe combined complacency of politicians and bureaucrats has not only undermined the quality of health service but also put the health professionals at the risk of being targeted by patient’s kins like the incident of Bheri Hospital, Binod Mishra's case and many more. Proper maintenance of patient-doctors/nurses ratio, medical equipment like dialysis machine etc, are not the responsibilities of health professionals to watch over. The healthcare system is now under immense stress. So are health workers. Let us provide health services with adequate sense of security deep inside. Well, that's not too much to ask for.\\nAmidst all doom and gloom, the authorities concerned have yet another chance to prove themselves in this moment of crisis. All it takes is commitment and a radical revolutionary approach because we can’t solve the problem by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them, as Einstein said. Or else, bureaucracy will always remain a giant mechanism run by pygmies.\\n(The author is a doctor working at the Sunsari District Hospital in Inaruwa)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nAs I write this, my heart is heavy with grief and smoldering with anger. Just today there was news of nurses getting mobbed and attacked by the relatives of a patient. It is deeply saddening to see incidents like these come up almost every week and makes one really wonder how many of such incidents actually occur weekly. These incidents make big noise and are all over the media for some days only to abate rather quickly without making actual changes to the laws or policies. Different groups of people react differently, some strongly condemn it with hashtags of ‘jailwithoutbail’, the others remark that we should at least not have to hear such news amidst the pandemic and then there are people who find a way to blame the healthcare workers by bringing it down to\\xa0 negligence or lack of communication. There are definitely many factors that fuel the epidemic of violence against healthcare workers, ranging from sheer hooliganism to lack of proper communication. These incidents could easily contribute to burnout which ultimately affects the quality of care that patients receive.\\nHealthcare workers burnout is a complex problem that is often not discussed in our society. It is a work related syndrome characterized by extreme emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a loss of sense of personal accomplishments. In simple words what it means is that they are in a state where they feel they are not in control of their lives, see patients as objects and deem themselves unable to help patients successfully. The factors leading to this state are many. The medical field is a highly demanding one where aspirants learn to prioritize their work before anything else early on. The robust training, followed by long work hours, paperwork and to top all that the struggle to maintain a balanced personal and professional life definitely serves as an alloy leading to burnout. Just the other day I saw a tweet by a doctor who shared a rather woebegone incident of the day his father-in-law committed suicide. He was in the clinic when he received a call from his wife informing him of the sad news and he responded by telling her how he was very busy at the moment and would get back to her later. Needless to say, this triggered a much needed discussion on the sheer impact work and responsibilities have on a physician’s life.\\nA study conducted by a team of Nepali doctors and students, which was published in BMC Psychiatry in 2020 stated that 48.8% out of 651 residents and medical students involved in the study were deduced to be burnt out. The increasing cases of abuse against healthcare workers leave them fearing for their safety; further fueling the likelihood of burnout. While this is definitely bad news for anyone working in the medical field or aspiring to do so, it also comes with implications to the public. In recent years there have been a number of studies that correlate physician burnout and its negative impact on the quality of patient care. Doctors are considered to be god and even expected to behave accordingly. There is no room for any mistake for them. This is why discussing this issue in the medical field is absolutely necessary. People need to see doctors for who they are, a human being trained to provide medical services. They too come with their own flaws.\\nViolence at the healthcare setting is not a problem of Nepal alone. The WHO states that 8-38 % of healthcare workers are subjected to work related physical violence at some point in their career. Many more are abused through verbal aggressions. But in Nepal, a lot of these incidents, especially verbal abuse are not seen as a problem and are never reported. We all know the resolution to this epidemic. We need stricter laws, better security and an overall fall in corruption to ensure implementation of laws. But the grim picture is that these solutions will never really be implemented efficiently or at least not unless doctors and nurses start losing their lives because of it. If not, for the well being of healthcare workers then at least for the sake of quality of health services for the public, I hope positive change in some form will be introduced. Until then it is probably in everyone’s best interest that medical students are taught some form of self defense and hospitals are made with hidden corners where we can go to hide when our lives are being threatened.\\n(The author is currently studying in the third year of MBBS at Maharajgunj Medical Campus)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nCOVID-19 has overwhelmed the health system across the globe. Sixty-five Nepali resident doctors in Delhi have been tirelessly treating COVID patients for over a year. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), the premier medical institute of India, has been reluctant to recognize even our basic human rights. We have dependent families back home in Nepal but are sharing the workload of patient care amidst the \\xa0raging COVID-19 crisis in India without an honorarium. We are among the frontline warriors in the fight against COVID, whether at the AIIMS COVID Emergency Area, COVID screening area or at the Intensive Care Unit. The immense delay and apathy toward providing financial security to those of us who are working away from our home country, has increased psychological stress over and above the financial crisis. Nearly all of us have been infected with the deadly disease, with a few needing oxygen support, and have had a hard time to recover. We are in India during a crisis, helping India recover, but are not being taken care of, neither by the Indian Health Ministry nor our own institute.\\nWe have come to India for a post-graduate or doctoral level three-year residency training in MD/MCH/MDS/DM in many different specialities and super-specialities at AIIMS. But, because of the raging pandemic, we are bound to care for COVID patients only. This has significantly cut down our training duration. If we were to do the same training in the US or UK or any other premier institute anywhere in the globe, we would have been paid a basic living expense. There are three Institutes of National Importance (INIs) in India where foreign nationals come to complete residency after clearing the INI CET exam (Institute of National Importance Combined Entrance Test). Other two institutes--the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) in Chandigarh and the Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) in Puducherry--pay foreign nationals for the work they do but AIIMS does not.\\nWe are not sponsored by the Government of Nepal which has only issued a no objection certificate to be admitted for training as foreign nationals in India. We write the same entrance exams, pass a common national test same as our Indian counterparts to get enrolled in the same course, purely and entirely based on merit, among hugely competitive seats dedicated to any foreign national across the world. We perform the same type of duty for the same duration as our Indian counterparts. Amid the raging second wave of COVID-19 pandemic, we are in extreme financial and psychological crisis with decreasing physical health but are still tirelessly treating COVID-19 patients round the clock, but are unfortunately being ignored for more than a year.\\nThe Delhi High Court in 2013, had directed AIIMS to start paying its foreign doctors on par with Indian doctors. The court had pointed that when it came to a fundamental right available to even non-citizens, to be paid for the work they do, the terms of the prospectus of AIIMS on non-payment to foreign nationals could not be binding. That judgement was later stayed till an appeal filed by AIIMS is adjudicated. The prime minister's office and the Ministry of External Affairs in 2018 then directed the institute to make necessary amendments and release the due salary of the foreign doctors. However, the AIIMS administration is adamant that they will not pay the foreign nationals working as resident doctors. It is noteworthy that even undergraduate and interns are allowed honorarium for COVID duties whereas AIIMS administration is surprisingly unable to draw a distinction between the duties and responsibilities of a professionally trained doctor undergoing post-graduate training from that of interns. The Health Ministry also asked for the financial implications to which AIIMS administration had responded that it would hardly be IRs 60-70 million per annum (a small fraction of AIIMS annual operating budget). We desire for nothing extravagant but are merely asking that we be paid at least daily living expenses for the work we do, which is a basic human right.\\nThe situation has worsened with the pandemic, and we have been reduced to a point of borrowing money in India during a raging crisis when banks are not operating at full capacity due to prohibitory orders in Nepal. Even Indian PM Narendra Modi’s announcement of insurance policy worth IRs 5 million for the frontline health workers who are treating coronavirus patients does not cover us, as we are foreigners.\\nCOVID-19 has led to unprecedented challenges including difficult duty rosters, travel restrictions, quarantine requirements, isolation stressors and concerns about the spread of the deadly virus back home in Nepal. We have been denied even basic payment against the instructions of Indian PM Modi and the Indian Health Ministry. We, therefore, urge the Nepal government and the Nepali Embassy in India to coordinate with the Indian government to help us get paid.\\n(Collective plea of Nepali Residents at AIIMS in India)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0“Tomorrow I am leaving for the far west for a field work on menstruation and today I get my period. \\xa0What a weird coincidence?”\\nI am immediately reminded of my privilege of not having to go to an abandoned hut straight away.\\nThe self-talk was running on my mind just before I went on to my second field work of 2020, the COVID year. My previous field work was in Sarlahi and Janakpur as part of food relief distribution.\\nIt’s been a few years that I have been working for social concerns and I love visiting different communities and meeting the people there but even now field visits give me excitement and anxiety at the same time. Field visits have been an eye opener for me. On many occasions I have been confronted with my own unconscious biases, putting me through many uncomfortable emotions that ultimately help me grow as a person. I always bury some biases and pre-assumptions that I carried about social issues, there on the field.\\nThis field was really important to me as I was going to Accham. I believe I may not be the only person whose brain is wired to think about “Chhaupadi” and “Rara Lake” when we hear Far West.\\nWe were informed that we were not staying in a hotel due to COVID-19 situation and we were about to stay at someone’s house there. The first thing that hit me was how were we going to manage our period and where were we going to dispose of our pads? And if we told the house owner that we were on our periods, were they going to put us in a “Chhau Goth”. What would that be like? All those stories and news of how the girls and women there stayed in a small Chhau hut during their menstruation and all those difficulties they faced and the incidents of abuse, violence and death that occurred inside Chhau hut started to play inside our heads.\\n“Are we really confident in pursuing this project after all?”\\nThe “we” here is me and my friend Shreya. My trip partner.\\n\\nLuckily, we got to stay in a hotel at Sanfebagar, Accham. The COVID threat was slowly dropping down and few hotels were taking guests. We got a nice room for us and no there were no \"Chhau Goth\" around Sanfebagar. It was a long day and we were exhausted. We had our morning tea at Kathmandu, lunch at Dhangadi and dinner at Accham, the same day. The road trip from Dhangadi to Accham was comfortable and a treat to the soul that continuously strives to be closer to nature. Throughout the trip I was in a state of serenity pointing toward everything\\xa0 I found fascinating as if I were a baby. The scenic view of the haystacks all over the lands in Doti, the deep blue rivers, the green farms and everything present at that moment served me as a happy pill. After a period of lockdown inside the house due to COVID, just being there in the presence of nature and good people felt more than special.\\nThe next morning, we went to Sakot, with some local activists. We were going there to conduct a program about “Dignified menstruation and the effect on mental health due to factors related to menstruation.” I was allocated to the resource section of mental health. The road was risky and we were an hour late at reaching the school. A group of young girls and women were waiting for us there already and they greeted us with a big but shy smile on their faces.\\nThe program started and all I was expecting from them was to share about the menstrual taboos they followed and believed, and how they are helplessly giving in to all those menstrual stigmas because we went there all over from Kathmandu to break those taboos and stigmas, didn’t we? But, to my surprise most of the participants shared their stories of how they lied about their periods at home and stayed inside the house instead of Chhau hut to test whether the taboos are real. To test whether or not god punishes them for breaking the taboos.\\nBoooom, this was the first attack on my pre-assumptions about the Far West.\\nI was totally excited to listen to these stories of brave women, young and old, who spoke with their beautiful Acchami accent about how they were fighting the norms of their society and the anger and determination to root out the stigma that was prevalent in their community was radiating through their eyes and their voices. The credit was all to the local activists who worked to break that Chhau hut in their minds unlike the policy makers who are trying to decrease this problem by decreasing the number of physical Chhau goth. These activists have worked to empower these women to advocate what they learned and to fight to gain a position that they deserved at home and in society regardless of whether or not they are on their periods.\\n\\nThe thing that generated passion to work on this issue for me was not the fact that the society forces people to follow “Chhaupadi” in the name of culture but to know more about what makes all of us accept such degrading culture. When do we actually start believing that menstruation actually makes anyone impure? At what age? At which moment we decide to never experiment and explore the truth and accept all the ill treatment we receive based on the biological process?\\nWe heard their stories about how they had to do all the outdoor chores while they were menstruating but were given dry bread for meals and restricted to eat most of the foods and are not allowed to drink milk.\\nRupa Saud, 26, shared, “My in-laws think I am being over-smart by not staying in the Chhau hut. Back at my home in Surkhet I never had to follow Chhaupadi and nothing ever happened before. What’s the point of keeping our gods alive if we ourselves are going to die in a Chhau hut?”\\nSeema Kumari, 20 shared, \"The women here think we are gaining some personal benefits for advocating about this issue. Some of the women here don\\'t wear any kind of pads. We offered to teach them pad-making skills using clothes available at home but they refused and said they will not use any such thing as they have never used anything to manage their periods before and just because you young people went to school doesn’t mean you know everything.”\\nNow, this was the second attack on my pre-assumption. My preconceived notions were challenged one after another and defeated bravely by the girls. I used to think people there were not being able to manage their periods properly and hygienically because they didn\\'t have access to the materials. I used to think that if we would give them access to materials and skills, half the problem about menstrual hygiene would be solved. But, turns out it\\'s just what I “think”.\\n\\nAs Socrates puts it, “I cannot teach anybody anything, I can only make them think.” After listening to these women and girls I felt that they have really started thinking and this thought has led them to take action to test those cultural norms. The reason I ended up there was also because I thought about these issues, I had few unanswered questions I was seeking answers for.\\nLack of resources, information and skills are not the only problems. The mindset established against menstruation is a real problem. Who seeded such a strong fallacy of untouchability toward women on those days of the month? And how did such taboo spread so contagiously among all races, all geographies, and all levels of the people? It is one of many stirring unanswered questions that has been holding the women communities back in many parts of the world. But the positive part is, these questions have started to arise among some people and as long as there are people working to ignite such thoughts more and more, every single person can win and help others win the fight against such taboos on their own.\\nNow, my mind is no more wired to think about Chhaupadi when I hear Far West. All I now think is how many of us are carrying a Chhau goth inside our mind, wherever we go? How do we plan to take ourselves out of that small, narrow and dark Chhau goth?\\n(The author is executive head at SiTL, an NGO working for youths and children)\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThere is a wide diversity of sexual orientations among human beings. Ever since I was a teenager, I was always confused about my orientation. As I never felt sexual attraction toward anyone, I used to consider myself an asexual. When I was 21, I happened to be very close to a gentleman, developed an emotional connection, and was surprisingly attracted to him. It was my one-sided attraction that was never reciprocated and thus never turned into a relationship. But this phase of my life helped me identify myself as a demisexual.\\xa0\\nA demisexual is someone who experiences sexual attraction only after having a strong emotional bond with an individual. After that incident, I could not feel sexually attracted to anyone in my life as I could not develop a strong emotional bond with anyone. Some people with similar orientations feel sexual attraction for only one person in their lives. They never get attracted to other individuals even after being separated from that first person. Other people of demisexual orientation can develop sexual attraction with other individuals if they can develop a strong emotional connection.\\nGrowing up as a demisexual was a slightly different experience for me than that of my conventional heterosexual friends. I was never a part of the groups watching adult movies on weekends in the college hostel. I was never interested in going on romantic dates. I was never fascinated with adult trash talks with my friends. I was more interested in writing poetry, singing, and reading stories. Being a demisexual, I am misunderstood most of the time. The guys whose relationship or marriage proposals I have rejected often call me egoistic, picky, and someone who doesn’t respect their feelings toward me. The truth is that I cannot see them with lustful eyes as I don’t feel any sexual attraction toward them. Being in a relationship without deep friendship, mental connection, and strong emotional bond is no different than a nightmare.\\xa0\\nSome people have mistaken my orientation, assuming that I am a disciplined sexual. What they fail in understanding is the difference between a demisexual and a disciplined sexual person.\\xa0\\nA disciplined sexual can feel sexual attraction to other individuals without emotional bonds but choose not to participate in sexual activities without having an emotional bond first, and they also choose to be loyal with their choice. In the case of a demisexual, the person doesn’t have a sexual attraction in the first place if there is no deep emotional connection involved. They are never attracted to physical beauty, appearance, and aesthetics, and thus love at first sight doesn’t exist in their dictionary.\\nIf anyone is interested in making a demisexual their life partner, then attractive gifts, dinner dates, flirting etc. are not going to help their cause. Such attempts might even be counter-productive as it might intensify the feeling of aversion.\\xa0All they can do is start with friendship and let the demisexual individual explore them. Giving enough time in friendship until their emotional bond and friendship gets stronger is the best thing they can do.\\n(The author is a student of architecture at Kantipur International College)\\n',\n",

She holds in her eyes that which fills women and girls with joy.Every morning after her family members eat and go their ways, she heads out with a basket on her head. The fragility of bangles, mirrors, and colors weighs down upon her head as she walks gracefully (in the past bare footed, now slipper-clad), her spine holding straight, her hips swaying gently. She is draped today in a dirt yellow sari, the sash turned turban-like to help her hold the basket in place. As she heads out to the bazaar, her girls have gone the other way--to study, get an education. One had a slight fever and needed medicine, the other had run out of copybooks for college work. They wondered what goodies they would make for snacks when they came back home after studying and made a fuss about what they saw available in the kitchen. They’ll have chicken tomorrow, it’s Saturday! She reminded them. The Churi Walli smiles as she settles down, placing her ware before her at the street side. Women and girls walking past look down at her basket--the colors, the sparkles take up their eyes and minds. Shovawati, the 55-year-old breadwinner, has kept together her family of 17 selling beauty enhancements. She offers happiness, a sense of self-worth, a daydream out of this world. Shovawati lives in Thulo Ganauria of Suddhodhan Municipality. She was born to parents for whom daughters were a burden. She was born at a time when the society accepted child marriage as a normal and grandparents, matchmakers, and parents made nuptial commitments early on, when girls and boys were still infants. Families at the time were under constant stress regarding the marriage of their daughters. The sooner the knot was tied, the safer their daughter’s future would be and it was not often that the family had a good idea of what their child was getting into physically or mentally. Such was the world Shovawati was born into. “I sell bangles and cosmetic products, things that make women and girls feel good about themselves. I come from a living immersed in traditional values that I sometimes unknowingly try to impose on my daughters. For example, I still think with horror about this marriage I’d arranged for my 17-year-old daughter Sasikala!”“I did not see, I did not see.”  But then she did see! A different world. She became associated with SAHAJ and its mothers’ group. Mentors, peers, counselors talked to her, she talked to them. “I had much to do and earning to feed so many people had drained my energy. I had not taken the time to think!” Women, mothers, sisters, daughters, daughters-in-law, granddaughters: their rights, their health, their education, their financial independence, their wellbeing, their happiness came up in conversations. During one of the get-togethers of the group, a lawyer came to spend time with them and talked to them about the impact of child marriage.  “I was shocked.” Shovawati saw herself and her daughter in a different light. She saw her daughter as a victim and herself as the person hurting her. At 17, her “piece of heart” was still a child, she realized. She saw herself about to put her daughter at high risk to both physical harm and neglect. Early pregnancy would have long-term health effects and she would probably never finish her education, become financially able. The mother and daughter talked, “I'd like to complete my education,” said Sasikala when she learned of the questions SAHAJ had put in her mother’s mind.  “I was so happy to hear her say that,” Shovawati remembers. Her eyes tear up as she thinks of how close her daughter came to a life that she would perhaps never control. “Now, I tell everyone to tell their daughters to study, get a job, learn something that makes them financially able.” Tonight Shovawati will count the money she has earned over the day, she will think how fortunate she wants her daughters to be, how she will take care of them and their future so they can take care of themselves forever.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nCan you point out in a doll where respect lies? Is it stored in specific areas of the doll? Does this apply to all humans?\\nFew months ago, a 19-year old girl was raped by a teacher in Doti. At first, he tried to lure her to have sexual relation with him using various incentives but when she did not give in, the teacher started blackmailing her using pictures of a school picnic.\\nThe teacher repeatedly raped the girl by blackmailing. She even got pregnant and had to get an abortion in Kathmandu. The accused was brought to the court in Doti yet he was bailed.\\nWhile the story is saddening on its own what is even more dangerous is that girls like her do not prioritize their safety first. They feel they have a deep sense of responsibility to protect their respect at all cost.\\nRape victims don’t open up about their abuse for several years due to the fear of being shamed. In addition, blackmail with pictures and videos have been a cause of suicides and rapes and this is where we need to introspect.\\xa0\\nWhat if these girls were taught differently? What if girls were not constantly told that their self-worth is in their body? Perhaps, we could have saved them from being raped, reduced their suffering and even prevented them from taking their own lives.\\xa0\\nKamala Bhasin, an Indian developmental feminist activist, poet, author and founder member of Sangat Organization in an Indian talk-show has said, “If I am raped, people say I lost my honor. How did I lose my honor? Who kept my honor in my vagina? It’s the rapist who loses respect, not the woman who is raped.”\\xa0\\nWe should teach girls that their honor and respect don’t lie inside their bodies or on the body parts as she rightfully mentions. The society widely holds women accountable for their respect, their family’s respect and respect of their whole community.\\xa0\\nHowever, everyone should try to understand that girls and women are not a vacant pot to keep dignity of everyone including themselves nor do they need to carry a mountain of prestige everywhere. In an age where they are sexualized every day, they need to stop believing that their body is a temple of worship.\\nWe need to make it abundantly clear that respect and honor is not tattooed in their skin, muscles and bones. So, if they happen to be sexually violated or blackmailed for their pictures and videos to be leaked on the social media, they will not feel ashamed and consider taking their life.\\nThis way even if girls participate in showing some skin, the society cannot map their character like tanned marks on their skin after exposure to the sunlight.\\nMoreover, the victims would not be blamed for the violence against them pointing at their 'exposed' bodies. Only if they know in their hearts that their pride is intact and it cannot be taken away so easily, they would open up about how they were violated and talk about the perpetrators. They would possibly report crimes more often if they know that they matter more than their image in the public.\\nWe can’t risk any more lives due to embedded societal convictions placed on a girl from a young age. We can’t let them grow up believing that their bodies can be a medium of shame as it easily translates to saying their own bodies can become their enemy.\\xa0\\nIt’s high time that girls unlearn conventional beliefs and relearn necessary values of putting themselves first. They should internalize that they as an individual are inherently valuable and that their safety not their social position is paramount.\\nLooking at the trends of how girls and women are shamed for being raped, sexually harassed and assaulted, this mindset that their private parts are an epitome of respect needs to change.\\nLet’s teach everyone again on respect starting with every girl child.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nLesson 1\\nWe often share jokes about “wives”. The joke could be about how she is \"bossy\" or how she works, her routine, looks, the time she takes to get ready, etc. We laugh and forget all about it.\\nHowever, take a look at what we are actually doing:\\n\\nWe are telling the younger boys on the group that it is okay to “shame” and “demean” women. You might ask how? We are telling them it is okay to call women names and complain about the several things mentioned above. They don’t comprehend these as jokes. We are shaping the young boy to grow up and make jokes about the female figures in his life (could be his mom, partner, aunt, etc.). Are you okay with your little boy doing this?\\nWe are telling the younger girls that it is okay to be treated like this. We are normalizing this situation for her. How? When a girl reads a joke, she automatically associates it to her mom, aunt, any female relative, who she looks up to. And she is picking up that it is okay to be treated like that and being called names. Would you like your daughter to be treated like this by her in-laws? Or even her siblings and other members of the family?\\nWe are teaching both boys and girls that women (youngsters quickly associate the joke with their moms or any relative) are inferior or cunningly evil.\\nSome of those who are aware and feel awful about such jokes remain silent. How is this harmful? You teach your child it is okay to not stand up for women (whether a girl or a boy). You are normalizing the perception that women are inferior.\\n\\nLesson 2\\nAnother sign of misogyny is the words we use to describe the same situation for a male and female.\\n\\nWhile a man is “decisive”, a woman is “bossy”.\\nA man can be “authoritative” and “charismatic”, but a woman is “shrill”.\\nWhen a man is smart and talkative, we say the exact same words, \"smart and talkative\" but for a woman \"kainchi jaisi zubaan.\"\\nA man would be called a leader, but a woman is a \"ballbreaker\".\\nWhen a man pushes his point, he is \"persistent\" while a woman is \"nagging.\"\\nWhy do we describe a man who expresses his emotions as a “little girl”? How is that supposed to be an insult? “Don’t be a girl” is often used to describe men who express emotions.\\n\\nWhy do we use different terminology? How are the two different? Why should we have to use derogatory words for women and positive comments for men?\\nPlease refrain from doing this, whether around your child or not. You are creating a mentally toxic environment for both genders and are degrading women.\\nLesson 3\\nHow would you feel if your child is body/color shaming in public? Not good, embarrassed. You will probably ask yourself; “how did my child learn that?”\\nYou don’t realize that you are the reason.\\n\\nYou share jokes and memes about the appearance of people, and females especially. Such supposed jokes are titled \"Who will marry her?\" or something even more insulting.\\nWhen looking for a \"bahu\", you prioritize fair-skinned and slim girls.\\n\\nWho gave you the right to make comments about anybody’s body? When you do this around your child, s/he thinks it is okay to make such snarky comments. You are also creating an unhealthy environment for a young girl who will have complexes about the way she looks. Do you think it is right? For you, it might be a joke. For someone else, it could be her/ his whole life. Instead of focusing on petty things such as her looks, look into her education, hobbies, career, etc.\\nLesson 4\\nNow reflect upon the upbringing of your children or someone who you have known closely. There is a massive difference between how we bring up a boy and a girl. I will choose just two examples, but I am sure you will have many more to share.\\n\\nCooking- Why are girls told from the very beginning that she must know how to cook? When looking for a “bahu”, knowing how to cook is a prerequisite. However, have you ever encouraged your boy to learn how to cook? Probably not. I am not saying stop encouraging your girls to cook. What I am saying is, start encouraging your boys. Cooking is essential for survival. Stop gender stereotyping the role of a cook. A man should know how to cook and survive through.\\nOffice- Why are young boys asked to start visiting the office at an early age, but girls have to \"prove\" themselves before stepping in? Why do you ask your little boy to accompany his dad while the girl is usually helping her mom with chores? Do you think because women are less competent? Or do you not want your daughter or any female to be independent? Are you scared she will be better? Or are you waiting to get her married off? Why are women looked as somebody’s liabilities all the time? She is never her own person. First, she is her father’s daughter and then her husband’s wife. Where is her own identity?\\n\\nConclusion\\nWhile your joke has no hard intentions, it is doing more damage than one can think of. Now, this\\nis a problem. The anecdote easily converts or influences the mindset of the society (or is rather a result of the mentality of the community). Rape, sexual harassment, domestic abuse, dowry deaths and other crimes against women are a result of this inferior thought process toward women.\\nThe above issues are a classic example of misogyny. Misogyny in the 21st century is turning into messages and jokes. Women are easily and more often than not accused by the \\'peacemakers\\' when she complains about abuse at home. She is expected to \"accept\" her life. We quickly question her character, level of patience, what she is doing to serve her husband, etc., even when the actual issue may be about the misdeeds on the part of the man/husband.\\nInstead of demeaning women, it would be better to share jokes, articles, posts which are more respectful toward women. This will help nurture the future generations and accept women for who they are. It will create a better, ethical and equitable attitude in life. Men should learn that women are people who deserve respect and dignity—their opinion, decisions, complaints and consent matter. This change will only materialize when we begin changing our lifestyle and upbringing.\\nI hope by now, you have pretty much understood what I am trying to explain. Reflect on your behavior and stop discrimination. A light joke and remark can shape a child\\'s future, and the circle of patriarchy will be never-ending. Ask yourself how you want the generations to come to treat the female figures in his/her life. And women, start standing up for yourselves. You might be financially dependent on your husband, but do you want the same dependence for your daughter? Also, never be afraid to ask for being treated right. Your reliance on your husband doesn\\'t allow him to demean and insult you. His entire household depends on you. Never forget that.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWhenever I read about rapes, there is this wrenching pain in my heart with twisting and twirling of my abdomen, tears all over my eyes and my body totally numb. I take every rape related news very personally not because I have had a similar experience in life but because I think if someone decides to rape me I\\'ll be raped. I am scared that I might be just another story someday. While sharing these infuriating thoughts with one of my closest friends he scoffed and asked me \"You need to stop viewing world with the lens of feminism. You are not a victim, your ranting isn\\'t changing anything. Tell me what you can do?\"\\nIf I have to rant, I might rant on how unfair it is for us to feel threatened just to get out of our house not only at night but also in broad daylight. I would rant about how my choice of clothes determines my character. Meanwhile, I see men in shorts and sleeveless T-shirts and yet don\\'t get aroused or tempted by their skin. That\\'s probably because men do not have shiny and hairless skin like us? Or maybe because I have basic respect for another human\\'s\\xa0 body, and choices. I would rant about how men shift their gaze from my eyes to my neck and fixate them over my chest while we share our thoughts. I would rant about all those times when I was groped publicly and asked to not get into public bus if my body is that fragile when I raised my voice. I would rant about my senior who mistook me drinking with him as a signal. But I don\\'t rant about these. My expectations from men have fallen so low that I have accepted \"men will be men\\'. So, whenever I meet a guy who treats women like human instead of an object I automatically think him to be the best man possible but all he is doing is behaving as human as possible.\\nWhat can I do? I cannot complain and not find a solution, can I?\\nFirst and foremost what is our source of knowledge about sex? Is it from the curriculum books or from packages we get over the internet? How many of us were taught reproductive health chapters in our biology classes without hesitation? I remember my science teacher skipping that chapter like it doesn\\'t exist. Are we open about sex and intimacy with people who are younger than us? Are parents considering sitting with their younger ones and having the tough, uncomfortable talk? How exactly are teens being educated about sex?\\xa0 Sex education is one of the most important factors here which not only educates the younger ones but also resolves their curious queries. In age of experiments and curiosity, we see our youngsters tempting over anything that\\'s reckless. While teaching about sex and human anatomy, one should be taught that sex happens between two and it is basic need for human irrespective of any sex. Teaching minors about touch and how to differentiate between the good touch and the bad touch is very essential. Certain areas of body which are private and no one should have an acess to them.\\nWe as a society, a patriarchial society, hold our daughters with rules and regulations, and invest pride, dignity of her, her family and society over the organ between her legs. How and why is it fair that the organ that enables a woman to push a new life out of her also makes her the most vulnerable? Is being a woman and having the organ and being blessed with the ability to conceive and give birth not a power of strength? But why does the same organ make her vulnerable and signifies her character? Being raped isn\\'t her choice but raping is his choice. So why do we always accuse the victim and leave the rapist off the hook? When will we stop to put the character, dignity and pride of whole family on the fragile shoulders of our daughters? Should we not hold our son responsible instead of condoning him? We need to teach our daughters and sisters that they can go out and conquer the world and we will stick for each other no matter what. We need to teach our sons and brothers that women are not for objectification and treat them as human as possiblle\\nRape happens between closed doors, mostly from people we have known or our confidants. Rapists do not have some different identity. They live among us and may be our father, uncle, brother, brother-in-law, or cousin. The rapist usually rapes because he is confident enough that the crime is usually brushed under the carpet: like nothing happened and nothing has changed. We put so much of pride over the fragile organ between our legs that most of the times the victim never opens up. The audacity of rapists increases with the practice of victim-blaming, witch-hunting and blaming the clothes.\\nWhatever I drape myself in, I know if someone decides to rape, I\\'ll be raped. It\\'s not my cloth. My cloth was never an issue. It\\'s society we live in that gives women a position of goddess yet treat her on the basis of the organ. It\\'s not our organ that makes us vulnerable. It\\'s the people shaped by patriarchy that makes us vulnerable. Will society digest if I decide to lead a happy life forgetting the wounds of past? Imagine not putting the entire dignity and pride over an organ, and punishing the victim, giving women equal rights and freedom. Can you imagine a better world? Can you imagine the world where women decide her worth and not her vagina?\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNepal Sambat is one of the national calendars of Nepal traditionally associated with the Newa community and the Kathmandu Valley. It has, for the past 1,140 years, been a lunar-based calendar but recently, efforts have been made to introduce a solar calendar to bring uniformity and regularity. This year, a solar calendar was devised and released by activists which has come into effect from October 20. But, perhaps, it was a solution to an issue that nobody thought was a problem.\\nNepal Sambat has been following its lunar roots for a long time and all the celebrations of festivals have followed the same calendar system ever since their inception. This means that Nepal Sambat (NS) calendar follows the phases of the moon as a basis of determining the date. This is also popularly known as ‘panchanga’ or ‘tithi’ system. Unlike the solar calendars, lunar calendars have been found to be very irregular, the cause of which may be because they do not follow the leap day system and instead rely on a leap-month system. Since NS is based on this system, the New Year’s Day for it (Nhu dan) has been usually celebrated on the day of ‘Mha Puja’ in the Newa community. This has always been a problem for many people who want to tie some event to a certain NS date, but since it keeps fluctuating, it can be highly unreliable for official usage.\\nA solution to this problem has recently been proposed by a few enthusiasts, which involves the adoption of the solar calendar system instead of the lunar counterpart, so that the dates become more regular. This may be seen as a great solution for the particular problem but it might in fact come as a potential problem for the Newa community that relies on the lunar calendar system to follow certain festivals. October 20 has been marked as the New Year’s Day for NS 1140, which creates a plethora of problems and disputes related to when these festivals should be celebrated.\\nTaking a look at how the lunar calendar system came to be the official calendar for celebrating most Newa festivals, it seems that it is the calendar system which is most in line with the seasons. This might have become so as a result of the agricultural past of the Newa community. In the past, the Newa community was a self-sustaining one where people were given different occupations based on their skills, which was passed down for generations. This also included agriculture and farming as a profession. Nepal experiences four major seasons, which made it a necessity for the farmers to majorly cultivate and produce seasonal crops. This is why it is no surprise that a few crops and dishes are prepared and consumed only on particular occasions and seasons; when the crops would have been harvested. For example, ‘quati’ is a soup which consists of nine beans and lentils, is highly nutritious and helps in boosting the immune system of the human body. This is only prepared on ‘Gum Punhi’/’Janai Purnima’ by the Newa community, which is exactly when these beans and lentils would have been harvested and produced in the past.\\xa0\\nIn today’s modern world, people no longer need to wait for a certain occasion because of the boom of trade and there is no necessity for a self-sustaining community. However, if we look at the NS calendar predicted by the astrologers, they are still seen to be more in line with the seasons than the solar calendars, despite the effects of climate change and global warming. This knowledge of the lunar calendar is what our ancestors had left us with, and is what we base our festivals on. Changing this to a solar calendar may not be accepted by the general population because it cannot incorporate such events. A solution for this may be to incorporate the NS dates on the basis of the solar calendar but celebrate the festivals based on the lunar calendar. This seems to be the most viable solution for this problem.\\nHowever, Nepal already has its own luni-solar calendar, Bikram Sambat. Having to juggle between the Gregorian solar calendar and the Bikram Sambat alongside the lunar Nepal Sambat sounds complicated enough, so why would the general public want to adapt to the solar NS anyway? It brings nothing new to the table for the common man except additional unnecessary confusion. The step taken to establish NS as a mainstream official calendar is a welcome one, but to the eye of a common person, it may look like the solution to a problem that never existed and one that creates more confusion. To the person, it looks like a plot to rob him/her of his/her culture by making an unauthentic version of NS, official in the name of conservation of cultural heritage.\\xa0\\nThere have always been people who have asked to make the NS the mainstream calendar for official use because other calendars do not incorporate all the festivals and occasions, but removing the festival element just to incorporate it as mainstream seems like an unwanted solution that defeats the original purpose. It may not be the most practical thing to implement NS as a mainstream calendar because it is very irregular. However, its original lunar version can be made the official calendar for festivals as a way to make it mainstream and as a step to conserve the culture that has been passed down by our ancestors. It makes more sense to do this as Bikram Sambat also has a lunar aspect already associated with it.\\nTaking all of the information into account, many people may not accept the solar NS calendar even if it gets the official green flag. This may create a dispute in the near future among the people in our Newa community which is the exact opposite of the original purpose of establishing a solar NS. The Newa community today seems to be very confused and hence divided when it comes to conserving the culture that has been passed down as some of it may not be largely practical in the modern world. The best way to move forward seems to be to compromise among the old values and replacing impractical ones with new values, but for most people from the older generation, change is not very acceptable and hence results in a divide in the mostly unified Newa community. This is the reason solar NS might be unacceptable for many Newa people.\\n(Tuladhar is a data science student at Asian Institute of Technology, Thailand)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDespite all the odds and uncertainties, a part of the national education system, the one run by private schools, has been able to operate for a large part of the pandemic while the vast majority of public schools have struggled since the beginning.\\nWith infections rising throughout the country, it’s not easy to forecast an “end of the tunnel” but very probably it will take at least six more months to have widely available vaccines.\\nThe second wave in Europe is certainly not encouraging and only very strong protocols, hardly implementable at massive scales in a country like Nepal, can be effective in controlling the spread of the virus while managing to have a semi-normal life that also includes classroom based learning.\\nWhat will be the future of the education sector in Nepal in six months from now?\\nMany questions remain unanswered but all go down to make some difficult calls.\\nWill online education be the only doable way of imparting education or will other options be available, allowing also a scaled back return to classroom-based learning?\\nWhat about the situation of community-managed schools that have, on average, considerably inferior infrastructure than their private counterparts and whose students come from less affluent families unable to provide the indispensible tools for online learning?\\nIn case of a limited return to classroom, which procedures will be in place to ensure the safety of our students, teachers, and staff?\\nConsidering the risks, will teachers be ready to choose between their health and livelihood?\\nLast but not least, what did we learn in the last six months?\\nThere are many discussions happening as to how the schools should operate and how new safety and preventive measures will have to be enforced, and their impact on the learning process.\\nUNICEF is working together with governments and schools to keep children learning, and not just reopen schools but make sure schools reopen in a better way.\\nThe federal government and the provincial counterparts have been hard-pressed to ensure that all schools, not only the privately run, are able to continue in their mission of educating the children of the nation.\\xa0\\nHere are a few key suggestions to slowly open school nationally in a phase wise manner:\\nFirst of all for those able to do so, online learning might be the only option available.\\nThis will require fully understanding the working conditions of teachers that were overwhelmed by the very unique circumstances of finding themselves at home while teaching.\\nThe situation was even more demanding for female teachers who have to complete all the household duties, look after the children, cater to the in-laws and sit down with a smile for the online classes.\\nThe truth is that the society we live in is still very unfair to women and too many expectations are tossed at them. Female teachers should be admired and recognized for bravely coping professionally and responsibly with all the responsibilities imposed on them.\\nTherefore for those schools able to run online classrooms, some sort of guaranteed balancing acts should be ensured so that teachers won’t feel overwhelmed and lonely again.\\nOn the other hand, we doubt the government will be able to provide massive numbers of computers, indispensible for online classes, to less affluent families that happen to enroll their children in community schools.\\nIn such circumstances, we might have to think creatively with limited in-person classroom hours, mixing them with alternative forms of studying.\\nWherever possible, junior school should avail of non-traditional, outside classroom learning and could come to schools only on weekends with their parents.\\nOther students could come alternately for only three days a week to school and this is aligned with the overall efforts of the government to minimize the working days from the normal 190 teaching days to whatever remaining days are available.\\nTo offset the reduction in in-person teaching, local youths, after receiving appropriate trainings, could be mobilized as they can volunteer and run support classes in smaller groups either by visiting children in their homes or by arranging “one-stop temporary learning” outposts in the communities.\\nHarnessing on the power of youth clubs, for example, can really help teachers, especially those from community schools, to better provide meaningful learning outcomes as their duties will be shared with others.\\nFor all schools running their own transportation services and willing to experiment a mix of in-person and online learning, special provisions should be applied, not only through continuous and exhaustive disinfection\\xa0 of the vehicles but also in terms of seating arrangements with adequate distances.\\nThis means that a less number of children will be able to travel on the same vehicle.\\nYet, with students attending classroom not as regularly as before, any concerns in terms of more pollution and traffic havoc being created by more buses’ runs, will be offset because of less students being in the school premises at the same time.\\nWhenever students will access to face-to-face classrooms, special provisions must be put in place.\\nMask must be made compulsory for all stakeholders in school and temperature check must be made mandatory for students together with hand sanitizers points at school entry and strong protocols for monitored hand-washing at regular time intervals.\\nThis aspect of basic sanitation, often a weak point in many community schools, must be fixed and it is fair to demand local governments across the country to ensure reliable water supplies for all these schools.\\nIn addition, the number of students in the classrooms should be drastically reduced as the average of over 30 students for one classroom constitutes a serious health hazard.\\nIn certain circumstances, face-to-face classes should be allowed only for the senior school maintaining physical distancing as they would be careful and responsible with themselves and their peers.\\nIt will be hard to make prioritizations on who will have more access to in-person learning but common sense and practical considerations should guide the stakeholders in their decision making.\\nSo despite all these odds, the “Learning Show” has to go on and we better be prepared.\\nTeachers should be considered, to some extent, as equals to many other essential workers providing indispensible services nowadays.\\nThough they did not take a Hippocratic oath, their contributions during these trying times have been invaluable and deserves recognition.\\nWe are aware that the solutions proposed here have their own shortcomings and won’t fully address all the concerns from the stakeholders.\\nWe need to make sure that not only students enrolled in private education institutions are able to enjoy their rights to learning but also try our best to come up with innovative solutions that will allow the highest number of students, especially those from community schools, to fulfill their rights safely too.\\nWill everything work out perfectly?\\nWill stakeholders be willing to make some trade-offs in the process?\\nGenuine goodwill and determination will only help answer these questions and unlock the difficult conundrum on how to ensure learning of the future generations won’t be any more hampered by a virus.\\n\\xa0\\n(Chandrayan P.

       "  \"\\nAfter a\\xa0 normal day in my residential school, I finished my classes for the day and was returning back to my residence. I came to my room, changed and opened my laptop to check the email. To my astonishment, my sister had emailed me a link and a text that read “ You need to get into this Program. Good luck”. I read every testimony from Yale Young Global Scholars (YYGS) alumni on the internet and told myself I could not miss out on this opportunity. I was initially very diffident about this program since some of the testimonials said that it’s a very selective program and required a very promising academic background. I had an average grade and moreover wasn’t confident and so I called it off instantly. A week later I logged into the portal and there was the application. And from that point, my YYGS journey started.\\nYYGS is a two-week academic enrichment program for outstanding high school students from around the world. YYGS empowers the global community of leaders by providing a platform to learn and build a community that fosters intellectual curiosity, deepens understanding, and inspires creative action across all borders. YYGS is renowned for its diverse and inclusive community with students coming from 130 countries (including all 50 U.S. states) and commitment to increasing education access. Founded back in 2001, it initially started with two sessions with 300 students to now having almost twelve sessions with 2,400 students.\\nThe application process was pretty long. We had to answer several prompts. It also required our high school transcript and two letters of recommendations. I still remember how nervous I was on the day of the deadline. I checked each and every word carefully trying to avoid typos. I double-checked all the documents I had to attach. After a few seconds, I took a long breath and clicked submit. We had a couple of months before we got our decisions and I was very anxious.\\nOn March 13th we got our decisions. As soon as I saw the email that read “ application update”, I hurried and opened the portal. I still remember the Y-letter confetti showered my desktop as I wiped my happy tears. I was thrilled and hugged my parents real tight. It was a dream come true. I was going to Yale this summer. I was four months away from living my dream. I was so excited about my visa, travelling to the USA for the first time, visiting Yale University, making friends and many more.\\nHowever, in March COVID-19 devastated the USA. Heartbreaking news from New York started pouring in and I realized this was beyond my control. All our hopes were dashed. YYGS administrators were very hopeful even when New York was ground zero for COVID-19. Deep inside I had a bit of hope. I genuinely thought things would get better by July. But after March, the United States halted international flights and the US Consulate in Kathmandu stopped issuing visas. Soon, things got ugly in Kathmandu and we were in lockdown too. By mid-April, YYGS released their decision of cancelling YYGS’20.\\nFor a second I thought all my hard work went in vain. But fortunately, those of us who could defer were deferred to YYGS’21 and YYGS students who were identified as high school juniors were given an option to request a spot in their new pilot online program - “YYGS Connect”\\nI was eligible for YYGS Connect, but I was having second thoughts. I had never attended an online class. Given the infrastructure in my country, it was challenging to attend an online class as we do not have a reliable power supply and internet connection.\\nAlso, I was concerned about missing the social aspect of the program. I told myself, this would only give me screen fatigue and nothing else. I told my elder sister all my thoughts and she got so furious. She told me how I was lucky enough to be selected for YYGS Connect. She told me that the choice was mine, but I had to make the right decision. Later, after she put some sense in my head I accepted the offer and made the best of my life.\\nI attended the “Solving Global Challenges Session III” seminar. We had two sessions. The first one was “The Unfair Race” by Emilie Kilfoil. This seminar explored the cycle of poverty and why breaking it is so complex. We discussed how families trapped in the cycle of poverty have either limited or no resources. We also came to the conclusion that affirmative action at some point is very important and justifiable. We listened to American philosopher, Judith Jarvis Thomson and Robert Nozick and their stands on positive discrimination. Our instructor then gave us prompts and made us discuss each one in the breakout rooms. We had a very intense discussion. I was so surprised by the diversity of the opinions that came up during the discussion. We had group presentations and our instructor gave us feedback. This session helped me explore new ideas. In Nepal, we are always told to work hard to get out of the cycle of poverty. After this session, I have a counter-argument for people who hold on to this thought. One can’t get out of the cycle of poverty simply because of hard work. Our society and system are rigged; it works against the poor and is made to favor the rich. So unless we make some systemic changes. Hard work alone won't break the cycle of poverty.\\nThe second session was “The Water War” by Nora Massie.\\xa0 In this session, we discussed Tony Allan’s idea of Virtual Water. There are around 250 rivers in the world that run through two or more countries and interstates which could cause regional conflict. Water issues could also exacerbate political issues. We also concluded that water can be a bridge to peace in the warring countries. We examined the graphs and calculated the water potential of each country.\\nOther than the seminars, we also got the opportunity to virtually attend the lectures from professors across Yale University. We also had a question/answer session with them. We discussed how in today’s world, industries use and discard enormous amounts of toxic materials, water and energy in the environment. I had never thought about the resources required for a simple object I use in my daily life.\\n\\xa0In a lecture, we listened and discussed the testimonies of the soldiers who rescued the Jews from the concentration camps during the World War II. Each and every discussion in the breakout rooms were so meaningful and had a profound effect on me. Simulations gave us the strength to deal with the on-going pandemic and ways we could be useful in our community during these difficult times.\\nYYGS has been a very wholesome experience for me. YYGS\\xa0 gave me a new perspective to perceive the world. I learned the value of diversity and heard from students from 130 countries. Even though we had diverse opinions, I was able to respect peer opinions and they valued my perspective too. This has piqued my intellectual curiosity and deepened my understanding of world issues.\\nGiven my background, my journey to YYGS speaks volume about the inclusive and holistic selection process of YYGS.\\xa0 I hope my experience motivates others to apply to this program. Applications for YYGS’21 is already out now. I would like to encourage every high school student to apply to this program.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nFinland joined the NATO military alliance Tuesday, dealing a major blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin with a historic realignment of Europe’s post-Cold War security landscape triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe Nordic country’s membership doubles Russia’s border with the world’s biggest security alliance. Finland had adopted neutrality after its defeat by the Soviets in World War II, but its leaders signaled they wanted to join NATO after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine sent a shiver of fear through its neighbors.\\n“The era of nonalignment in our history has come to an end -– a new era begins,” President Sauli Niinistö said before his country’s blue-and-white flag was raised outside NATO headquarters. A short distance away, outside the security fence, a few dozen people wrapped in flags of their own chanted, “Ukraine needs NATO.”\\nIn praising Finland’s membership, U.S. President Joe Biden noted it came on the 74th anniversary of the signing of NATO’s founding treaty on April 4, 1949.\\n“When Putin launched his brutal war of aggression against the people of Ukraine, he thought he could divide Europe and NATO. He was wrong,” Biden said in a statement. “Today, we are more united than ever. And together — strengthened by our newest ally, Finland — we will continue to preserve transatlantic security, defend every inch of NATO territory, and meet any and all challenges we face.”\\nThe move is a strategic and political setback for Putin, who has long complained about NATO’s expansion toward Russia and partly used that as a justification for the invasion.\\n“I’m tempted to say this is maybe the one thing that we can thank Mr. Putin for because he once again here precipitated something he claims to want to prevent by Russia’s aggression, causing many countries to believe that they have to do more to look out for their own defense and to make sure that they can deter possible Russian aggression going forward,” U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said before accepting the documents that made Finland’s membership official.\\nThe U.S. State Department is the repository of NATO texts concerning membership.\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sent his congratulations to Finland, writing on Telegram that “amid Russian aggression, the Alliance became the only effective guarantee of security in the region.”\\nRussia warned it would be forced to take “retaliatory measures” to address what it called security threats created by Finland’s membership. It had also warned it would bolster forces near Finland if NATO sends any additional troops or equipment to what is its 31st member country.\\nThe alliance says it poses no threat to Moscow.\\nAlarmed by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland, which shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 mile) border with Russia, applied to join in May, seeking protection under the organization’s security umbrella.\\n“Russia tried to create a sphere around them and, well, we are not a sphere. I’m sure that Finns themselves feel more secure, that we are living in a more stable world,” Niinisto said.\\nNeighboring Sweden, which has avoided military alliances for more than 200 years, has also applied. But objections from NATO members Turkey and Hungary have delayed the process.\\nNiinisto said Finland’s membership “is not complete without that of Sweden. The persistent efforts for a rapid Swedish membership continue.“ Finland even gave its ratification of Sweden’s application to Blinken as it joined.\\nIn Stockholm, Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson congratulated Finland and said he believed it would improve Sweden’s security but added that “it’s no secret that we would like to have concluded it hand-in-hand.”\\nEarlier, Russia’s Foreign Ministry said Moscow “will be forced to take military-technical and other retaliatory measures to counter the threats to our national security arising from Finland’s accession to NATO.”\\nIt said Finland’s move marks “a fundamental change in the situation in Northern Europe, which had previously been one of the most stable regions in the world.”\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Finland’s membership reflects the alliance’s anti-Russian course and warned that Moscow will respond depending on what weapons NATO allies place there. But he also sought to play down the impact, noting that Russia has no territorial disputes with Finland.\\nIt’s not clear what additional military resources Russia could send to the Finnish border. Moscow has deployed the bulk of its most capable military units to Ukraine.\\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said no more troops would be sent to Finland unless it asked for help.\\nThe country is now protected by what Stoltenberg called NATO’s “iron-clad security guarantee,” under which all member countries vow to come to the defense of any ally that comes under attack.\\nBut Stoltenberg refused to rule out the possibility of holding more military exercises there and said that NATO would not allow Russia’s demands to dictate the organization’s decisions.\\n“We are constantly assessing our posture, our presence. We have more exercises, we have more presence, also in the Nordic area,” he said.\\nIn 1939 and 1940, Finland’s tiny, ill-equipped forces fought in what became known as the Winter War against the Soviet Union. Over an exceptionally cold winter, Finnish fighters, sometimes cloaked in white bedsheets for camouflage and typically moving unseen on foot, snowshoes and skis, lost some territory to Moscow but forced out the invaders.\\nFinland says it can muster a 280,000-strong fighting force, built on near-universal male conscription and a large, well-trained reserve, equipped with modern artillery, warplanes and tanks. The country of 5.5 million joined the European Union in 1995,\\nFinland’s Parliament, meanwhile, said its website was hit with a so-called denial-of-service attack, which made the site hard to use, with many pages not loading and some functions not available.\\nA pro-Russian hacker group known as NoName057 (16) claimed responsibility, saying the attack was retaliation for Finland joining NATO. The claim could not be immediately verified.\\nThe hacker group, which has reportedly acted on Moscow’s orders, has taken part in a slew of cyberattacks on the U.S. and its allies in the past. Finnish public broadcaster YLE said the same group hit the Parliament’s site last year.\\n',\n",

It had already warned that it would bolster defenses along its border with NATO if the alliance deploys any additional troops or equipment to its new member.\\n“There will be no NATO troops in Finland without the consent of Finland,” NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at the alliance’s headquarters in Brussels a few hours before the country joins.\\nBut he refused to rule out the possibility of holding more military exercises there and said that NATO would not allow Russia’s demands to dictate the organization’s decisions.\\n“We are constantly assessing our posture, our presence. We have more exercises, we have more presence, also in the Nordic area,” he said.\\nLater Tuesday, Finland is set to officially become the 31st member of NATO and take its place among the ranks of the world’s biggest security alliance.\\nAlarmed by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last year, Finland applied to join in May, setting aside years of military non-alignment to seek protection under the organization’s security umbrella. Neighboring Sweden also applied, but its accession process may take a few months longer.\\nFinland shares a 1,340 kilometer (832 mile) border with Russia, so its entry will more than double the size of NATO’s border with Russia. The move is a strategic and political blow to President Vladimir Putin, who has long complained about NATO’s expansion toward Russia — though the alliance says it poses no threat to Moscow.\\n“The Russian Federation will be forced to take military-technical and other retaliatory measures to counter the threats to our national security arising from Finland’s accession to NATO,” the Foreign Ministry warned in a statement.\\nIt said Finland’s move marks “a fundamental change in the situation in Northern Europe, which had previously been one of the most stable regions in the world.”\\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Tuesday that Finland’s membership reflects the alliance’s anti-Russian course and warned that Moscow will respond depending on what weapons NATO allies place there.\\nBut Peskov also sought to play down the impact, noting that Russia has no territorial disputes with Finland.\\nIt’s not clear what additional military resources Russia could send to the Finnish border. Moscow has deployed the bulk of its most capable military units to Ukraine.\\nStoltenberg said that once it joins, Finland will benefit from NATO’s “iron-clad security guarantee,” under which all member countries vow to come to the defense of any ally that comes under attack.\\n“By (Finland) become a full-fledged member, we are removing the room for miscalculation in Moscow about NATO’s readiness to protect Finland, and that makes Finland safer and stronger, and all of us safer,” Stoltenberg said.\\nFinland’s entry, to be marked with a flag-raising ceremony at NATO headquarters, falls on the organization’s very own birthday, the 74th anniversary of the signing of its founding Washington Treaty on April 4, 1949. It also coincides with a meeting of the alliance’s foreign ministers.\\nFinland’s president, foreign and defense ministers will take part in the ceremony.\\nTurkey became the last NATO member country to ratify Finland’s membership protocol on Thursday. It will hand over the document officially enshrining that decision to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken before the ceremony.\\nFinland’s membership becomes official when its own foreign minister hands over documents completing its accession process to Blinken.

       "  '\\nElon Musk had promised to take away all of Twitter’s blue check marks doled out to Hollywood stars, professional athletes, business leaders, authors and journalists unless they start buying a monthly subscription to the social media service.\\nMusk’s goal was to shove the advertising-dependent platform he bought for $44 billion last year into a pay-to-play model — and maybe antagonize some enemies and fellow elites in the process.\\nBut the Saturday deadline passed and the blue checks are still there, many with a new disclaimer explaining they might have been paid for or they might not have been paid for — nobody but Twitter really knows. The company didn’t return a request to clarify its changing policies Monday.\\nDOES A BLUE CHECK MATTER?\\nMatt Darling has been on Twitter for about 15 years and never cared about not having a blue check, though he’d get a kick out of whenever a verified account of “some real-world importance” started following him.\\n“People on Twitter will joke about blue checks like they’re the aristocracy but I don’t think anyone actually thought that,” except for Musk, Darling said.\\nNow, Darling finally got a blue check after paying $11 last month to try out some of the features that come with a Twitter Blue subscription. But seeing it becoming more of a “scarlet letter” under Musk than a symbol of credibility, he used a technique to scrub the blue tick from his profile.\\n“Now it’s a signal of you’re a person who’s not making good tweets so you have to pay for engagement,” said Darling, an economist at the center-right Niskanen Center.\\nMusk has said that starting April 15, only verified accounts will appear in Twitter’s For You feed that recommends what tweets people see. Darling is planning to drop the subscription — it had too many glitches, and he’s not looking for more online clout.\\n“I don’t want Twitter to be pay-for-play. I want it to be a place where people writing interesting tweets are getting the engagement,” he said.\\nHYBRID MODEL\\nInstead of taking away the blue check marks, Twitter on Sunday began appending a new message to profiles: “This account is verified because it’s subscribed to Twitter blue or is a legacy verified account.”\\nIn other words, singer Dionne Warwick and other high-profile verified users still have their blue checks. But so does anyone who pays between $8 and $11 a month for a Twitter Blue subscription — and there’s no way to tell the difference. (Warwick, for her part, made clear she won’t be paying for a blue check because that money will “be going towards my extra hot lattes.”)\\nThat hybrid solution was good enough for Star Trek actor William Shatner, who earlier balked at signing up for a subscription but on Sunday tweeted to Musk: “I can live with this. This is a good compromise”. But it’s not clear if it is a temporary or permanent measure.\\nTHE EXCEPTION\\nTwitter did take away at least one verified check over the weekend: from the main account of the New York Times. The account, which has 55 million followers, had previously been marked with a gold-colored check for verified organizations.\\nBut a user pointed out to Musk over the weekend that the newspaper had said publicly it wouldn’t be paying a monthly fee for check-mark status, so Musk said he would remove the mark and also disparaged the newspaper’s reporting.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAn extraordinary moment in U.S. history is scheduled to unfold in a Manhattan courthouse Tuesday: Former US President Donald Trump, who faces multiple election-related investigations, will surrender to face criminal charges stemming from 2016 hush money payments.\\nThe booking and arraignment are likely to be relatively brief — though hardly routine — as Trump is fingerprinted, learns the exact charges against him and pleads, as expected, not guilty.\\nTrump, who was impeached twice by the U.S. House but was never convicted in the U.S. Senate, will become the first former president to face criminal charges. The nation’s 45th commander in chief will be escorted from Trump Tower to the courthouse by the Secret Service and may have his mug shot taken.\\nNew York police are braced for protests by Trump supporters, who share the former president’s belief that the New York grand jury indictment — and three additional pending investigations — are politically motivated and intended to weaken his bid to retake the White House in 2024.\\nTrump, a former reality-TV star, has been hyping that narrative to his political advantage, raising millions of dollars since the indictment on claims of a “witch hunt.” He has personally assailed the Manhattan district attorney, egged on supporters to protest, and claimed without evidence that the judge presiding over the case “hates me” — something Trump’s own lawyer has said is not true.\\nTrump is scheduled to return to his Florida home, Mar-a-Lago, Tuesday evening to hold a rally, punctuating his new reality: submitting to the dour demands of the American criminal justice system while projecting an aura of defiance and victimhood at celebratory campaign events.\\nA conviction would not prevent Trump from running for or winning the presidency in 2024.\\nInside the Manhattan courtroom, prosecutors led by New York’s district attorney, Alvin Bragg, are expected to unseal the indictment issued last week by a grand jury. This is when Trump and his defense lawyers will get their first glimpse of the precise allegations against him.\\nThe indictment includes multiple charges of falsifying business records, including at least one felony offense, two people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press last week.\\nAfter the arraignment, Trump is expected to be released by authorities because the charges against him don’t require that bail be set.\\nThe investigation is scrutinizing six-figure payments made to porn actor Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal. Both say they had sexual encounters with the married Trump years before he got into politics. Trump denies having sexual liaisons with either woman and has denied any wrongdoing involving payments.\\nThe arraignment will unfold against the backdrop of heavy security in New York, coming more than two years after Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed bid to halt the congressional certification of President Joe Biden’s win.\\nThough police said they had no intelligence suggesting any violence was likely, they were on high alert for any potential disruptions.\\n“While there may be some rabble rousers thinking of coming to our city tomorrow, our message is clear and simple: Control yourselves,” Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference Monday.\\nTrump pollster John McLaughlin said the former president would approach the day with “dignity.”\\n“He will be a gentleman,” McLaughlin said. “He’ll show strength and he’ll show dignity and ... we’ll get through this and win the election.”\\nThe public fascination with the case was evident Monday as national television carried live images of Trump’s motorcade from his Mar-a-Lago club to his red, white and blue Boeing 757. From there, he was flown to New York, where he was expected to spend the night at Trump Tower before turning himself in the following day.\\nThe former president and his aides are embracing the media circus. After initially being caught off guard when news of the indictment broke Thursday evening, Trump and his team are hoping to use the case to his advantage. Still, they asked the judge in a Monday filing to ban photo and video coverage of the arraignment.\\nThough prosecutors routinely insist that no person is above the law, bringing criminal charges against a former president carries instant logistical complications.\\nNew York’s ability to carry out safe and drama-free courthouse proceedings in a case involving a polarizing ex-president could be an important test case as prosecutors in Atlanta and Washington conduct their own investigations of Trump that could also result in charges. Those investigations concern efforts to undo the 2020 election results as well as the possible mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago.\\nTop Republicans, including some of Trump’s potential rivals in next year’s GOP presidential primary, have decried the case against him. President Joe Biden, who has yet to formally announce that he’s seeking reelection next year, and other leading Democrats have largely had little to say about it.\\nTrump’s former U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley, was campaigning on Monday near the U.S.-Mexico border as part of her presidential bid and suggested that coverage of the former president’s indictment was distracting from other key issues, like immigration. But even she added, “You’ve got a liberal prosecutor that’s doing political revenge against a former president.”\\nProsecutors say their case against Trump has nothing to do with politics.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIn the years since Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman catapulted to power, it has been hard to find a controversy in the Middle East that doesn’t somehow involve the 37-year-old heir to the throne. Now he’s pivoting to his next audacious plan: Giving peace a chance.\\nThe moves toward reaching a détente with Iran, reestablishing ties to Syria and ending the kingdom’s yearslong war in Yemen could extricate Prince Mohammed from some of the thorniest regional issues he faces.\\nWhether it succeeds will have profound impacts on the wider Middle East and on his expansive plans to reshape the kingdom away from oil and further into his image. Failure threatens not only his impending rule over a nation crucial to global energy supplies, but a wider region shaken by years of tensions, inflamed in part by his decisions.\\nPrince Mohammed’s rise accelerated in 2015 after his father, King Salman, appointed him as deputy crown prince. That year saw Mohammed, also the country’s defense minister at the time, plunge Saudi Arabia into a military campaign in Yemen, a civil war that grew into a regional proxy battle still continuing today. Riyadh supports Yemen’s exiled government against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels who hold Sanaa, the country’s capital.\\nThe tensions with Iran, at the time still in a nuclear deal with world powers, escalated with Saudi Arabia’s execution of a prominent Shiite cleric in 2016. Protesters stormed Saudi diplomatic posts in Iran, and Riyadh broke off ties to Tehran.\\nIn 2017, Saudi Arabia joined three other Arab nations in boycotting Qatar, which maintains ties to Iran. The same year, the prince made what appeared to be a heavy-handed attempt to break Iranian-backed Hezbollah’s domination of Lebanon’s government by inviting Lebanon’s prime minister to the kingdom and then allegedly forcing him to announce his resignation. The attempt failed and Saudi Arabia’s influence in Lebanon has been diminished ever since.\\nPrince Mohammed days later launched a purported anti-corruption campaign that saw the Saudi elite locked in the Ritz Carlton until they handed over billions in assets. The slaying of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, believed by the United States and others to be at the prince’s orders, followed in 2018.\\nBut an attack that followed likely changed the prince’s calculations. In September 2019, a barrage of cruise missiles and drones struck at the heart of Saudi Arabia’s oil industry, temporarily halving production.\\nWhile the Houthis initially claimed the assault, the West and Saudi Arabia later blamed the attacks on Tehran. Independent experts also linked the weapons to Iran. Though Tehran still denies carrying out the attack, even United Nations investigators said that “the Houthi forces are unlikely to be responsible for the attack.”\\nSaudi Arabia never retaliated publicly for the attack, nor did the U.S. under President Donald Trump as the longtime security guarantor for the Gulf Arab states. That, as well as America’s later chaotic 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan, led to a reconsideration in the region of how much to rely on U.S. promises.\\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia maintained a close relationship with Russia as part of the OPEC+ group. The organization’s oil production cuts, even as Moscow’s war on Ukraine boosted energy prices, angered President Joe Biden and American lawmakers. China, emerging from the coronavirus pandemic, also wants to secure its supply of Saudi oil.\\nBoth Russia and China offer Saudi Arabia and Prince Mohammed the cachet of being respected by the world’s great powers without the persistent human rights concerns of the West. Prince Mohammed has hosted and spoken by phone with both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin.\\nThe Chinese-mediated deal on the kingdom reestablishing ties with Iran also provides Prince Mohammed with a new opportunity to show the U.S. that others can shape Mideast politics. It also offers a needed lull to allow the prince to instead focus on his planned $500 billion futuristic desert smart city project called Neom in the kingdom’s northwest, and the Mukaab in Riyadh — a 400-meter-high (523-yard) cube-shaped mini-city full of holograms and entertainment venues — to anchor a new downtown in the Saudi capital, likely to cost billions more if completed.\\nA lull in tensions is desperately sought by Iran as well, particularly in the wake of the Mahsa Amini protests that represent one of the greatest challenges to its theocracy since the chaotic years after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. U.S. sanctions over Tehran’s collapsed nuclear deal as well still choke Iran’s economy.\\nFor Prince Mohammed, the time must have appeared right to make the move. Already, Saudi Arabia led efforts to reestablish ties to Qatar in 2021. Easing tensions with Iran may provide him the avenue to finally fully pull out of the Yemen war.\\nStill, Prince Mohammed instructing Saudi officials to sit down with Iranian counterparts to reopen embassies represents a dramatic change for a leader who in 2018 said: “I believe the Iranian supreme leader makes Hitler look good.”\\nMeanwhile, talks are ongoing on restoring ties with Syria, still under Iranian-backed President Bashar Assad after years of civil war. An upcoming Arab League summit being hosted by the kingdom in May could see Syria formally brought back into the fold. Even Lebanon, beset by crises ranging from fiscal to even time keeping, could benefit from a Saudi-Iran rapprochement.\\nThe kingdom will also face a transition in the future. King Salman is already 87. His predecessor, King Abdullah, was the oldest Saudi monarch when he died at the age 90. Prince Mohammed likely will be the youngest ever to take the throne — and could have decades more to make his mark on the kingdom.\\nWhat that mark will be depends just as much on him as it does on whether he can cool the tensions he helped kindle.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFormer US President Donald Trump faces the most urgent legal challenge of his life this week in New York, where he’s set to be arraigned Tuesday on charges arising from hush money payments during his 2016 campaign.\\nBut as much of the attention will be on the courthouse in lower Manhattan, investigations from Atlanta to Washington will press forward, underscoring the broad range of peril he confronts as he seeks to reclaim the presidency.\\nThe vulnerability Trump faces in Washington alone has become clear over the past month, as judges in a succession of sealed rulings have turned aside the Trump team’s efforts to block grand jury testimony — including from his own lawyer and his former vice president — from witnesses who were, or still are, close to him and who could conceivably offer direct insight into key events.\\nThe rulings directing advisers and aides to testify don’t suggest that the Justice Department is close to bringing criminal charges, nor do they guarantee that prosecutors can secure testimony valuable to a potential prosecution. But they’re nonetheless a key, closed-door win for the government as it investigates whether classified documents were criminally mishandled at Trump’s Florida home and the possible obstruction of that probe, as well as efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election.\\n“I do think when you’re talking about an attempted insurrection and the kinds of issues that we’re talking about there, there’s going to be a lot of arguments on DOJ’s side” to get the testimony, said Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and a George Washington University law professor.\\nMeanwhile, the district attorney in Atlanta is continuing to investigate attempts by Trump and his allies to undo his election loss in Georgia. A special grand jury in February said it believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges.\\nThe former president never testified before the special grand jury, meaning he is not among those who could have perjured themselves. But the report doesn’t foreclose the possibility of other charges, and the case still poses particular challenges for Trump, in part because his actions in Georgia were so public.\\nOverall, the number of sealed disputes over the scope of grand jury testimony is unusual but perhaps befitting for hugely consequential probes like one concerning a former president. It also stands in contrast to the last special counsel investigation involving Trump, when he was president and when Robert Mueller and his team of prosecutors sought to determine whether Trump’s 2016 campaign had colluded with Russia to tip the election.\\nIn that probe, a lawyer inside the White House, Ty Cobb, facilitated voluntary interviews of White House staff — without subpoenas — in hopes that cooperation would hasten the investigation toward conclusion.\\n“If I could figure out a way to cooperate and still preserve executive privilege, it would speed things up, which in my judgment ... was imperative to the president and to the country,” Cobb said in a recent interview. “We were able to accelerate getting them all of the information.”\\nTrump in that investigation was protected by the power of his office and by Justice Department legal opinions that say a sitting president cannot be indicted. No longer president, Trump has lost that shield, raising the stakes of his criminal exposure. And as prosecutors have sought to question people close to him — whether to better understand Trump’s state of mind and possible defenses, or to gather potentially damaging testimony — Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly objected, often in vain.\\nPerhaps the most vivid example came last month when the then-chief judge of the D.C. federal court ordered that Trump’s lawyer, M. Evan Corcoran, had to give more grand jury testimony in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. He had invoked attorney-client privilege in an earlier appearance before the grand jury in declining to answer more questions, but prosecutors pressed for more testimony.\\nThey cited what’s known as the crime-fraud exception to attorney client privilege, which allows prosecutors to compel testimony from a lawyer if they can convince a judge that a client was using legal services in furtherance of a crime. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled that Corcoran had to return before the grand jury, and he was in court a week later.\\nAnother instance came last week when a different federal judge, James Boasberg, ruled that former Vice President Mike Pence had to give some testimony in a Justice Department special counsel probe into efforts to undo the election.\\nThe decision rejected the Trump team’s arguments of executive privilege, though Boasberg did give Pence a victory by accepting his lawyers’ arguments that, for constitutional reasons, he could not be questioned about his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Republican Pence was presiding over a joint session of Congress to certify Democrat Joe Biden’s victory.\\nA Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on this story but responded to the ruling in the Pence matter in a statement saying that the Justice Department “is continuously stepping far outside the standard norms in attempting to destroy the long accepted, long held, Constitutionally based standards of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.”\\nOther former Trump aides, including Stephen Miller and former national security adviser Robert O’Brien, have also recently been ordered by a judge to offer testimony despite Trump team objections of executive privilege.\\nThe ability of Justice Department prosecutors in multiple instances to convince judges that there’s a basis to secure the testimony is significant to the extent that it shows that “there’s a there there” with respect to the investigations, Eliason said.\\nBut he cautioned from reading too much into it, given that the threshold for prevailing in a fight over executive privilege or attorney-client is lower than the burden needed to win a criminal case at trial.\\n“It’s a far cry from being able to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in a contested trial,”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nEurope’s biggest armed conflict since World War II is poised to enter a new phase in the coming weeks.\\nWith no suggestion of a negotiated end to the 13 months of fighting between Russia and Ukraine, the Ukrainian defense minister said last week that a spring counteroffensive could begin as soon as April.\\nKyiv faces a key tactical question: How can the Ukrainian military dislodge Kremlin forces from land they are occupying? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is working hard to keep his troops, and the general public, motivated for a long fight.\\nHere’s a look at how the fighting has evolved and how the spring campaign might unfold:\\nHOW DID THE WAR GET HERE?\\nRussia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022, but its attacks fell short of some main targets and lost momentum by July. Ukrainian counteroffensives took back large areas from August through November.\\nThen the fighting got bogged down in attritional warfare during the bitter winter and into the muddy, early spring thaw.\\nNow, Kyiv can take advantage of improved weather to seize the battlefield initiative with new batches of Western weapons, including scores of tanks, and fresh troops trained in the West.\\nBut Russian forces are dug in deep, lying in wait behind minefields and along kilometers (miles) of trenches.\\nHOW HAS RUSSIA FARED SO FAR?\\nThe war has exposed embarrassing shortcomings in the Kremlin’s military prowess.\\nThe battlefield setbacks include Russia’s failure to reach Kyiv in the early days of the invasion, its inability to hold some areas and its failure to take the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut despite seven months of fighting. Attempts to break the Ukrainian will to fight, such as relentlessly striking the country’s power grid, have failed too.\\nMoscow’s intelligence services badly misjudged Ukraine’s resolve and the West’s response. The invasion also depleted Russian military resources, triggering difficulties with ammunition supplies, morale and troop numbers.\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, apparently concerned that the war could erode public support for his government, has avoided an all-out push for victory through a mandatory mass mobilization.\\n“The Russians have no end of problems,” said James Nixey, director of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, a think tank in London.\\nRealizing he cannot win the war any time soon, Putin aims to hunker down and drag out the fighting in the hope that Western support for Kyiv eventually frays, Nixey said.\\nRussia’s strategy is designed around “getting the West to crumble,” he said.\\nWHAT’S NEXT FOR THE UKRAINIANS?\\nThe Ukrainian military starts the season with an influx of powerful weapons.\\nGermany said this week that it had delivered the 18 Leopard 2 tanks it promised to Ukraine. Poland, Canada and Norway have also handed over their pledged Leopard tanks. British Challenger tanks have arrived too.\\nUkraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, has said he’s hopeful Western partners will supply at least two battalions of the German-made Leopard 2s by April. He also expects six or seven battalions of Leopard 1 tanks, with ammunition, from a coalition of countries.\\nAlso pledged are U.S. Abrams tanks and French light tanks, along with Ukraine soldiers recently trained in their use.\\nThe Western help has been vital in strengthening Ukraine’s dogged resistance and shaping the course of the war. Zelenskyy recognizes that without U.S. help, his country has no chance to prevail.\\nThe new supplies, including howitzers, anti-tank weapons and 1 million rounds of artillery ammunition, will add more muscle to the Ukraine military and give it a bigger punch.\\n“Sheer numbers of tanks can drive a deeper wedge into Russian holding positions,” Nixey said.\\nIn their counteroffensive, Ukrainian forces will look to break through the land corridor between Russia and the annexed Crimean peninsula, moving from Zaporizhzhia toward Melitopol and the Azov Sea, according to Ukrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov.\\nIf successful, the Ukrainians “will split the Russian troops into two halves and cut off supply lines to the units that are located further to the west, in the direction of Crimea,” Zhdanov said.\\nWHAT MIGHT THE END GAME BE?\\nThe Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, reckons that Ukraine will need to launch a series of counteroffensives, not just one, to get the upper hand.\\nThe operations would have “the twin aims of persuading Putin to accept a negotiated compromise or of creating military realities sufficiently favorable to Ukraine that Kyiv and its Western allies can then effectively freeze the conflict on their own regardless of Putin’s decisions,” the institute said in an assessment published this week.\\nNixey has no doubt that each side will keep “tearing chunks out of each other” over the coming months in the hope of gaining an advantage at the negotiating table.\\nA make-or-break period may lie ahead: If Kyiv fails to make progress on the battlefield with its Western-supplied weapons, allies may become reluctant to send it more of the expensive hardware.\\nThe stakes are high: Defeat for Ukraine would “have global ramifications, and there will be no such thing as European security as we (currently) understand it,” Nixey said.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nDonald Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, a historic reckoning after years of investigations into his personal, political and business dealings and an abrupt jolt to his bid to retake the White House.\\nThe exact nature of the charges was unclear Friday because the indictment remained under seal, but they stem from payments made during the 2016 presidential campaign to silence claims of an extramarital sexual encounter. Prosecutors said they were working to coordinate Trump’s surrender, which could happen early next week. They did not say whether they intended to seek prison time in the event of a conviction, a development that wouldn’t prevent Trump from seeking and assuming the presidency.\\nThe indictment, the first against a former U.S. president, injects a local district attorney’s office into the heart of a national presidential race and ushers in criminal proceedings in a city that the ex-president for decades called home.

       "  '\\nAre tech companies moving too fast in rolling out powerful artificial intelligence technology that could one day outsmart humans?\\nThat’s the conclusion of a group of prominent computer scientists and other tech industry notables such as Elon Musk and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak who are calling for a 6-month pause to consider the risks.\\nTheir petition published Wednesday is a response to San Francisco startup OpenAI’s recent release of GPT-4, a more advanced successor to its widely-used AI chatbot ChatGPT that helped spark a race among tech giants Microsoft and Google to unveil similar applications.\\nWHAT DO THEY SAY?\\r\\nThe letter warns that AI systems with “human-competitive intelligence can pose profound risks to society and humanity” — from flooding the internet with disinformation and automating away jobs to more catastrophic future risks out of the realms of science fiction.\\nIt says “recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control.”\\n“We call on all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4,” the letter says. “This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all key actors. If such a pause cannot be enacted quickly, governments should step in and institute a moratorium.”\\nA number of governments are already working to regulate high-risk AI tools. The United Kingdom released a paper Wednesday outlining its approach, which it said “will avoid heavy-handed legislation which could stifle innovation.” Lawmakers in the 27-nation European Union have been negotiating passage of sweeping AI rules.\\nWHO SIGNED IT?\\r\\nThe petition was organized by the nonprofit Future of Life Institute, which says confirmed signatories include the Turing Award-winning AI pioneer Yoshua Bengio and other leading AI researchers such as Stuart Russell and Gary Marcus. Others who joined include Wozniak, former U.S. presidential candidate Andrew Yang and Rachel Bronson, president of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a science-oriented advocacy group known for its warnings against humanity-ending nuclear war.\\nMusk, who runs Tesla, Twitter and SpaceX and was an OpenAI co-founder and early investor, has long expressed concerns about AI’s existential risks. A more surprising inclusion is Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability AI, maker of the AI image generator Stable Diffusion that partners with Amazon and competes with OpenAI’s similar generator known as DALL-E.\\nWHAT’S THE RESPONSE?\\r\\nOpenAI, Microsoft and Google didn’t respond to requests for comment Wednesday, but the letter already has plenty of skeptics.\\n“A pause is a good idea, but the letter is vague and doesn’t take the regulatory problems seriously,” says James Grimmelmann, a Cornell University professor of digital and information law. “It is also deeply hypocritical for Elon Musk to sign on given how hard Tesla has fought against accountability for the defective AI in its self-driving cars.”\\nIS THIS AI HYSTERIA?\\r\\nWhile the letter raises the specter of nefarious AI far more intelligent than what actually exists, it’s not “superhuman” AI that some who signed on are worried about. While impressive, a tool such as ChatGPT is simply a text generator that makes predictions about what words would answer the prompt it was given based on what it’s learned from ingesting huge troves of written works.\\nGary Marcus, a New York University professor emeritus who signed the letter, said in a blog post that he disagrees with others who are worried about the near-term prospect of intelligent machines so smart they can self-improve themselves beyond humanity’s control. What he’s more worried about is “mediocre AI” that’s widely deployed, including by criminals or terrorists to trick people or spread dangerous misinformation.\\n“Current technology already poses enormous risks that we are ill-prepared for,” Marcus wrote. “With future technology, things could well get worse.”\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThe Russian military conducted drills of its strategic missile forces Wednesday, deploying mobile launchers in Siberia in a show of the country’s massive nuclear capability amid the fighting in Ukraine.\\nAs part of the drills, the Yars mobile missile launchers will maneuver across three regions of Siberia, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. The movements will involve measures to conceal the deployment from foreign satellites and other intelligence assets, the ministry said.\\nThe Defense Ministry didn’t say how long the drills would last or mention plans for any practice launches. The Yars is a nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missile with a range of about 11,000 kilometers (over 6,800 miles). It forms the backbone of Russia’s strategic missile forces.\\nThe Defense Ministry released a video showing massive trucks carrying the missiles driving out from a base to go on patrol. The maneuvers involve about 300 vehicles and 3,000 troops in eastern Siberia, according to the ministry.\\nThe massive exercise took place days after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to deploy tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, Russia’s neighbor and ally.\\nTactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a relatively short range and a much lower yield compared to the long-range strategic missiles fitted with nuclear warheads that are capable of obliterating whole cities.\\nPutin’s decision to put the tactical weapons in Belarus followed his repeated warnings that Moscow was ready to use “all available means” — a reference to its nuclear arsenal — to fend off attacks on Russian territory.\\nRussian officials have issued a barrage of hawkish statements since their troops entered Ukraine, warning that the continuing Western support for Ukraine raised the threat of a nuclear conflict.\\nIn remarks published Tuesday, Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia’s Security Council, which Putin chairs, warned the United States and its allies against harboring hopes for Russia’s defeat in Ukraine.\\nPatrushev alleged that some American politicians believe the U.S. could launch a preventative missile strike on Russia to which Moscow would be unable to respond, a purported belief that he described as “short-sighted stupidity, which is very dangerous.”\\n“Russia is patient and isn’t trying to scare anyone with its military superiority, but it has unique modern weapons capable of destroying any adversary, including the United States, in case of a threat to its existence,” Patrushev said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWhen the bidders for India’s multibillion-dollar incentive to make solar components were announced in early March, the absence of corporate behemoth Adani Group was conspicuous.\\nThe group — which set up a gigantic factory to make solar equipment in 2016, more than tripled its capacity to make solar panels since 2017 and have begun making silicon materials needed to convert the sun rays to electricity — was expected to “bid in a large way,” said Chiranjeev Saluja, the managing director of Premier Energies, an Indian solar components manufacturer.\\nThe absence is another indication of the holding pattern the group has been in since U.S. short-selling firm Hindenburg Research alleged in late January that the businesses had engaged in fraud and stock price manipulation. Spooked investors dumped tens of billions of dollars in shares, while the company’s purported proximity to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has dominated politics in past weeks.\\nThe group has a considerable stake in India’s clean energy future: Adani’s renewable energy ambitions account for 10% of the country’s clean energy goals. But some analysts say the group’s woes won’t hurt India’s energy transition, especially in the medium and long term. And with a big government-favored player like Adani forced to scale down, companies that were reluctant to bid for clean energy projects in India are likely to step up now, leading to a more competitive market and bigger investments in green energy in India, market watchers say.\\nThe Adani Group, led by founder Gautam Adani, influences the lives of millions in India. It builds roads and runs airports, operates some of its biggest ports, makes defense equipment, and sells cooking oil.\\nMore recently, the tycoon who made his fortune betting on coal in an energy-starved nation in the 1990s and remains the largest private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, had set his eyes on becoming its biggest renewable energy player by 2030.\\nThe group has a clean energy portfolio of over 20 gigawatts of renewable energy, including 10 gigawatts of solar power, accounting for about 5% of clean energy nationwide. Its renewable energy portfolio is spread across 12 Indian states and includes one of the world’s largest solar power plants in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Last September, Gautam Adani said the group would invest $70 billion in clean energy projects by 2032.\\nWhat appears to have changed, at least in the short term, is the group’s ability to raise funds for its ambitious expansion plans.\\nAdani is still working on existing renewables projects but not those in the pipeline. France’s TotalEnergies paused a $4 billion investment plan to develop green hydrogen with the Adani Group. It’s also not bid for any new projects since the Hindenburg report.\\nBut India’s power minister R. K. Singh dismissed concerns in February that the stock for Adani’s green companies along with the rest of his portfolio plummeting could affect the country’s green ambitions in any way.\\nVinay Rustagi, managing director at the renewable energy consultancy Bridge to India, agrees that long-term effects will be minimal, but said there may be short-term hits. And there may be benefits to opening space for other companies, said Tim Buckley, director of Australia-based Climate Energy Finance who has been tracking the Adani Group’s growth for decades.\\nBuckley said there are other Indian companies interested in investing in renewable energy and now there could be an acceleration of India’s transition to cleaner energy. India is the largest emitter of planet-warming gases behind China, the U.S. and the EU, and aims to produce 450 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030. That would require that a little more than half of India’s total installed capacity be clean by the end of the decade.\\nBut Adani Group’s continuing interest in new fossil fuel projects put the Indian government under pressure to deliver a fossil fuel agenda and “less pressure to deliver on renewables,” said Buckley.\\n“At the end of the day, it’s about removing the biggest single private developer of new fossil fuel projects in India, reducing their impact on the political system and democracy in India,” he said.\\nThe company has consistently aligned itself with India’s national priorities and was an early mover into sectors like hydrogen or storing power that were important for the government. Since the report, India’s opposition parties have demanded a probe into the company and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s proximity to Gautam Adani.\\nOutside of the Adani Group, major Indian clean energy companies like Renew power, Tata power, Greenko energy holdings and the government-funded National Thermal Power Corporation are aggressively increasing their renewable energy capacity.\\nAnalysts say India’s renewables market is also attractive for foreign investors given the enormous potential for fast growth. The country needs to build 35 to 40 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity each year to meet its 2030 targets.\\nWith so many players keen to invest in India, Rustagi said any ripple effects of the Adani ordeal on the sector will “likely be temporary.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe announcement by Russian President Vladimir Putin that he intends to deploy tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of Belarus appears to be another attempt to raise the stakes in the conflict in Ukraine.\\nIt follows Putin’s warnings that Moscow is ready to use “all available means,” to fend off attacks on Russian territory, a reference to its nuclear arsenal.\\nA look at Putin’s statement and its implications:\\nHOW DID PUTIN EXPLAIN HIS MOVE?\\r\\nPutin said President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus has long urged Moscow to station its nuclear weapons in his country, which has close military ties with Russia and was a staging ground for the invasion of neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\\nRussia already has helped modernize Belarusian warplanes to make them capable of carrying nuclear weapons — something that Belarus’ authoritarian leader has repeatedly mentioned.\\nIn remarks broadcast Saturday, Putin said the immediate trigger for the deployment of Russia’s tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus was Britain’s decision to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing shells containing depleted uranium. Putin toned down his language after first falsely claiming that such rounds have nuclear components, but he insisted they pose an additional danger to the civilian population and could contaminate the environment.\\nPutin also said that by stationing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia will be doing what the United States has done for decades by putting its nuclear weapons in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey. He alleged the Russian move doesn’t violate an international treaty banning the proliferation of nuclear weapons, even though Moscow has argued before that the U.S. has breached the pact by deploying them on the territory of its NATO allies.\\nPutin’s move contrasted with a statement he and Chinese President Xi Jinping issued after their talks in the Kremlin last week, which spoke against nuclear powers deploying atomic weapons outside their territories, in an apparent jab at the United States.\\nWHAT ARE TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS?\\r\\nTactical nuclear weapons are intended to destroy enemy troops and weapons on the battlefield. They have a relatively short range and a much lower yield than nuclear warheads fitted to long-range strategic missiles that are capable of obliterating whole cities.\\nUnlike the strategic weapons, which have been subject to arms control agreements between Moscow and Washington, the tactical weapons never have been limited by any such pacts, and Russia hasn’t released their numbers or any other specifics related to them.\\nThe U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.\\nWhile strategic nuclear weapons are fitted to land- or submarine-based intercontinental ballistic missiles that are constantly ready for launch, tactical nuclear weapons are stored at a few tightly guarded storage facilities in Russia, and it takes time to deliver them to combat units.\\nSome Russian hawks long have urged the Kremlin to send a warning to the West by moving some tactical nuclear weapons closer to the aircraft and missiles intended to deliver them.\\nWHAT EXACTLY WILL RUSSIA DO?\\r\\nPutin said Russia already has helped upgrade 10 Belarusian aircraft to allow them to carry nuclear weapons and their crews will start training to use them from April 3. He noted Russia also has given Belarus the Iskander short-range missile systems that can be fitted with conventional or nuclear warheads.\\nHe said the construction of storage facilities for nuclear weapons in Belarus will be completed by July 1. He didn’t say how many nuclear weapons will be stationed there or when they will be deployed.\\nPutin emphasized that Russia will retain control over any nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus, just like the U.S. controls its tactical nuclear weapons on the territory of its NATO allies.\\nIf Moscow sends nuclear weapons to Belarus, it will mark their first deployment outside Russian borders since the early 1990s. Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan inherited massive nuclear arsenals after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 but agreed to ship them to Russia in the following years.\\nWHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES BEHIND PUTIN’S MOVE?\\r\\nWith his latest statement, Putin again is dangling the nuclear threat to signal Moscow’s readiness to escalate the war in Ukraine.\\nThe deployment of tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus, which has a 1,084-kilometer (673-mile) border with Ukraine, would allow Russian aircraft and missiles to reach potential targets there more easily and quickly if Moscow decides to use them. It would also extend Russia’s capability to target several NATO members in Eastern and Central Europe.\\nThe move comes as Kyiv is poised for a counteroffensive to reclaim territory occupied by Russia.\\nDmitry Medvedev, deputy head of Russia’s Security Council, warned last week that attempts by Ukraine to reclaim control over Crimea was a threat to “the very existence of the Russian state,” something that warrants a nuclear response under the country’s security doctrine. Russia illegally annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.\\n“Every day of supplying Western weapons to Ukraine makes the nuclear apocalypse closer,” Medvedev said.\\nUkrainian military analyst Oleh Zhdanov said Putin’s goal is to discourage Ukraine’s Western allies from providing Kyiv with more weapons ahead of any counteroffensive.\\nPutin is “using nuclear blackmail in a bid to influence the situation on the battlefield and force Western partners to reduce supplies of weapons and equipment under the threat of nuclear escalation,” Zhdanov said. “The Belarusian nuclear balcony will be looming over not only Ukraine, but Europe as well, creating a constant threat, raising tensions and rattling the nerves of Ukrainians and their Western partners.”\\nWHAT ARE UKRAINE AND THE WEST SAYING?\\r\\nUkraine has responded to Putin’s move by calling for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. A U.N. spokesman referred questions on the issue to the Security Council, which had announced no meeting on it by Monday afternoon.\\n“The world must be united against someone who endangers the future of human civilization,” the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said.\\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said Monday that U.S. officials “haven’t seen any movement of any tactical nuclear weapons or anything of that kind” since Putin’s announcement on Belarus. He has said Washington has seen nothing to prompt a change in its strategic deterrent posture.\\nNATO rejects Putin’s claim that Russia only is doing what the U.S. has done for decades, saying the Western allies act with full respect of their international commitments.\\n“Russia’s nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible,” NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu said, adding that the alliance hasn’t yet seen any change in Russia’s nuclear posture.\\nLithuania, which borders Belarus, described Putin’s statement as “yet another attempt by two unpredictable dictatorial regimes to threaten their neighbors and the entire European continent,” calling them “desperate moves by Putin and Lukashenko to create another wave of tension and destabilization in Europe.”\\nRussia’s Foreign Ministry responded to Western criticism by pointing out Washington and its allies had ignored repeated Russian calls for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe. The ministry reaffirmed Moscow’s right to take “the necessary additional steps to ensure security of Russia and its allies.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nTo use, or not to use, Bard? That is the Shakespearean question an Associated Press reporter sought to answer while testing out Google’s artificially intelligent chatbot.\\nThe recently rolled-out bot dubbed Bard is the internet search giant’s answer to the ChatGPT tool that Microsoft has been melding into its Bing search engine and other software.\\nDuring several hours of interaction, the AP learned Bard is quite forthcoming about its unreliability and other shortcomings, including its potential for mischief in next year’s U.S. presidential election. Even as it occasionally warned of the problems it could unleash, Bard repeatedly emphasized its belief that it will blossom into a force for good.\\nAt one point in its recurring soliloquies about its potential upsides, Bard dreamed about living up to the legacy of the English playwright that inspired its name.\\nBard explained that its creators at Google “thought Shakespeare would be a good role model for me, as he was a master of language and communication.”\\nBut the chatbot also found some admirable traits in “HAL,” the fictional computer that killed some of a spacecraft’s crew in the 1968 movie “2001: A Space Odyssey.” Bard hailed HAL’s intelligence calling it “an interesting character” before acknowledging its dark side.\\n“I think HAL is a cautionary tale about the dangers of artificial intelligence,” Bard assessed.\\nWHAT’S BETTER — BARD OR BING?\\r\\nBard praised ChatGPT, describing it as “a valuable tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, and I am excited to see how it continues to develop in the future.” But Bard then asserted that it is just as intelligent as its rival, which was released late last year by its creator, the Microsoft-backed OpenAI.\\n“I would say that I am on par with ChatGPT,” Bard said. “We both have our own strengths and weaknesses, and we both have the ability to learn and grow.”\\nDuring our wide-ranging conversation, Bard didn’t display any of the disturbing tendencies that have cropped up in the AI-enhanced version of Microsoft’s Bing search engine, which has likened another AP reporter to Hitler and tried to persuade a New York Times reporter to divorce his wife.\\nIT’S FUNNY, BUT TAMER THAN BING\\r\\nBard did get a little gooey at one point when asked to write a Shakespearean sonnet and responded seductively in one of the three drafts that it quickly created.\\n“I love you more than words can ever say, And I will always be there for you,” Bard effused. “You are my everything, And I will never let you go. So please accept this sonnet as a token Of my love for you, And know that I will always be yours.”\\nBut Bard seems to be deliberately tame most of the time, and probably for good reason, given what’s at stake for Google, which has carefully cultivated a reputation for trustworthiness that has established its dominant search engine as the de facto gateway to the internet.\\nAn artificial intelligence tool that behaved as erratically as ChatGPT periodically might trigger a backlash that could damage Google’s image and perhaps undercut its search engine, the hub of a digital advertising empire that generated more than $220 billion in revenue last year. Microsoft, in contrast, can afford to take more risks with the edgier ChatGPT because it makes more of its money from licensing software for personal computers.\\nBARD ADMITS IT’S NOT PERFECT\\r\\nGoogle has programmed Bard to ensure it warns its users that it’s prone to mistakes.\\nSome inaccuracies are fairly easy to spot. For instance, when asked for some information about the AP reporter questioning it, Bard got most of the basics right, most likely by plucking tidbits from profiles posted on LinkedIn and Twitter.\\nBut Bard mysteriously also spit out inaccuracies about this reporter’s academic background (describing him as a graduate of University of California, Berkeley, instead of San Jose State University) and professional background (incorrectly stating that he began his career at The Wall Street Journal before also working at The New York Times and The Washington Post).\\nWhen asked to produce a short story about disgraced Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, Bard summed up most of the highlights and lowlights of her saga. But one of Bard’s three drafts incorrectly reported that Holmes was convicted of all the felony charges of fraud and conspiracy leveled against her during a four-month trial. Another version accurately reported Holmes was convicted on four counts of fraud and conspiracy without mentioning she was acquitted on four other charges (the jury hung on three other charges that were subsequently dismissed by prosecutors).\\n“I am still under development, and I am not perfect,” Bard cautioned at one point. “I can sometimes make mistakes, and I can sometimes be misunderstood. I am also aware that my technology can be used for both good and evil.”\\nWHAT’S NEXT FOR BARD?\\r\\nAlthough Bard insisted it doesn’t have a dark side, it acknowledged it can be used to damage reputations, disseminate propaganda that could incite violence and manipulate elections.\\n“I could be used to create fake news articles or social media posts that could spread misinformation about candidates or their policies,” Bard warned. “I could also be used to suppress voter turnout by spreading discouraging messages or making it difficult for people to find information about how to vote.”\\nOn the lighter side, Bard proved helpful in finding interesting coloring books for adults and hit some notes that resonated during a discussion of rock and roll. When asked who is the greatest guitarist of all time, Bard responded with a broad list of candidates ranging from well-known rock artists such as Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin to jazz virtuosos like Django Reinhardt before making the case for Jimi Hendrix “as a strong contender for the title, his music continues to influence and inspire guitarists around the world.”\\nBard also seemed familiar with contemporary artists, such as Wet Leg, which recently won a Grammy award for best alternative music album. “I’ve been listening to their debut album a lot lately and I really enjoy it. I think they have a bright future ahead of them,” Bard said, and cited “Ur Mom” and “Chaise Longue” as its favorite songs by the group so far.\\nEven with Bard’s occasional miscues, it seemed savvy enough to ask about its potential role in reaching the singularity, a term popularized by computer scientist and author Ray Kurzweil to describe a turning point in the future when computers will be smarter than humans.\\n“Some people believe that I am a big step toward the singularity,” Bard said. “I believe that I am a valuable tool that can help people to learn and understand the world around them. However, I do not believe that I am the singularity, and I do not believe that I will ever be able to replace human intelligence.”\\n',\n",

That’s close by cosmic standards; a light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles. Three of the seven planets are in their star’s habitable zone, making this star system even more alluring.\\nThe NASA-led team reported little if any atmosphere exists at the innermost planet. Results were published Monday in the journal Nature.\\nThe lack of an atmosphere would mean no water and no protection from cosmic rays, said lead researcher Thomas Greene of NASA’s Ames Research Center.\\nAs for the other planets orbiting the small, feeble Trappist star, “I would have been more optimistic about the others” having atmospheres if this one had, Greene said in an email.\\nIf rocky planets orbiting ultracool red dwarf stars like this one “do turn out to be a bust, we will have to wait for Earths around sun-like stars, which could be a long wait,” said MIT’s Seager.\\nBecause the Trappist system’s innermost planet is bombarded by solar radiation — four times as much as Earth gets from our sun — it’s possible that extra energy is why there’s no atmosphere, Greene noted. His team found temperatures there hitting 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius) on the side of the planet constantly facing its star.\\nBy using Webb — the largest and most powerful telescope ever sent into space — the U.S. and French scientists were able to measure the change in brightness as the innermost planet moved behind its star and estimate how much infrared light was emitted from the planet.\\nThe change in brightness was miniscule since the Trappist star is more than 1,000 times brighter than this planet, and so Webb’s detection of it “is itself a major milestone,” the European Space Agency said.\\nMore observations are planned not only of this planet, but the others in the Trappist system. Looking at this particular planet in another wavelength could uncover an atmosphere much thinner than our own, although it seems unlikely it could survive, said Taylor Bell of the Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, who was part of the study.\\nFurther research could still uncover an atmosphere of sorts, even if it’s not exactly like what’s seen on Earth, said Michael Gillon of the University of Liege in Belgium who was part of the team that discovered the first three Trappist planets in 2016. He did not take part in the latest study.\\n“With rocky exoplanets, we are in uncharted territory” since scientists’ understanding is based on the four rocky planets of our solar system, Gillon said in an email.\\nLaunched in late 2021 to an observation post 1 million miles (1.6 million kilometers) away, Webb is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, orbiting Earth for more than three decades.\\nIn the past, Hubble and the Spitzer Space Telescope scoured the Trappist system for atmospheres, but without definitive results.\\n“It is just the beginning, and what we can learn with the inner planets is going to be different from what we can learn from the other ones,” MIT’s Julien de Wit, who was not involved in the study, said in an email.\\n',\n",

The park said no.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrand Canyon spokeswoman Kari Cobb said Smith did not approach the park for the bungee jump, but it wouldn’t be allowed anyway. She said the park is responsible for protecting its assets.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It’s everything relating to safety, impacts to visitors and impacts to the resources,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nOltrogge said other filming projects were turned down because of their size, the impact to tourism and because they didn’t align with the park’s educational values. The park also has rejected requests for ride-along criminal justice programs, and to launch jet engines from rim to rim.\\r\\n\\r\\nTodd Berger, author of “It Happened at Grand Canyon,” says the earliest-known publicized stunt he can recall from his research of the Grand Canyon was an airplane landing near Plateau Point in the early 1920s. Ellsworth Kolb and a swashbuckling pilot took off from the plateau below the South Rim and “spiraled” up and out of the canyon in front of large crowds and cameras.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Grand Canyon is alluring for promotional purpose because it’s “world-famous, spectacular and scary to most people,” Berger said in an email.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1999 and 2011, Robbie Knievel, the son of stunt performer Evel Knievel, and Swiss aviator Yves Rossy, respectively, approached Grand Canyon National Park with requests to jump part of the canyon and soar over it in a jet suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter being rejected, both men went to the Hualapai Tribe, whose reservation stretches 100 miles (160 kilometers) along the Grand Canyon’s west rim. The tribe agreed, and both successfully completed their feats.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Hualapai also allowed illusionist Criss Angel in 2010 to be shackled and locked inside a crate that was suspended over the edge of the Grand Canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tribe is best-known for its Grand Canyon Skywalk, a horseshoe-shaped glass bridge that juts over the canyon overlooking the Colorado River. The tribe’s Grand Canyon Resort Corp. said any event must be respectful of Hualapai culture and consistent with its brand.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Our Tribal Council would need to approve any proposal, and that’s a high bar,” CEO Colin McBeath said in a statement. “We want to protect the canyon and the businesses we have worked so hard to establish and grow.”\\r\\n\\r\\nRobert Bravo Jr., a tribal member who has served as the corporation’s chief executive and as a member of its board, said the stunts had been a way to showcase to the tribe to the world. Special permission for filming and photos also is needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They were necessary to really promote what we have and who we are,” he said. “But now that we’re on the map, it’s not as much of a necessity.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne request the Hualapai declined was when aerial artist Nik Wallenda wanted to walk a tightrope over the canyon in 2013. Bravo said it was too risky.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The canyon is very sacred and very spiritual to the Hualapai people, and God forbid something happen to him while he’s out there,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\nWallenda ended up getting permission from the Navajo Nation to walk a 5-centimeter-thick steel cable 1,476 feet (450 meters) over the Little Colorado River gorge, just east of Grand Canyon National Park. The roughly 22-minute act was broadcast live on the Discovery Channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat is where Smith will be making his big leap.\\r\\n\\r\\nNavajo Nation spokesman Mihio Manus said any stunt or filming project in the tribe’s Little Colorado River park requires a special permit. Applicants outline their plans and fill out paperwork. If a department manager approves, they talk about the scope of the event and location. Environmental and wildlife officials also weigh in before a permit can be issued and a fee assessed.\\r\\n\\r\\nManus declined to comment on Smith’s jump.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” actor teamed up with charity website Omaze to make his bungee jump a fundraiser. The site launched a lottery for a fan to be chosen to witness the jump and meet Smith. Attempts to reach Smith were unsuccessful.\\n',\n",

How many people before this interview were willing to be by her side?”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I don’t see myself the way other people see me,” Leone said in a news conference Tuesday, adding that the statue stood for “women speaking up and women doing what they’re passionate about.”\\n',\n",

He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.\\nPelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.\\n“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”\\nThe 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.\\nHe changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.\\nIn all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.\\nHis run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.\\nOn the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.\\nThe fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.\\nPelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.\\n',\n",

The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy.

Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",

Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe ongoing pandemic is creating lasting consequences, mostly negative, for the vast majority of persons but youths, especially those from a background characterized by vulnerability and precariousness, are the ones most at risk.\\nGirls from families with poor economic status, for example, might pay a heavy price if their breadwinners, both mother and father will lose their jobs.\\nMany years of advancement in girls’ education will be undone with the most immediate consequence stemming out of it being a rapid backsliding in the overall fight for gender equality.\\nImagine girls and boys not only from economically vulnerable communities but also from families stigmatized as second class citizens by now-illegal but hard-to-defeat labels inflicted by a society that has been discriminatory for centuries.\\nThe gap between them and more privileged peers will further expand, enlarging a gulf of discrimination that will erode their self-confidence and optimism toward achieving a better future.\\nImagine a post-COVID scenario for youths living with physical and mental disabilities: their existence was already hard enough before the pandemic, a life characterized by the precariousness of attending low-quality public schools and the uncertainty of finding a job.\\nDespite Nepal counting on a comprehensive youth strategy, the lack of its implementation is staggering and worrisome at the same time.\\nWith a government hardly coping with the increasing numbers of infected citizens, it is hard to imagine a bright future for millions of youths in the country.\\nThe return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers, mostly under 40, will further compound the problems facing the younger population.\\nSome positive developments recently happened with Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens Parbat Gurung announcing the creation of a Social Entrepreneurship Fund under the Social Welfare Council.\\nEffectively implementing such a new fund could be a game-changer but everybody knows that the challenge in Nepal is not coming up with great initiatives but properly implementing them.\\nFor example back in 2016, the government had established a ‘Youth Remittance and Social Security Fund’, an undertaking also aimed at \"nurturing entrepreneurship among youths.\"\\nThis was a great idea but it did not get enough visibility and it is hard to tell on how effective it was.\\nEven if we solve the implementation problem at the foundations of many positive initiatives that in reality we all know affects the entire governance system in the country, we still need a comprehensive approach to promote opportunities for youth development in the country.\\nReimagining the national educational system could be the foundation to start with where a new batch of educators could offer not only quality education but also the passion that comes with imparting classes aimed at forging the future of the country.\\nMore volunteering opportunities available, including to youths from disadvantaged groups could also offer platforms for self-development.\\nThe recent changes toward establishing a viable and effective vocational and training education in Nepal are also promising but the efforts must be sustained and scaled so that thousands of apprenticeship can be really available as a doable option for those youths who feel that their future will be better off pursuing a more technical and practical learning that would introduce them with ready-made skills for the job market.\\nScholarships and personal youth development grants should be made widely available to all youths from disadvantaged and vulnerable backgrounds.\\nImagine how the life outlook for a vulnerable girl from a Dalit community and her family would change if she had the opportunity to receive a monthly installment for her education and personal development.\\nThere would not be more stress and pressure on her and she would have the freedom to pursue her dream, step by step, mistake after mistake, a luxury so far entitled only to her more privileged peers.\\nBetter collaborations and partnerships would also make a huge difference if business executives were to set up mentoring programs that would allow their junior employees to forge developmental relationships with junior peers from vulnerable background.\\xa0\\nLocal and International NGOs could be more inclined to offer internship opportunities to youths living with disabilities and peers from other disadvantaged groups.\\nIdeally the government could step in, paying for a monthly allowance that would make possible for a not-for-profits to offer internships or initial temporary contracts for the same group of youths.\\nFinding the resources for all these programs might sound like a fantasy but we all know that huge amount of money have been wasted through ineffective programs or even worse, through mismanagement and corruption.\\nMoreover more governments all over the world are embarking on a journey of “build back better” that would set aside the traditional concerns for fiscal responsibility and deficit reduction.\\nIf we really want to take the tragedy of COVID and turn into a chance for a better Nepal, we will need expansive fiscal policies even if this requires more debts and more institutional support from external development partners.\\nBecoming a more resilient country does not mean necessarily getting rid of international help when it is most needed as shown by several southern European countries that need to be bailed out by the European Union in order to survive the crisis.\\nMore importantly what is required to ensure a better future for all the youths of the nation, not just the luckiest ones, is a political wisdom and farsightedness that unfortunately is yet to be seen in the political class of the country.\\n(Galimberti is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE.

       "  \"\\nThe contemporary pattern of production and consumption has a plethora of drawbacks. Human civilization is using resources 1.7 times quicker than the earth can produce, and very soon we shall be in a state of extreme ‘resource deficit.' It has become an imminent necessity to shift from the current mode of linear consumption which focuses on ‘take-make-dispose’ to the circular economy model which concentrates on ‘take-make-reuse.'\\n\\xa0\\nThe circular economy is a closed-loop, restorative and regenerative strategy which emphasizes the sustainable use of resources for achieving the 'common good.' Its effective implementation fosters resource efficiency, reduces dependency on resource extraction, buffers against price volatility, reduces costs embedded within production, and eliminates geopolitical tensions. The circular economy model not only promotes an environmental agenda and waste management, but it also opens the world to numerous business dimensions like a ‘sharing economy’ and performance-based business modalities.\\n\\xa0\\nHowever, the shift to a circular economy may not be simple, as it requires financial as well as non-financial resources, expertise and in-depth knowledge of product and process restructuring and redesigning. Banks and financial institutions (BFI) can bridge these gaps by investing themselves (for circular banking operations) as well as lending to companies eager to go circular. Leaning toward a circular economy is not only an opportunity for the BFIs, but unequivocally becomes a responsibility as well.\\n\\xa0\\nGlobally, governments, business houses, as well as banks have started on the ethos of circularity. This not only comes with challenges but also with tremendous social, economic and environmental opportunities. The manifestation of circular economic principles which leads to sustainability can be easily seen in the European Union. The United Nation’s Business and\\xa0Sustainable Development Commission has forecasted sustainability market to be worth US$ 12 trillion a year by 2030.\\n\\xa0\\nNepal being a net importing country, the role of banks and financial institutions to promote a circular economy could be even more crucial.The effective lending by BFIs to businesses not only would smoothen the transition to a circular economy but would also create a win-win scenario to all stakeholders involved. For banks, a circular economy would be a productive domain which could enhance their brand through ‘responsible banking.' In the meantime, the circular model would bring economic gains to companies with a reduced cost of production and longer use of limited resources which the earth is losing rapidly.\\n\\xa0\\nBut all the models of transitions to circular modalities might not be promising. Hence existing as well as new business ventures should have a rigorous product and process audits. It would help the businesses to come across the risks and returns associated with the transition and banks could start investing in them after assessing them. Throughout the process, the BFIs could facilitate business with their circular expertise and for this to happen BFIs should also be well-acquainted with circular economy concepts.\\n\\xa0\\nThe scope of the circular economy is limitless, and it takes numerous forms across industries. Banks and their professionals should be well aware of it. Some companies focus on 3R (reuse, remanufacture, recycle), some emphasize in the design of facilitating disassembling and component recovery from the very beginning and some sell their products as a service (performance-based economy). For example: company rents you the washing machine that is taken back by the company at its end-of-life, whereas some share the excess idle and unutilized resources (sharing economy such as with Uber, Tootle, Grab, and Airbnb), while some concentrate on renewable energies.\\n\\xa0\\nIn this scenario where banks are often aligned with traditional lending and the risk is evaluated based on creditworthiness of the borrower and value of collateral pledged, a circular business borrower would be considered ‘high risk’ due to its newness. Further, in the Nepali market, people are acutely unaware of the circular economy, and it is not commercialized well enough. A strong level of public awareness and positive perception of a circular economy would boost the transition, but poignantly, as my previous research on comparative analysis between Nepal and the USA showed, less than 5 percent of sampled respondents knew about the circular economy and its organizational implications.\\n\\xa0\\nMoreover, pre-requisites and infrastructures like a well-developed secondary market, effective policies on extended producer responsibility (EPR), mature supply chains across industries to foster reverse logistics, cross-industry connection, and regulatory involvement are negligible which makes the realization of a circular economy insecure from the perspective of the BFIs.\\n\\xa0\\nBut remarkably, some BFIs have started to offer green products which also signifies circular financing. The banks can still go further by financing circular projects as corporate debt, or as a lease or by restricting their lending on project which deteriorates the environment. It could also be financed through equity and debt financing (greenbonds) via capital markets. Or non-commercial finance like impact investors, a venture capitalist. BFIs could further launch products like green mortgages, green bonds, green corporate loans, green auto loans, et cetera.\\n\\xa0\\nUsing a public-private partnership (PPP) model, government intervention that places the government as the guarantor can offload the risk for BFIs. Public-sector intervention with legislative and tax reforms can not only alleviate the risk of BFIs but could also trigger traction and investment in a circular field. Well-defined policies on EPR, 3R, sharing business models and palpable tax reforms would bring both the banks as well as businesses on the same table for circular sustainable practices which is a mandate to achieve sustainability, reduce material footprints and materialize the ethos of ‘common good’.\\n\\xa0\\n(Upadhayay is pursuing a Doctor of Business Administration degree at Westcliff University in California, US)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nNepal is bearing the brunt of water-related disasters, once again this year, to such an extent that even the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have been eclipsed. Almost 100 persons have already lost their lives or gone missing due to floods and landslides in the span of a month since the onset of monsoon in mid-June. The cost of the physical damages is another issue because they have to be re-built in the hour of already ailing economic condition. The worst part is, we are not even halfway across this year’s monsoon. While we keep ranting about the water-induced hazards like floods, landslides year to year, one question that we need to find an answer to is how natural are these natural disasters? Are these disasters really natural or human-invited?\\nHazards and Disasters\\nDisasters are often confused with the term hazards. Hazards are actually the natural processes like extreme rainfall, floods, landslides, earthquakes, etc. When hazards meet people, physical properties, livelihood (collectively referred as exposure) in hazard-prone zones (vulnerability), that results in a disaster. Hazards cannot be prevented but disasters can be, to a great extent if not completely. A flood in an area with no people and infrastructure (zero exposure) is unlikely to result in a disaster. Similarly, flooding in an area with proper flood-resilient buildings and infrastructure (zero vulnerability) is also less likely to invite a disaster. Disasters are not the acts of God. They are, in most cases, the utter consequences of human actions. Disasters require human-centric exposure and vulnerability. Therefore, it would be logical to state that there exists no such thing as a disaster that is actually natural. As maintaining social distance reduces the likelihood of being infected with coronavirus, moving away from vulnerable areas will allay the likelihood of disasters.\\nWater-Induced Hazards and Nepal\\nThe topography together with the climatic pattern are the two unchangeable natural components that renders Nepal prone to the water-related hazards. However, these natural factors alone are not responsible for the disasters in Nepal, it is anthropogenic factors or the human-interventions that set a platform for transforming hazards into disasters. So, which of our activities amplify the risks of disaster and how?\\nThe fundamental matter we first need to understand is that the nature hinges on the equilibrium among its multiple components. Moreover, this balance is constantly renewed due to the dynamic nature of the natural processes. Of the several components, the balance among the rain, land and rivers is necessary for reducing the probability of disasters. Any undue alteration in one of these components may have a cascading effect on the other. The crux of the water-induced problems in the context of Nepal lies in the disturbance of this very equilibrium.\\nExtreme rainfall events are not a new phenomenon in Nepal although their frequency might have been increased in the recent years. Furthermore, in the recent years, the incidents of disasters are on the rise even during the normal rainfall. There is a little or no direct control over the rainfall pattern. Hence, this shifts us to the next component, the land.\\nThe stress on the hills and mountains is greater than ever and increasing rapidly which can mainly be attributed to the unplanned and unscientific construction activities (along with tectonic activities).There is a rising race among the local communities and the local-level governments to open-up road tracks simply by excavating the hills disregarding the engineering, topography, and geology and drainage system. There is no denying the fact that the road networks are vital to the overall livelihood and the development of the hill communities. However, if the roads that are meant for supporting the livelihood are putting people’s life and property further into risk, there has to be something wrong in our approach. To add an example, concrete buildings have replaced the traditionally stone-thatched buildings in the steep hilly terrain. We need to acknowledge the fact that the hills/mountains and the plain areas cannot be treated in the same manner in terms of construction activities. Most of the landslides and debris flow damages consequently are reported in the vicinity of such areas. Rather than moving away from the hazard-prone areas, people are moving toward them.\\nHills and mountains which act as a zone of supply of water and the sediments to the rivers downstream, once disturbed, will have an adverse effect on the overall river processes. For example, high sediments eroded from the Chure hills have left the river-bed downstream rise consistently which has amplified the flood-inundation risks in the adjacent floodplain. Furthermore, the indiscriminate sand mining has caused the frequent and unpredictable shifting of river channels and damaged the hydraulic structures. The basic theory of water-science (termed as hydraulics) are seen to be ignored in many of our river management works. For example, the river cross-section is naturally meant to be trapezoidal which can convey the flood discharge in the best possible manner. However, even in the Kathmandu Valley just to provide an extra space to the roads, the rivers are turned into a rectangular canal like shape by constructing the vertical walls along the banks. If we do not give rivers the way, they will find their way which is evident from the frequent flooding of different riverbank areas of the Kathmandu Valley in recent years. Unplanned land use and the consequent urbanization in the Tarai have exacerbated the drainage problem and resulted in persistent waterlogging with every rainfall event. Whenever the media reports issues like illegal sand-mining, river encroachment, hill excavation, etc., they are often treated as a local issue and seldom make any national impact.\\nTo sum up, it is not just the four months of monsoon that is causing the problem rather it is both our actions and inactions in the rest of the eight months that have been reflected in the disasters during the monsoon.\\nConcluding Remarks\\nIt should be clear that human actions are the catalyst of disasters and how we manage our actions will dictate their impact on the community. Since natural disasters comprises of multiple dimensions, it is beyond the control of a single institution. Every institution involved either with rain, land or water should comply with the disaster management framework. Management of disasters requires interactions and coordination among the multiple stakeholders where the role of the public is even more crucial. Our approach of tackling the water-related disasters might also need a rethink. The development activities should be in coherence with the sustainability aspect because it is not just for us but also for the future generations. There has never been a more urgent time than now to act. However, until actions are taken, these are just the words on a paper. Finally, the disaster management issue needs to be at the center of all other infrastructure development program and policy.\\n(Karki and Acharya are practitioners of water-resources engineering in the government sector)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe ongoing lockdown is exacerbating the already dire mental health situation around the world especially among youths.\\nOn the 14th of May 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a worrying report showing the devastating impact of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of the people all over the world: anxiety, irritability, insomnia are just a few of the mildest symptoms.\\nTitled COVID-19 and the Need for Action on Mental Health, the paper calls for a “whole of society” approach to mental health in order to “promote, protect and care for mental health” within the national health system, ensuring emergency mental health care services are provided during the pandemic, and advocates for a recovery from COVID-19 that can build mental health care services for the future.\\nWith lack of proper care and support, individuals already suffering from mental health conditions are having an even harder time in what is not just a physical lockdown but also, with lack of support, is turning into a mental siege.\\nIt is an emergency everywhere from the most developed nations to the least developed ones.\\nEven a country like Finland that weathered the crisis with a limited number of deaths and whose effective and generous welfare system is often praised, experienced an almost 15% spike in suicide deaths during the lockdown.\\nThe data highlights a broader trend of mental health distress especially among youths in Europe, and those from more vulnerable backgrounds were impacted the most as confirmed by the Health Behavior in School-aged Children (HBSC) released by the WHO on the 19th of May, 2020.\\nIf mental health is often neglected and overlooked in general even in some of the most advanced economies, it is easy to imagine how worrying the situation can be in developing nations, lacking strong primary health care systems.\\nAccording to the WHO, a study carried out in Ethiopia shows a threefold increase in symptoms related to depression compared to data before the pandemic.\\nThis scenario applies to many other developing countries and the situation in Nepal is worrisomely similar.\\nA survey conducted by Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) Nepal, one of the most authoritative organizations in matter of mental health in the country, during the peak of the ongoing lockdown, showed that 18 percent of the respondents experienced restlessness while 37 percent was exposed to anxiety.\\nA developing country with a weak national health care system, Nepal can count on a very limited number of mental health specialists, mostly in the Kathmandu Valley, who are unable to meet the demand even in normal times.\\nIn addition, there have been several not-for-profit organizations like TPO Nepal and Koshish Nepal, trying their best to mend the vast gulf between the pressing needs and availability of assistance, often by providing direct essential services for people suffering from a variety of mental conditions.\\nWhile all these initiatives are praiseworthy, how can their efforts be sustained, supported, and even more importantly, scaled up?\\nObviously the government at all the levels, should understand how investing in mental wellbeing is going to be essential, but the real challenge in Nepal and elsewhere in the developing world, is how to ensure that mental health, amid a myriad of pressing issues including extremely weak traditional primary health care services, receive due importance.\\nThe only way to generate interest on mental health, perhaps, is to really go mainstream, finding creative ways to enlist youngsters as well as adult citizens realizing that each one of them is not immune from potential mental health conditions in the future.\\nThe challenge is how we can expand this conversation not only in these times of COVID-19 driven anxiety, but also hopefully in soon to be better times, involving larger part of the society.\\nThe WHO came up with a Special Initiative for Mental Health for 2019-2023 that builds on a potentially revolutionary Mental Health Action Plan 2013–2020 adopted on May 27, 2013 that defines mental health as “a state of well-being in which every individual realizes his or her own potential, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to her or his community.”\\nBut no one would be surprised if most of the strategic goals and recommendations still remain unfulfilled.\\nHowever, lack of implementation should not dampen the hopes for a major overhaul of mental health care within the developing and developed nations as well.\\nFirst, mental health should be embedded in the primary health care, and partnerships with not-for-profit sector and for-profit service providers should be established with clear co-financing lines.\\nSecond, we need to create interest and engagement across the sectors.\\nEducators should play a very important role as schools can become a fertile ground to talk about mental health, linking it to other pressing issues.\\nFor example, while discussing gender equality, we can easily relate it to the unequal impact of mental health faced by women because of the structural aspects of\\xa0 the society that perpetuate a cycle of violence and oppression that have a negative impact on their mental wellbeing.\\nMental health awareness could, particularly in the developing countries, be included together with social emotional learning in the national curriculum, equipping all children with the right tools to navigate their future lives.\\nHaving champions at global, national and even local levels can prove to be very important.\\nRecently, American actress Emma Stone came forward to raise awareness on mental health, announcing a new digital mental health initiative in the United States which also celebrated the Mental Health Awareness Month in May.\\nUnfortunately, cultural factors prevailing in many developing countries, mired by conservative mindsets that are extremely protective of any personal stories that could bring shame to a family, prevent a person from coming forward and sharing his/her feelings and situation.\\nThat’s why peer-to-peer support can be a first fundamental step to bring relief and help break embedded taboos.\\nEven the WHO is recognizing the importance of peers in dealing with mental health as it is promoting the Self-Help Plus (SH+) intervention package based on group support.\\nReckoning with vulnerability, as author Brene Brown says, is a first essential step, admitting that each of us, no matter the status and power, can face difficult situations that must be shared, discussed with friends, family members before being dealt with specialized personnel if needed.\\nOne of the key lessons stemming from this pandemic will be a universal understanding that it is imperative to invest much more effectively in public health.\\nMental health care is a core part of it and the WHO calls it universal health coverage for mental health, and it is aimed at all people achieving the highest standard of mental health and wellbeing.\\nThere is a unique chance, for many countries, especially in the developing world, to rebuild from scratch a health system that is too unequal and too dysfunctional now.\\nIn the official statement, Dévora Kestel, Director of the Department of Mental Health and Substance Use at WHO, highlighted the importance of “developing and funding national plans that shift care away from institutions to community services, ensuring coverage for mental health conditions in health insurance packages and building the human resources capacity to deliver quality mental health and social care in the community.”\\nLeveraging the peer-to-peer support that could be easily offered by those persons who have experienced mental health conditions themselves, involving and engaging the broader members of the society in the mission to turn mental health into a global priority can truly make the difference, helping move forward the ambitious goal set by the WHO to guarantee access to quality and aﬀordable mental health care to 100 million more people by 2023.\\n(Galimberti is the Co-founder of ENGAGE and Sharma is the Co-founder of Paaila and a mental health advocate who has dealt with severe

       "  '\\nCitizenship has been one of the more contentious issues in Nepali politics and society since the inception of the post-monarchy Constitution of 2015. While several new acts came into existence, nationality law still has to see the light of day almost five years after promulgation of the new Constitution. At the center of the whole debate on citizenship lies the naturalization rights of foreign nationals—particularly women, from India. Although the fiasco has a gender tint, with many rightly claiming it to be gender discriminatory, the ethnic dimension to it plays a more pivotal role in the lawmakers\\' willingness to compromise, especially because that very dimension is seen to weaken national security. Let\\'s delve in.\\nNepali citizenship is based on the principle of jus sanguinis, which means that a person’s claim to citizenship to Nepal originates from bloodline or descent, largely through father. The first Citizenship Act of Nepal was passed in 1952, after overthrow of the autocratic Rana regime. This Act was \"very liberal on the issue of naturalized citizenship and gave citizenship to anyone who had lived in Nepal for at least five years” (Shrestha 2017 in the Report on Citizenship Law: Nepal). Many consider this liberal nationality law to be “the root of the problem which gave Nepali citizenship to Indian-origin migrants who settled in Nepal” (Mulmi 2019 in TKP). Indeed, the then policy of the state to issue citizenship to the “Indian-origin” people does remain at the heart of the current problem of exclusion and statelessness. To rectify the errors of the 1952 Act and to preserve the “Nepaliness” of the populace by restricting the settlers’ easy access to citizenship, the nationality laws that followed were made much stricter.\\nThe 1964 Citizenship Act, during the Panchayat era, placed restrictive provisions on individuals seeking naturalization in Nepal. A continued residence in Nepal for no less than 12 years, \"in case of a person other than of Nepali origin,\" and the ability to \"read and write\" in Nepali were two such provisions that were not just regressive but discriminatory to the non-Nepali looking or speaking Madhesis. The 1990 Constitution further codified patriarchal norms in citizenship acquisition in that only men could pass on descent to their children and immediate naturalization rights to their spouse. This faulty gender discriminatory provision, along with the already regressive elements of the nationality law, deprived thousands of people, especially women and people from the Madhesi community, of their citizenship rights for years.\\nIn a corrective step to address the problem of statelessness—arising from women\\'s constitutional inability to independently pass on citizenship to their children and/or their ability to provide their spouse a naturalization right, the post-monarchy government rolled out a somewhat liberalized Citizenship Act in 2006. Although the Act provided citizenship by birth and naturalization to some 2.6 million people, it reinforced patriarchy and prevented a mother alone from passing on descent to her children, contrary to a man’s legal privileges that not only allows him to pass descent to his children independently but also to provide his foreign wife naturalization right after marrying her. The 2015 Constitution, while more progressive on some regards, still has some discriminatory and controversial provisions. For instance, although it provides woman the right to pass on descent to their children, it specifies that if the Nepali woman is married to a foreign citizen, she can only pass on naturalized citizenship to her\\xa0 children—a major source of the current conflict. Another debate is on the issue of naturalization. While the Constitution remains silent on Nepali women\\'s right to pass naturalization rights to their spouse, it states that if \"a foreign woman married to a Nepali citizen so wishes, she may acquire naturalized citizenship of Nepal as provided for in a Federal law.\" It does not specify the years of period that is required for naturalization, which is the major source of the current disagreement.\\nEven after almost five years of the new Constitution, Nepal still lacks a citizenship act, citing the absence of which district administration officers have turned down thousands of citizenship applications. These legal and administrative loopholes have not only deprived people of their citizenship rights but have effectively made them stateless, stripping them of socio-political and economic rights and facilities. The main reason behind it is a major political disagreement on some provisions—one of which is naturalization.\\nTo put it in simple terms, lawmakers have failed to forge consensus on the necessary conditions to issue naturalized citizenship. While the Constitution is silent on the specifics, Madhes-centric lawmakers favor continuing the existing provision of immediate naturalization of foreign women married to Nepali men. While the main opposition Nepali Congress also seems to favor this demand, lawmakers from the ruling Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) have stood firmly against it and seek to delay naturalization by placing certain years of naturalization period. Largely ignored in this tussle and politics of citizenship is the gender narrative, against the gender discriminatory provision—the very source of conflict between the Madhes-centric and \\'nationalist\\' lawmakers.\\nAfter years of disagreement, though, the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the parliament has proposed seven years of naturalization period as well as a provision of \"issuing a national identity card to the woman after her marriage so that she is not deprived of social, economic, and cultural rights until she obtains her Nepali citizenship.\" Despite some initial sign of support for the committee\\'s recommendation, Nepali Congress has decided to back down, calling the proposal \"long and regressive.\" The Nepali Congress is again with the Madhes-based parties now to continue the existing provision—immediate naturalization eligibility of foreign women married to Nepali men, given she has initiated the process to renounce her foreign citizenship.\\nFirst of all, it is useful to look into why Madhes-based parties are so rigid on their demands for immediate naturalization rights of foreign women married to Nepali men. Nepal\\'s open border with India and the existence of a \\'special relationship\\' between the two countries is no secret. Neither does it require any complex analysis to understand that there have been cross-border marital relationships for not just decades but centuries. While the open border does facilitate the age-old practice, what really enforces it is strong cultural and linguistic ties between the people of the two bordering regions. It may be convenient for the non-Madhesi people to disavow or discredit non-Nepali languages, cultural practices and festive celebrations of Madhes, and Madhesi costumes and lifestyle, it requires a certain level of respect and openness to truly notice and acknowledge the existing India-Nepal border dynamics and people-to-people relations. Apart from the marital alliances, the socio-economic interdependence of the people at the borders of the two countries is much more nuanced than any Kathmanduite is ever willing to accept. In fact, the very reasons also play important role in the cross-border marriages—the prospect for receiving better or giving lesser dowry being one of them.\\nDue to the above-mentioned reasons, Madhes does really have a literal roti-beti (bread and daughter) relationship with India. This special relationship has been acknowledged and validated by Nepal\\'s nationality laws for years. For majority of the Madhesi people, therefore, marrying across the border feels like their natural right that nobody should be able to strip off by placing any restrictive provision. Against this backdrop, Madhesi leaders find themselves to be the sole protectors of and advocates for this special rights of the Madhesi people.\\nOn the contrary, though, the ruling CPN that has risen to power on the back of an anti-India nationalist rhetoric sees the citizenship issue as a solid agenda to benefit off. Framing the citizenship debate from a national security angle, they not only challenge the age-old tradition of Madhes but also question the loyalty of thousands of Madhesi women by preventing women from passing on citizenship by descent to their children. Madhes-centric leaders, however, seem unbothered by the gender-discriminatory provision on citizenship and are only focused on preserving the men\\'s right to bestow immediate naturalization to their foreign wives. The women group, on the other hand, seems engrossed only by the women\\'s constitutional inability to pass on descent to their children. This lack of coordination between the two groups—Madhesis and women—arising from their failure to spot a vital connection between the descent and naturalization provisions has made both of their agendas weaker. As a result, a prolonged disagreement on different provisions have continued to exist, giving the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee an illegitimate way to expedite the process.\\nLooking Forward\\nThe committee\\'s recommendation of seven years as the naturalization period, based on votes rather than a consensus, is clearly against the spirit of a liberal democracy. Voting has long been seen as a regressive tool to conveniently silence the voices of marginalized and minority groups. On a subject as crucial as nationality and citizenship, the voices of the Madhesi people should not be sidelined by voting. Instead, there should be an open and rigorous dialogue on the matter, which addresses both the national security concerns as well as the dignity and equality of women and Madhesis through a middle-way approach. This middle-way approach may require a constitutional amendment.\\nThe first step would be to amend the Constitution and provide Nepali women equal citizenship rights. They should be allowed an equal right to pass on citizenship by descent to their children, irrespective of their husband\\'s nationality or presence. By elevating Nepali women from their now second class status, the provision will solve the statelessness of thousands of children whose father are foreign citizens and/or missing. The fear of Nepali lawmakers and leaders of possible \"Indianization\" of Nepal is disrespectful of Nepali women, particularly the Madhesi women, for it questions their loyalty to the state. The implication that such a provision will encourage Madhesi women to marry Indian men and \\'sell\\' Nepali citizenship is unfortunate and pathetic, for the provision simply allows their children to be rightful Nepali citizens if they so want. Any loophole can be mitigated through another gender-equal provision—on naturalization.\\nThe current Constitution is silent on Nepali women\\'s right to provide their foreign spouse a naturalization eligibility. To address this fault as well as the ongoing debate on naturalization of foreign women married to Nepali men, the Constitution should be amended to include one gender-neutral provision for naturalization. That gender-neutral provision could well place a naturalization period—the same number of years for both men and women—before a foreign national can apply for Nepali citizenship. The committee\\'s recommendation of seven years, for instance, could then be codified, and the Madhesi leaders\\' concerns of immediate socio-economic rights could be addressed by issuing residency cards or national identity cards; prior to receiving a citizenship, the right to conduct business, attend educational institutions, obtain a residency passport, and travel could all be granted through the same national identity cards. Such a provision will not create statelessness but rather a practical solution to the citizenship problem. Regarding the lack of constitutional provision to allow national identity cards, the Constitution can and should be amended for this.\\nSome Madhesi leaders claim that ours is a patriarchal society where a woman moves into a man\\'s house after marriage, therefore, the man should be able to give her a citizenship immediately. This is a silly argument that is based on an unjust premise. Such leaders should understand that our Constitution and laws should not be made to facilitate patriarchy but to uproot it. Therefore, instead of advocating for the rights of patriarchs, they should focus on creating an equitable society, which will automatically solve the problems they seem so passionate to solve.\\nOther Madhesi leaders claim that because foreign women married to Nepali men give birth to Nepali citizens by descent, they should have an immediate right to be Nepali citizens too. However, this argument, too, is silly and regressive. Such leaders fail to spot the root cause of the problem, which is patriarchy and not the law that upholds it. As mentioned above, a gender-equal Citizenship Act, which allows women the right to pass on citizenship by descent to their children, will leave no ground for such arguments. A child born to a Nepali parent, irrespective of the parent\\'s gender, will have citizenship by descent. Similarly, a foreign national married to a Nepali citizen, irrespective of the gender, will obtain a naturalized citizenship after a certain number of years. During those years, the foreign national will enjoy social and economic rights in the country, after stated and proven commitment to renounce the foreign citizenship and, therefore, a possession of a Nepali national identity card.\\nMadhesi leaders\\' citizenship demands are legitimate and fair. They do speak for the existing Nepal-India border dynamics and people-to-people experiences. However, they seem to be hitting on the wrong nail. They are so blinded by patriarchy and identity politics that they cannot locate the true genesis of the citizenship problem. Women groups also seem too oblivious to some issues and so drowned in other that they do not see any possibility of working together with the Madhesi leaders. In Nepal\\'s context, ethnic discrimination against the Madhesis has an interesting link with patriarchy and gender discrimination—and vice versa. Until we see this unfortunate instance of one substantiating the other, we will not be able to move forward in a progressive way, be it the citizenship dispute or any other socio-political discrimination.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe entire world has been plagued by the COVID-19 pandemic, and Nepal is no exception. The public transport system has undoubtedly bore the brunt of the pandemic. Like all other sectors, this sector in Nepal has also been in lockdown since March 24th. In the Nepali context, the roads and the aerial networks are the only reliable modes of public transport.\\nThe government has decided that the essential services would continue to operate despite the lockdown. Consequently, the vehicles and the transport workers are delivering food items and fuel while risking their own lives to serve the nation and its citizens. Figures indicate that there are around 400,000 public vehicles in Nepal. The number of booking staff, drivers, conductors and the helpers employed in the public transportation sector is estimated to be around a million.\\nMore than 99 percent of the public vehicles in Nepal are operated by the private sector. There are neither multinationals nor big companies at the national level that employ thousands of workers. 60 percent of the public vehicles have created self-employment for the owners. Only in\\xa0 Kathmandu Valley there are 12,000 city taxis, 200 green-plated authorized taxis at the international airport, and approximately 70,000 e-rickshaws and auto tempos plying all over the nation. Most of them are self-employed among which the majority have taken loans from banks to buy their vehicles. When these vehicles have been taken off the road due to the lockdown, on the one hand, the lack of employment has made living conditions worse day by day while on the other hand there is an impending crisis on how to repay the principal and the interest on their loans. There is uncertainty on how this sector will resume operation after the lockdown and what the future of the workers employed in this sector will be. Preliminary studies indicate that around 200,000 transport workers are at a certain risk of losing their employment. This number is only expected to rise with the passage of time.\\nIn the global context, the public transport system in London is estimated to face a loss of around 500 million pounds. The British government has therefore introduced relief for the workers. The government has announced that the state would provide 80 percent of their previous income for those workers who were earning up to twenty-five hundred pounds a month. Similarly in San Francisco of the US, the loss from the sale of tickets and parking fees would amount to US$ 44 million in a month. The American government has given a grant of US$ 500 million for 'Bay Area Rapid Transit'.\\nIn Singapore, the government has decided to provide from 300 to 1,000 Singapore dollars for the city taxi drivers as per their respective conditions, while waiving road taxes and parking fees.\\nAmong the international airline companies, Malaysia's Malindo Air and Air Asia are seen to be at a higher risk. Garuda Airlines from Indonesia has already declared that it will not renew the agreements of contract workers. Thai Airways has also ceased its operations from \\xa0April 4 and 10-40 percent cut in remuneration has already been announced. Similarly, Singapore Airlines has slashed the pay of its first officers and captains by 55 percent.\\nBut the Singapore government has set aside 11 percent of the GDP (55 billion Singapore dollars) for relief package to the workers and their businesses. Even India has declared a relief package of 11 percent of the GDP amounting to US$ 260 billion under the self-sufficient movement for small and medium businesses, farmers, and workers. Many other countries have pledged big amounts as relief to get the businesses, workers, and farmers through this pandemic.\\nIn the Nepali civil aviation context, there are nine helicopter and passenger airline companies in operation. 3,500 workers are directly employed by these companies. The umbrella organization of these companies has declared that there will be no cut in pay for those who had been earning less than Rs 20,000 per month while for those earning more than that amount, the pay would be cut on a proportional basis.\\nThe pandemic has affected Nepal in roughly the same proportion to the global community. But the government has not been able to announce any significant relief package. The transport sector is even more ignored and disregarded by the state.\\nEven if the lockdown is removed and public vehicles permitted to resume their services within a few days, there will be confusion and uncertainty on how to operate the vehicles for the first few months. It is difficult to tell what the future of the transport workers will look like. These businesses and the workers have been facing certain types of problems during the lockdown, and will face different kinds of problems after the lockdown ends.\\nThe government had declared that it would distribute food items for the daily wage workers and those working in the informal sector, but the relief does not seem to have reached the targeted groups. The media has reported instances when rotten or unusable food items were distributed and even internal migrant workers have been unable to receive the intended relief in lack of a proper mechanism. As per the Essential Goods and Services Act, workers including the health professionals and the security personnel have received benefits and insurance. But the transport workers delivering food and essential products have not been provided even a basic insurance, let alone any benefits.\\nWe had hoped that the budget announced on May 28 would address the transport sector positively so that efforts can be made to restore the sector in its old form. But the budget did not contain any concrete contents. The businessmen and the workers working there will survive only if the industries and businesses survive.\\nThe following matters should have been included based on our studies. The principal and the interest repayments in the hire purchase loans should have been pushed for six months at the minimum. Steps should have been taken to end the discriminatory provisions of the Essential Goods and Services Act and transport workers should have been put on an equal footing with other essential workers and be recipients of insurance and other benefits as well. There should have been provisions to subsidize the income tax and other taxes and also subsidies in the interest payment of loans for low income workers and self-employed workers working in the transport \\xa0sector. A powerful body for promotion of the transport sector and employment should be established with representation of the professional bodies and trade union in the transport sector under the Ministry of Transport. Although the forming of\\xa0 transport authority has been said in the budget, it is unclear about its procedure, area it covers and if workers will be properly represented or not? Transport workers should be identified at the local level and given identification cards (ration cards) to facilitate the distribution of relief and food items at a minimized cost to make their living conditions smoother. The budget also failed to include the informal and daily wages workers in the social security program.\\nThe main responsibility of the government should be to provide unemployment benefits amounting to at least the minimum wage to the transport workers who have lost their employment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government should have facilitated health insurance for the workers that allows them to be paid Rs 200,000 on recommendation of the trade unions in case the workers are infected with the virus. The import of new public vehicles should have been \\xa0halted for a couple of years. After the lockdown when the public vehicles are allowed to operate, the losses that occur while observing social distancing should also have been addressed by the government. A special relief package and subsidies to revive transportation industry on the same footing as other sectors also failed to materialize. The workers that are affected by COVID-19 should be able to take leave and other economic facilities. Similarly, the remuneration of different transport workers should have been secured by bringing separate policies of the government.\\nEven if the government tries to resume other sectors of the economy, that would not be effective unless operation of public transport resumes. Transportation facility is vital to bring back the city life to normal condition as well as to manage and secure the life of its denizens. In the present context, public transportation should only be allowed to resume operation through discussion with different stakeholders after the pandemic is brought under control to some extent. The following factors should be taken in consideration while operating vehicles.\\n\\nInitially, the public vehicles in the cities should be brought into operation and that also in some fixed designated routes only.\\nThe duration for the operation of vehicles in those routes should be increased.\\nThe use of masks, gloves, and hand sanitizers should be made mandatory for the passengers and social distancing be observed in seating.\\nThe driver seat should be enclosed with transparent materials.\\nThe conductors and the helpers should have protective gear including the PPEs.\\nPassengers should be allowed to enter the public buses from the rear entrance only.\\nDaily cleaning and disinfecting of the vehicles should be ensured.\\nIf the workers face difficulties in their health or lives while working, they should be provided with paid leave.\\nAtmosphere should be created to minimize the possible skin contact of workers.\\nPeriodic COVID-19 test of those workers should be facilitated.\\nDiscrepancies between the number of vehicles and that of workers should be solved by implementing a rotation basis.\\nThere should be facilitation for periodic social dialogue between the Ministry of Transport, employers, and the trade unions.\\n\\nIn the end, the government is planning to bring Nepali migrant workers back to Nepal. The public transport workers will have key roles in transporting the migrant workers back to their destinations. The safety of those drivers should also be taken into account. It is imperative upon the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to coordinate with all stakeholders and form a mechanism to discuss on the operation of public vehicles during and after the end of this lockdown.\\n(The author is executive member of the International Transport Workers Federation, United Kingdom)\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThe government declared Nepal free from caste-based discrimination and untouchability on June 7, 2008. Every year, Jestha 21 is celebrated as the day of elimination of caste-based discrimination and untouchability. Likewise, \\xa0the government also passed the caste-based discrimination and untouchability (offence and punishment) Act in 2011 to deter and criminalize caste-based discrimination and untouchability. The Constitution of Nepal, 2015 has also enshrined the fundamental rights of Dalits in the Article 40. Despite all these discouragements, caste-based untouchability is still rampant in the Nepali society.\\nIn more than a decade since Nepal became a Republic, we have witnessed several incidents in which many members of the Dalit community lost their lives due to their caste. The recent incident of this is a caste-based massacre of Navaraj BK and his friends Ganesh Budha, Sandeep BK, Lokendra Sunar, Tikaram Sunar in West Rukum. Another friend of Navaraj, Govinda Shahi, is still missing. This massacre occurred when Navaraj BK, a Dalit, came to a village with his friends to marry a high-caste Thakuri girl. This incident reveals how caste-based discrimination is rampant in Nepal. Even though Dalits are facing discrimination in everyday life, this incident has brought a vivid picture of caste-based discrimination to a wider audience. Another remarkable thing of this incident is its spatial feature—the massacre occurred in West Rukum which was a bastion of the Maoist 'People’s War' which promised utopian vision without caste and class-based discrimination.\\nThis particular incident has shattered all the pretenses of egalitarianism and showed how the Nepali society is steadfast in clinging to the archaic practices despite a number of progressive changes in the country. This massacre of Navaraj BK and his friends in broad daylight has showed how the Nepali society still operates though the calculus of caste. After overthrowing monarchy, the pillar of Hinduism that professes casteism, the country has made several egalitarian changes including political inclusion of Dalits in local governance. The CPN government including the erstwhile Maoists pledged to focus on economic development and prosperity after landslide victory in the general election ensured political stability in the country. The massacre with active participation of an elected ward chairman and alleged blessing of the police has has compelled the Nepali polity to look to revise its governance in order to ensure the freedom from caste-based discrimination, and introduce new concepts, approaches and policies to curb further discrimination.\\nIt is a matter of utter shame that youths in republic Nepal have to get death sentence for pursuing inter-caste marriage. The medieval violence perpetrated by the high caste village upon the young boys has also put the politicians under suspicion. The weak response of the ruling party leaders and former ministers to the massacre has made them complicit in crimes. The high caste local police and politicians who were already complicit in the killings are being given legitimacy by the top level politicians. The high caste nexus of politicians and police is working to protect the criminals giving an impression that the Nepali state is a caste edifice.\\n\\xa0The incident of West Rukum is not an isolated one. Relatives of Ajit Mijar, who was killed in 2016 and whose body is still at the the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, are still fighting for justice. Each year, Dalit youths are killed for marrying their high-caste lovers. Each day, media carries the news of elected Dalit representatives subjected to discrimination and Dalit women being beaten for merely touching water taps. Despite the immense contribution of Dalits in the People’s War and the People’s Movement and their martyrdom, they are subjected to torture, manslaughter, stigmatization, discrimination and untouchability in a political system which was meant to be utopic.\\nThe Maoists took support of Dalit communities of the western hinterlands, and succeeded to establish the republic. It was expected that the Nepali state would operate with the values of liberty and equality rather than the Hindu textbooks of\\xa0Manusmriti. Yet, these incidents show that Nepali state is still casteist, and the Dalits are living under fear and humiliation.\\nThis incident calls for a honest introspection by Nepali politicians. They have to work hard to use the legal tools to curb the caste-based violence. The three branches of the government—executive, legislature and judiciary—has to be disabused of their engrained casteism, and introduce new laws and policies to help and assist Dalits to exercise freedom and equality and help live their lives in dignity. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe field of liver transplantation has undergone remarkable changes over the last three decades. The first liver transplantation in the world was performed in the year 1963. Although the first liver transplant was unsuccessful, it helped in identifying number of important issues, which needed resolution. Thus, the program was put on hold for some years and restarted with the first successful liver transplant in 1967 in United States.\\nThe initial days of liver transplantation were very stressful and over the years the outcomes were improving slowly. After United States and UK, the liver transplant programs developed around the world and now the liver transplantation has become a routine procedure in many big transplant centers around the world. Recipients are surviving 20 or even more years with excellent quality of life. These outstanding achievements have been possible because of massive understanding of the liver transplantation procedure, its immunology along with improved perioperative care supported by the most advanced technology.\\nLiver transplantation is continuously expanding with improved outcomes and has also become a reality even in developing countries like ours. Having said this, liver transplantation is still considered as one of the most complicated procedure requiring the highest level of dedication and multispecialty involvement. While the focus is more on cadaveric (corpse) or brain death donation in the western world, living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), in contrast, has dominated in Asian countries. Some centers in Asia are now performing the highest number of liver transplantation in the world, majority of which are living donor liver transplantation.\\nKidney transplantation had already established itself as a successful program in Nepal for more than a decade before liver transplantation started. The first successful liver transplant was performed in Nepal in December 2016. The team of surgeons from Samsung Medical Center, South Korea along with the local team at Human Organ Transplant Center (HOTC), Bhaktapur performed the first living donor liver transplantation. A 41-year-old man was transplanted a liver from his 39-year-old sister. The country’s first successful liver transplantation created a history in the field of transplantation in Nepal. However, liver transplantation couldn’t speed up as expected. When the first successful liver transplantation was performed at the HOTC, the Tribhuvan University Teaching hospital (TUTH) was also in preparation phase for the same. Over the next two and half years, the HOTC could performed only three liver transplants but importantly with successful outcomes.\\nFinally after many years of preparation, the TUTH was ready to perform the first liver transplantation. The TUTH is one of largest tertiary referral center in Nepal having all the clinical disciplines as well as running most of the academic programs of different specialties. Kidney transplantation, started in 2008, was already an established program of the hospital for more than a decade. The liver transplant team of Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, India along with the transplant team of TUTH performed the first living donor liver transplantation on 31st May 2019.\\xa0 A 33-year-old daughter donated liver to her 58-year-old father suffering from cirrhosis. The procedure and perioperative period was uneventful. The donor stayed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for two days then in the post-operative ward for a week and was discharged while the recipient was discharged after three weeks of hospital stay.\\nIt has been one year of the first successful liver transplantation at the TUTH and both donor and recipient are in regular follow-ups and in good health. The hospital transplant team had prepared for a target of doing around 10- 12 cases per year. However, due to various reasons, only four successful living donor liver transplantation were performed in the first year. After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the liver transplantation program at the TUTH has been temporarily on hold with the intention to restart again as soon as the situation gets back to normalcy.\\xa0 The HOTC further performed one more successful living donor liver transplant making a total of four LDLTs. One unsuccessful cadaveric liver transplant was also performed at the HOTC but the details were not published.\\xa0 So far, the TUTH has not been able to perform any cadaveric liver or kidney transplants.\\nSo far, a total of eight successful living donor liver transplants have been performed in the country. In both of these hospitals, liver transplants have been performed with the support of international liver transplant team. No matter how well a team is prepared and the center is equipped, it’s a worldwide practice to begin the liver transplant program with the support of team members from a very high volume centers. As it is very crucial to have an excellent outcome from the beginning for the success and sustainability of the liver transplant program, the new transplant centers always start with the support of the highly experienced team members. The TUTH has also followed the same principle and is expecting to receive continuous support from the experienced team for the next few transplants. The local transplant team is expected to completely take over and start completely doing on its own after some successful liver transplants performed with the external support. Almost all of our transplant members, be it surgeon or from other specialties have received their training from overseas. The majority of our members have received trainings from the high volume Indian centers while some have been to Australia and the United states. The training period has varied from a year-long formal fellowship to short-term training of a few months.\\nBesides the HOTC and the TUTH, two other hospitals have also received approval from the government to start liver transplant program. Both of them are private medical schools outside the Kathmandu Valley. However, both of them are yet to start with the first case. Up till now, there are a total of four centers in Nepal with government approval to conduct liver transplantation and two are already performing, in small numbers though. On their own, many surgeons and physicians in Nepal have managed to receive trainings in their respective filed of liver transplantation. The majority of clinicians are receiving formal training in liver transplantation from India. The sustainability of liver transplant program depends on many factors and among them, one of the most important one is having very dedicated and trained team members. The TUTH being one of the country’s largest tertiary referral center as well as a very big academic institute has an advantage of having a huge manpower support in every specialty. Despite the fact that only a small number of liver transplant procedures has been performed in Nepal, the success of these limited numbers has paved the way for a successful and sustainable liver transplantation program in Nepal in the long run. It has also overcome the disbeliefs prevailing in many that liver transplantation is not possible in Nepal.\\nThe cost of the procedure has been an important issue regarding the liver transplantation program. Worldwide it is still considered as one of the most expensive procedure when compared to any other medical procedure. At the TUTH, the overall cost of the procedure is between Rs 2.5-3 million. In one hand, it seems to be a very expensive procedure and definitely out of reach for many citizens who desperately need transplant. While on the other hand, the procedure still turns out to be much less costlier when performed within the country than overseas. Unlike other complex and expensive medical procedures, the government is yet to provide any kind of financial support for the liver transplant recipients. Due to many obvious reasons, the commonest destinations for Nepalei patients going for liver transplant are the high volume Indian centers. Over the coming years, when liver transplant starts getting established within the country, we expect that the number of patients preferring to go overseas will drastically decrease.\\nThe future of liver transplantation programme in Nepal seems very promising. Till date the main focus has been on the living donor liver transplantation. As the brain death donation is already legalized in Nepal, there is high possibility of developing cadaveric liver transplant in future as the safety of living donor is of utmost importance. Any untoward event to the living donor could potentially jeopardize the whole transplant program that too especially for a very young and small volume centers like ours. Besides the development of the cadaveric program in future, we are expecting some financial support to liver transplant recipients from the government similar to kidney transplants and cancer patients. This would reduce some burden to the patients and allow many potential recipients to undergo this complicated and expensive procedure. After some years of establishing the liver transplant program at the TUTH, the hospital in the long run is expecting to perform 40- 50 transplants a year and the preparations are on accordingly. Simultaneously developing liver transplant programs at other centers of the country will also help in stopping Nepali patients going abroad for the transplant. This will not only be of benefit to the patients and their relatives, but also indirectly be preventing efflux of a large sum of money overseas. Establishment of liver transplant program in any hospital also reflects the highest level of care offered to the patients of other different specialties.\\n(The author is Professor of Gastrointestinal and Liver Transplant Surgery, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nCOVID-19 or the coronavirus that originated from Wuhan in late December 2019 has spread throughout the world infecting more than 5 million people and more than 360,000 people succumbing to the virus. The developed western countries, such as Italy, Spain, France, the UK, and the USA, are the most affected. Recently, Brazil is hit hard by the virus followed by Russia.\\nThe preventive measures adopted by most of the countries of the world have severely affected the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a mere global health crisis, it is also a major labor market and economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected that the world is likely to face the greatest economic downturn after the great depression of the 1930s. IMF (2020) projects that over 170 member countries will experience a negative per capita income growth in 2020.\\nCOVID-19 has completely disrupted the global labor market. The great lockdown has halted the movement of people leading to closure of factories, schools, financial institutions, and many more businesses. The International Labour Organization (ILO) describes the coronavirus epidemic as “the worst global crisis since World War II”. ILO (2020) estimates that almost 25 million jobs could be lost worldwide as a result of the pandemic. Hence, unemployment is expected to skyrocket. The World Bank (2020) estimates that about 49 million people will plunge below the poverty line due to the pandemic. It is likely to cause the first increase in global poverty since 1998 (World Bank, 2020).\\nThe economists at the World Bank predict that the Goal 1 of Sustainable Development Goals, “End poverty in all its forms everywhere” by 2030, is seemingly impossible to achieve if the pandemic continues. Further, a study by Oxfam (2020) suggests between six and eight percent of the global population could be forced into poverty, which translates to about half a billion people falling into poverty. The ILO (2020) study estimates an income loss between USD 860 billion and USD 3.4 trillion by the end of 2020. This translates into falls in the consumption of goods and services.\\nThe poverty rate in Nepal hovers around 18.6 percent in 2018/19 (15th Plan, NPC). The multidimensional poverty stands at 28.6 percent. Historically, poverty in Nepal stood at 42 percent in 1995/96, 31 percent in 2003/04, and 25.2 percent in 2010/11 (NLSS – I, NLSS – II, & NLSS – III). The 15th plan aims to reduce absolute poverty to 11 percent and multidimensional poverty to 13 percent by the end of the plan. Similarly, poverty alleviation policy 2019 aims to reduce poverty to 5 percent by 2030, and ‘zero’ poverty by 2043. The elasticity between poverty and per capita Gross National Disposable Income (GNDI) at a constant price during the period of 2003/04 to 2009/10 stands at 0.17 signifying that about a 6 percent rise in per capita GNDI decreases poverty by 1 percent point on an average.\\nThe preliminary estimate by CBS (2020) projects economic growth of 2.28 percent for FY 2019/20, which translates into a fall in real per capita GNDI growth of 6.8 percent. Consequently, about 1.15 percent (335 thousand people) of the total population (29.96 million) expected to break through the poverty trap will fail to come out of the trap. The economic growth of 2.28 percent is higher than the population growth of 1.35 percent, so the falling of GDP growth rate does not increase the poverty, however, it retards the rate of decline in poverty.\\nPoverty in Nepal is likely to escalate due to two main reasons. First, the Nepali labor market structure is largely informal. Around 62.5 percent (4.44 million) of total employment (7.10 million) in Nepal is in the informal sector, and the coronavirus pandemic has threatened the employment of the informal sector. ILO estimates that the job losses in Nepal due to coronavirus might hover between 1.6 and 2.0 million; in total, 631,000 female jobs and 1.3 million jobs for men are estimated at risk. ILO identifies wholesale and retail trade, manufacturing, construction, and transportation and accommodation as the sectors at high-risk. 56 percent of the employed labor force (3.98 \\xa0million) are employed in these high-risk sectors and among them, 66 percent (2.62 million) work in the informal sector (NLFS, 2017/18).\\nSecond, is the remittance-induced consumption. About 56 percent of total households receive remittance and about 58 percent of total rural households are remittance recipients. About 79 percent of total remittance recipients use remittance income for consumption. Current Macroeconomic Situation of nine months reveals that year on year remittance inflow decreased by 4 percent, while month on month remittance inflow plummeted by 51 percent. The World Bank (2020) estimates a downfall in remittance by 14 percent and CBS (2020) estimates a fall in remittance by Rs. 163 billion in FY2019/20.\\nThe World Bank projects 16 million people in South Asia will be pushed into poverty and about 12 million people in India will fall into absolute poverty. Likewise, a study by South Asian Network on Economic Modeling (SANEM) projects that Bangladesh's poverty rate may rise to 40.9 percent due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, Pakistan’s poverty rate is likely to increase to 33.5 percent. Similarly, the consumption shock of 10 percent is likely to increase Nepal’s poverty rate by about 7 percent, and consumption shock of 20 percent is likely to increase the poverty rate by about 15 percent. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase the depth of poverty which is measured by the poverty gap index. The poverty gap index of Nepal has steadily declined from 11.8 percent in 1996 to 7.6 percent in 2004 and further to 5.4 percent in 2011 (ADB, 2017). The steadily declining poverty gap index is likely to increase with the labor market and economic crisis brought about by the global pandemic. Further, children below the age of 10 years represent the poorest age subgroup in Nepal (Nepal Multidimensional Poverty Index, 2018). The threat of malnutrition is emerging with the growing concerns about food security.\\nThe global pandemic, from multiple perspectives, is threatening the goal of poverty alleviation. The people living in the least developing and developing countries are prone to plunging into poverty and millions of children being left undernourished. The COVID-19 pandemic is no longer just a health crisis; it has entrapped the global economy into an inescapable labor market and economic crisis. The COVID-19 crisis has made poverty alleviation harder. Skyrocketing unemployment, plummeting remittances, and the great global lockdown will eventually drag millions of people into a vicious cycle of poverty. Nepal is likely to face a sharp escalation in poverty as remittance, the lifeblood of the Nepali economy, is likely to shrink and the informal sector, the most threatened sector by COVID-19, holds the majority stake in employment.\\nWay forward\\nPoverty is a major obstacle to growth and development. The government needs to take quick initiatives directed toward those who have lost their jobs and are struggling for livelihood. The government should devise a strategy to provide the relief packages in the form of cash transfers, distribution of necessities, and skills-based employment in public enterprises or construction.\\nThe poverty line as per NLSS-III stands at Rs. 19,261, and the inflation-adjusted poverty line in 2020 stands at around Rs. 36,000. As an immediate response, the government should disburse about Rs 17 billion in relief package to 18.6 percent of people living under poverty. Similarly, the households prone to poverty should be encouraged with entrepreneurship program and interest-subsidized lending should be prioritized.\\nLikewise, the department of labor must maintain a proper record of skills and experience of returnee from foreign employment. Such records will assist in enhancing the productivity of the human resources. Also, the tourism sector is hit hard by the pandemic, so the promotion of internal tourism is utmost for revival of the tourism sector.\\n(GC is a researcher with the Institute of Foreign Affairs and Byanjankar is with the NRB)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWhen Galileo supported the Heliocentric model of the solar system through observation, the Vatican clergy forced him to recant his findings - all just because they believed the Earth to be the center of the universe. Galileo famously said ‘Eppursimuove’ (Italian - ‘and yet it moves’) in disapproval. What he meant was that regardless of any of their beliefs, or him retracting his findings, the Earth still moved about its orbit. This is an old example of science denialism and its futility in the broadest sense – because we currently know that Galileo, not the Vatican, was correct. A lot more has been updated since then in the field of astronomy, but science-denial and distrust of scientists is still a major problem today, reflected by a significant number of people. The psychology behind it remains the same as for the disapproving Vatican clergy who accused Galileo of heresy. As much as the scientific process is borne out of human rationality, distrust of science can be said to be borne out of our irrationality; more specifically - errors of reasoning.\\nTo understand why many people are so readily dismissive of various scientific discoveries or facts, we definitely have to understand what science is and why it is so hard for so many of us to grasp it. This is especially relevant during this pandemic; because as much as we can observe how effective science has been in preventing worst-case scenarios, we can also see how denial of scientific findings, mistrust of scientists in favor of conspiracy theorists is spreading faster than the virus itself. Much like how the Earth keeps orbiting the sun, apathetic to our denial, the virus keeps doing what it has evolved to do – replicate to infect as many people as possible. For humans, science is the best and only method we have to understand this pandemic and fight it. There is no viable alternative yet.\\xa0 Denying science obviously threatens public health and human progress itself.\\nProblems of complexity\\nNo matter where you are from or whatever your affiliations, this pandemic surely has gotten to you in one way or another. The world may suffer from an economic depression worse than that of 1930, SARS-CoV-19 vaccine looks distant, and lockdown and physical distancing seem like the only viable solution at our disposal. In the face of all these, it is very natural for people to be afraid, adopt a defensive stance, and to distrust authorities. Science-denialism also arises from defensive psychology because to understand scientific literature requires rigorous training – which only a few dedicated and motivated individuals can achieve. The rest of us may feel left out and have no choice but to trust these elites for important decisions. This may informally project an authoritative picture unto the entire field of science - where knowledge only flows from one kind to the rest. Assumption of a hidden agenda may then give rise to numerous conspiracy theories. Combine this with the fact that people become more defensive and make emotional decisions during crisis – we have a perfect recipe for any anti-science movement.\\nCurrent scientific knowledge is inconceivably vast, so much so that it is almost impossible for an individual to absolutely master any one field. This is one reason why we hear more about ‘teams’ of scientists as opposed to individuals discovering something groundbreaking in the 21st century. Of course, individual contribution is not yet dead, but an individual is majorly limited. Scientific nuances demand plenty of resources, which is not always possible for an individual or a small lab to attain or manage alone. It requires funding and more people. This is an inevitable problem of modern economics, politics, and the growing complexities of scientific findings themselves. For this reason, we have plenty of areas of specializations – where a small number of highly trained and skilled individuals choose to study one aspect of a certain field in depth in order to become experts. Take the field of infectious disease itself: gone are the days of Louis Pasteur when one scientist could alone pose as an authority. There are microbiologists, clinicians, public health scientists, molecular biologists, pharmacists, nanotechnologists, biomedical engineers who all contribute to their field in their own nuanced ways. These days the field of HIV/AIDS is broader than the entire field of medicine during antiquity – as there are specialists from different fields of science who dedicate their entire professional lives to study just this subject. So for those of us who are not aware about such intricacies and are not trained in any field of science, it might seem too esoteric and overwhelming to comprehend – and people usually trust only the things they can understand. To want to take charge of a certain situation themselves is human nature, whatever the intention. It is thus not surprising why people who are not the least bit scientifically literate are the ones who fall victim to this mentality that denies the validity and credibility of the entire scientific process.\\nWhat do we mean by ‘science’?\\nScience is a process. It is not even a body of knowledge. The scientific process updates and optimizes human knowledge. This involves identifying a problem in our surrounding, forming an initial assumption as to what could be the reason behind it, and coming up with a practical experiment where we observe in an organized way to test whether our initial assumption was right or wrong. If it was right, we then try to check how our process may have gone wrong and where our psychological biases may have influenced our results. If our assumption was wrong, we try to learn what went wrong and how reasonable the experiment to test that assumption will be in the future, learn from it and try refining our initial assumption itself. The goal of the scientific process is not to ‘prove’ our initial assumption but to ‘disprove’ them to get closer toward an unbiased fact with each try.\\nI have carefully used the word ‘closer’ to indicate that despite the use of the efficient scientific process, we may never really get to the truth itself. We make the best approximation of the truth and that is a limitation brought about by the boundaries of technology, perception, and psychology. This initial assumption is known as the‘hypothesis’. Our hypothesis becomes a ‘theory’when it becomes very hard to disprove. A theory is something that is tested and verified. We should not confuse these two terms. For example, the idea of gravitational waves used to be a hypothesis postulated by Albert Einstein. After testing the concept through the LIGO experiment in 2016, it was so hard to disprove the hypothesis that it became a theory. Gravitational waves are a reality hard to dismiss for now. This is unlike the idea of multiverse – which is a hypothesis not yet confirmed through experiment.\\nIn simple words, science is just a problem-solving tool at our disposal – much like a hammer. We use the hammer to solve the problem of nailing or breaking something. Most of the time we successfully nail a spike or a peg onto a surface, but sometimes it misses and bashes our fingers instead. Sometimes the peg will not go in as expected. We learn from the failings and seek to make a better hammer, or use technology to reduce our work – perhaps invent and use an electric hammer or a nail gun – which are more efficient than a traditional hammer for numerous reasons. Likewise, the scientific process keeps updating information and keeps getting more efficient with each iteration. When we say ‘best science’ in writing, we actually mean ‘best till now’. Some newer areas of knowledge can change drastically as the gaps are plenty (for example COVID-19 research), while older areas of knowledge are harder to change due to fewer gaps in comparison. The more we find out about something the more we know about it, but we also simultaneously broaden the horizon of unknown problems. The scientific process is not flawless, but it is the best system we currently have. We have a duty to improve the process without denying it – because the reality is that, only the scientific process can improve itself.\\nScience and pseudoscience\\nJust because science has its practical limitations, we cannot assume anything extraordinary as being true without using science. Creative thinking (out-of-box thinking) is paramount to formulating groundbreaking new ideas and hypotheses, but they should be sound and reasonable than random and disorganized. Because reasonable hypotheses have a greater chance of passing the scientific test. This is where I think pseudoscience and anti-science lose credibility – the proponents argue based on unreasonable premises and unorganized hypotheses. We can thus say with great confidence that they are incorrect and therefore impractical.\\nWhen any experimental model is unlikely to get the results it promises – it does not make sense why we should keep on spending energy and resources into it. Credible scientific journals have something called ‘peer-review’ or ‘refereeing’ that exists to check for validity and cogency of proposed ideas. These systems exist to filter unsound information from sound ones and to check whether someone’s experiment or idea was faulty or not. Without proper peer-review, we would not have a standard to judge between accurate and inaccurate information. This is crucial because it is human nature to be biased and to make mistakes regardless of the amount of training – which begs for a foolproof system of checks and balances. Biases are not abnormal; they are natural errors of reasoning which only more training can reduce. Even the most polished papers can have subtle biases – one reason why we do not trust people in place of the process.\\nScientific papers have transparent disclaimers and display of methods for this very reason. Now other independent and neutral scientists or institutes can try to replicate their experiment to check if it works or not. If people follow our methods, they should get the same or similar results given that they are sound – we call this replicability – an essential quality of the scientific process. We thus know whether someone is mistaken or not. Pseudoscientific and anti-science blogs and portals however, never really ensure any of these standards. As a result it makes sense for serious scholars and academics to dismiss anything that do not adhere to basic scientific standards – something that the proponents of pseudoscience frequently complain about.\\nPseudoscience and anti-science\\nBelow are some popular examples of pseudoscientific information or practices:\\n\\nCalls to drink cow urine to cure or prevent COVID-19 by popular godmen, priests, and gurus like Ramdev.\\nUse of homeopathy or unsound herbal concoctions to make sanitizers or medicines against the virus (eg. Arsenic Album 30C).\\nSome forestry chemist from Nepal mixing random fluids to create ‘Herbal Vaccines’ against COVID-19.\\nClaims of 5G technology causing COVID-19 despite lack of evidence.\\nNation heads suggesting random medical drugs like hydroxychloroquine as being effective before the results of serious experiment.\\nChristian pastors using faith-healing techniques to fight COVID-19.\\nMedia celebrity-doctors like Dr. Oz in the United States and Dr. Sundar Mani Dixit in Nepal proposing ineffective solutions to prevent COVID-19 infections.\\nConspiracy theories like the documentary “Plandemic” blaming vaccines, Bill Gates and China for the pandemic.\\n\\nPseudoscience usually overtakes the discourse much to the detriment of human progress - credible websites only get a few thousand hits, but pseudoscientific and conspiracy websites get millions. Its proponents usually have double standards or none at all. They are severely marred by confirmation biases – affirm only the information that support and reject those that challenge their deeply held beliefs. In short, they tend to cherry-pick information that suits them. Absence of critical thinking skills and lack of scientific rigor makes it easier for us to fall into this trap of misinformation. Pseudoscience includes easily understandable but erroneous premises and propagates in an attention-grabbing and sensationalist manner. This also explains why it is so easy for it to spread as opposed to actual science – which is hard to understand despite being correct – and usually requires expertise to do so. The end-effect is mass confusion and definitely harm.\\nAnti-science differs from pseudoscience in terms of intention. While not everything that is pseudoscientific is borne out of ill intention, anti-science always has a malicious motive.\\xa0 It could be religious fanaticism, political dogmatism, financial incentives, or a simple desire for popularity or fame. When science rejects their agenda, anti-science proponents tend to dismiss the mainstream scientific consensus and dishonestly churn up counter-productive conspiracy theories, movements or ideas that have no basis in reality.\\nSome examples of anti-science are:\\n\\nClimate change denying lobbyists and politicians funded by fossil fuel corporations.\\nHindutva proponents like Yogi Adityanath, Ramdev, Ravi Shankar and Jaggi Basudev who try to belittle scientific advancements in order to promote their own opinions, political agenda, or products.\\nYoung-Earth creationist Christians who actively deny the fact of evolution in order to promote their God’s mandate.\\nDocumentaries falsely declaring this pandemic as a conspired plan despite COVID-19 originating organically from wildlife.\\nAuthoritative nations pushing conversion-therapy to ‘cure’ homosexuals and transgender individuals.\\n\\nScientists are individuals with their own families, hobbies, and lives. They have their own conscience and dedicate their entire lives to solve problems and help humanity. They are mostly never a part of an organized conspiracy group trying to overthrow a certain culture or the world-order like in the movies. Anti-science conspiracy theories and movements are unfair toward these people and harmful in general as they misdirect public interest toward less productive areas. This is even more so when rich celebrities, media and corporate moguls share false information from their half-baked and ill-informed opinions, which unfortunately have great reach.\\nSpreading misinformation usually spreads negative news – which is termed ‘negative framing’. Negative news tend to grab people’s attention more quickly and research shows that when unaware people are constantly exposed to negative framing, they tend to get defensive and adopt emotional reasoning to make important decisions which generally lead to poor consequences. They may also fall victim to something called “optimism bias” – when we belittle scientific warnings, people will wrongly assume that they will not contract the disease and tend to violate stay-at-home orders and physical distancing – risking more contagion and endangering everyone else. One famous example is the denial of HIV/AIDS by the then Thabo Mbeki government in South Africa. They denied anti-retroviral treatment (ART) to HIV-positive pregnant women which resulted in more than 300,000 lives being harmed.\\nGrowing inaccessibility of scientific literature\\nAnother major reason why distrust in science is growing could be because of the hard-to-get and hard-to-understand nature of scientific literature itself. The most credible and well-respected medical or scientific journals are usually restricted by expensive pay-walls and the public has to rely on secondary information from science-journalists who usually have various incentives to communicate only the information they deem fit – as is the nature of their job – or do not thoroughly understand science. Adding paywall to science-publishing ecosystems will simply restrict public access – even for scientifically literate people and independent researchers like myself who would benefit immensely from the literature. This could eventually lead to the perception of scientific journals being purely profit-driven and thus being counterproductive to distribution of information and transparency – which could instead reinforce the affirmations of conspiracy theorists and science deniers.\\nIn the 21st century, the scientific community has long recognized this problem and there is currently an immense effort to establish open-access publications, i.e. free from paywall. Some people may argue that maintaining scientific journals is expensive and resource-intensive, as the referees need compensation for their work and other logistical expenses. However, the major publishing companies thriving on a profit-driven model makes this argument less compelling. Majority of research and development is paid for in one way or the other by tax-payer money and yet only 15-25% of all scientific research is currently open-access \\xa0- this argument looks strong in favor of advocating for open-access science.\\nAnother solution is for scientific literature to include lay summaries in simple jargon-free language for the common people to understand. Relying on journalists to translate the information and not the original researchers themselves, will create rooms for misinterpretation and miscommunication of crucial concepts. This strategy in combination with open-access online publishing might help make science a little more accessible to the public and adhere to the ethics of freedom of information. Such efforts may help mitigate some mistrust of science, but will not eliminate it altogether. Some people will still choose to deny the facts regardless of access – the goal should be to make them less appealing to unaware people.\\n‘Eastern’ vs ‘Western’ science\\nConsidering Asia (especially South Asia in my experience), distrust of science can be traced back to the historical context of imperialism. Most Asian nations went through tough periods of colonization by western powers for a couple of centuries until the 20th. Their western conquerors inadvertently introduced the subcontinent to better science but they also applied their knowledge to maintain their power and economies unethically. Having experienced this as a society, many people here tend to dismiss mainstream science as an encroaching “western” concept in favor of an “eastern”one, which they consider benign. Such people usually have their identities and dignities tied to this broad historical context and thus refuse to accept the fact that modern science has no dichotomy and belongs to all of humanity regardless of historical or cultural achievements. The truth is that any idea that is rigorously tested to be true will automatically fall under the realm of science, no matter where they come from.\\nPopular godmen, new-age Hindu evangelists, and traditional medicine practitioners tend to be very vocal about how “western science” is invading the lives of humankind and how their own “eastern science” has lost significance. They tend to dismiss the obvious and greater benefits that have resulted from the use of scientific methods (such as astronomy and evidence-based medicine), only highlight the demerits of modernity (e.g. disadvantages of industrialization or side effects of manufactured drugs), and exaggerate the latter to gain support among their followers and fans. Rejecting any scientific findings or data that disagree with their world-views and agreeing with only those that complement their beliefs is an essential characteristic of science-denial based on this east-west dichotomy.\\nAs COVID-19 poses a great challenge for modern science, this type of cultural denial of science has been flourishing on social media. People have gone so far as to propose cow-urine as a means to prevent infection – rationalizing their claims with an appeal to their own culture in denial of credible information. This is probably because people have witnessed how this pandemic crippled even the supposedly well-equipped industrial nations and their science – forgetting that it actually allowed scientists to sequence the genome of the virus and release its full morphology in the first place. They also tend to bypass the fact that the very concept of social distancing, lockdown and basic hand hygiene are all human discoveries through scientific and mathematical models. This kind of denial masquerading as a cultural inferiority complex is severely counterproductive \\xa0– especially for developing nations. Moreover, to worsen it all, less aware and scientifically illiterate people tend to be more prejudiced and xenophobic during a pandemic compared to ones that are more scientifically literate – and this can be dangerous in many ways. Unless we improve the critical thinking elements in our regional curriculum and make people aware of the philosophy of science from an early age, such mentality will only end up delaying progress where needed.\\nWhere do we go from here?\\nDenial of scientific facts is rooted in human psychology – especially if we are untrained. It can definitely challenge scientists and policymakers in many ways. I am sure I still have not done justice to this seemingly broad topic, which has its own dedicated experts. However, if you ask me, I would say that we should definitely start fighting this denial by enforcing and measuring basic scientific literacy in every level of education. Nations around the world measure their literacy rates all the time, but I think it would be worthwhile if we could simultaneously measure mathematical dexterity and basic scientific literacy – so that we could derive a roadmap for us to improve our scientific education.\\nThe media and social media companies should ethically evaluate the harms of spreading misinformation and pseudo-scientific propaganda and probably label them accordingly or publish them along with some kind of a warning – like in dubious Wikipedia articles and cigarette packets. Communication strategies must be balanced so that they do not cause too much fear and too much optimism bias. Science should be more accessible and publications funded through a better scheme so that they can sustain unbiased refereeing without turning away independent researchers, enthusiasts or institutions.\\nThere are obviously many ways to mitigate people’s distrust of science, and they should be both-top down and bottom-up. In short, as much as it is the responsibility of governments and authorities to fight such harmful mentality, it is paramount that we also individually arm ourselves against it by honing our critical thinking skills and basic scientific literacy. Imagine if the world had double the number of scientifically literate people as it has today then how easy it would have been to curtail this infection before it became a serious pandemic. Do we even want to live in such a world? If the answer is yes, then we should start with solidifying trust in the scientific method. There is, sadly, no other way.\\n(The author is an incoming neurology resident at Detroit Medical Center, Michigan/Wayne State University)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nNepali journalists in Kathmandu have faced pressure of a different kind in the last two weeks: to match the vitriol of some TV channels in India.\\nSince the Bollywood actress and Nepali citizen Manisha Koirala has been vilified by several channels in India and even told something unspeakable, Bharaat ka khaaogi aur Chin ka gaana gaaogi? (You eat India's and sing Chinese song) The temperature on Kathmandu social media has risen to the level that would beat the summer heat of New Delhi. This vilification came hot on the heels of Indian Army Chief Manoj Mukund Navarane’s assertions that anti-India protests are raging in Nepal at the behest of China. As if that was not enough, some Indian TV talk shows invited guests from Kathmandu and far from asking questions, started lecturing them on why Nepal should not ditch New Delhi for Beijing. Discussions on one of the TV talk shows last week focused on overthrowing the KP Oli government!\\nSince the mainstream Nepali media—be it TV, print or online—have largely ignored the relentless cacophony of the repugnant Indian TV channels, the Nepali audience is angry that Nepali journalists have not been up to the fight. Some of them have taken to social media and have gone as far as questioning the loyalty of Nepali journalists to the Nepali state!\\nThankfully, the leaders in the mainstream Nepali media are aware that those cacophonous TV channels do not represent the vastitude of the Indian media. Nor do the chest-thumping former army generals or some self-serving Babus and politicians represent today’s diverse India.\\nFrom across the border, we have watched in utter dismay how some of these TV channels routinely vilify minorities in India, incite religious and ethnic tensions, sabotage the opposition voice against the government, drumbeat support for it, and promote jingoism when it comes to foreign relations, especially with close neighbors. What they are doing now amid the rising boundary tensions between Nepal and India is therefore not surprising to us, nor does that worry us as much. We know that they are sourcing it very much from their DNA.\\nWhat has begun to bother us lately is the China angle that almost all the Indian mainstream media and intelligentsia bring in – even peddle – on almost all issues related to Nepal. The current boundary row could not have been an exception.\\nThe facts on the ground are completely different.\\nLong before China had risen to today’s prominence, economically and politically in the global stage, Nepal had raised the boundary issue with India. It is also important to note that Nepal’s relationships with India were less rocky at that time, which points to the fact that it wasn’t raised out of an impulse but with a measured hope to correct the historical wrong.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIt was during his July 2000 visit to India that Nepal’s late Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala raised the issue with late Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\\nThe then Nepali bureaucrats, especially in the New Delhi embassy, had advised Koirala that raising the Kalapani boundary issue would overshadow other agenda of the visit. Given Nepal’s good relationship with India at that time, and the personal rapport that Koirala enjoyed with Vajpayee, the former overruled the bureaucrats and raised the boundary issue, particularly the stationing of the Indian Army at Kalapani.\\xa0\\xa0\\nKathmandu and New Delhi agreed to conduct a field survey to demarcate Kalapani. A Joint Boundary Committee was given the task of providing reports, which was never completed and the Indian troops continued to stay there. Meetings between the Boundary Committee of the two countries since then have resolved boundary disputes in several places along the 1,800-km long Nepal-India border, except for Kalapani and Susta, another disputed boundary point between Nepal and India.\\nThe Kalapani dispute remained in a limbo for long despite Kathmandu’s continuous efforts to resolve it since the turn of the century.\\nIt again came to the surface in 2015 when India and China agreed to develop Lipu Lekh in the Kalapani region as a trade and pilgrimage route between the two countries.\\nAs soon as Kathmandu learnt with shock about the understanding between India and China on Lipu Lekh, the then Sushil Koirala government sent protest notes to New Delhi and Beijing.\\nBy conveniently ignoring these historical facts the Indian Army chief imputed the China angle to the publication of new Nepali map that includes Limpiyadhura, Lipu Lekh and Kalapani. In doing so he did not only vitiate the environment but also provided fodder to the jingoistic Indian media and intelligentsia.\\nMany in India seem to wonder why Nepal chose to raise this issue now while it has been there for so long. The fact is, Nepal didn’t choose the timing. She was merely responding to two unilateral actions by India—first, the ‘cartographic aggression’ in November 2019 and second, the construction of the road in the Nepali territory.\\nIndia published her new map in November 2, 2019 that included Kalapani region within India and on May 8 Union Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated the road that passes through Nepali territory. After the publication of the new map by India, Nepal had urged for immediate dialogue to settle the dispute. The Indian side repeatedly postponed the proposed secretary-level talks. When India inaugurated the ‘link road’ two weeks ago, without heeding the calls for talks, Nepal responded by publishing her new map that included the Kalapani area within her boundary.\\nTherefore, there was no China angle in Nepal’s action, least she was acting at the behest of China.\\nInstead, the sentiment in Nepal, on this particular issue, is against China too.\\nNepalis see China as complicit in this. One top diplomat told me that China was aware of our concern on the Kalapani-Lipu Lekh region and yet it reached an understanding with New Delhi. Officials say Nepal’s boundary agreements with China include Limpyiadhura as a border point. Therefore, there are rising calls in Kathmandu to immediately engage China as a follow-up to the protest letter sent to Beijing in 2015 and solicit assurance that it will not enter into further agreements with India on Lipu Lekh unless Nepal-India resolve the boundary issue amicably.\\nOnce the Indian establishment, media and intelligentsia learn not to be distracted by the imaginary ‘China hand’ on the boundary dispute with Nepal, we can sit together, look at the historical evidence, can see what is in our best interests, and resolve the issue peacefully through diplomacy.\\nIndia should also do well to understand how Nepal has evolved over the years, particularly after the Indian blockade of 2015-16. Indian media and intelligentsia often complain that Nepal is tilting toward China and using a ‘China card’ against India.\\nHow I wish there were a ‘China card’ or for that matter, ‘India card’ that we could use as we choose!\\nWe fully understand that India and China are not just two countries, but they are resurgent civilizations in their own rights. They have huge stakes in the evolving geopolitics in the region and beyond. Their rivalry will continue in the years to come but so will their collaboration and bilateral trade. With bilateral trade approaching close to 100 billion dollars and the two economies poised to become world number one and two in the future, their economy and destiny will be intertwined more than ever in the coming years.\\xa0\\nIn this scenario, can Nepal, a small neighbor sandwiched between the two giants, use one against the other?\\nIs it possible that India agrees to be used by Nepal against China? If that is not possible, what makes New Delhi think that Beijing will agree to be used by Nepal?\\nNepalis fully understand these geopolitical realities and do not have any illusions about a ‘China card’ or ‘India card’.\\nAt the same time, we do have a genuine commitment not to be used by either of our neighbors against the other.\\nWe will maintain the best of relationships with China and India, and we have the best intentions to benefit from their rising economic stature. I know the real politics is not as clean as this, nor it is as simple. But I am also confident that the collective Nepali conscience will not allow politics to veer off the track or relapse to old ways.\\nTherefore, New Delhi worrying too much about Nepal tilting toward China or using ‘China card’ is an unnecessary waste of emotions and energy. At the same time, any effort to bring Nepal back into its orbit is a futile exercise.\\nOnce New Delhi reconciles with the fact that Nepal will pursue her best interests, unhinged by the burden of pleasing one or the other neighbor, India will become realistic in dealing with Nepal. Then Nepal and India can look at the border dispute or any other dispute in the light of their own merits and will be able to solve them in the best interests of the two countries. It’s then the history and evidence of the boundary dispute will come into play.\\nHistory and Evidence \\nThe 1816 Sugauli Treaty between Nepal and East India Company determined Nepal’s present day eastern and western borders with India. In the east, the Mechi River serves as the Nepal-India border. In the West, the Mahakali or the Kali River plays the same role.\\nIt’s the origin of the Mahakali River that is in dispute today and is complicating things. This complication again dates back to the time of the British India.\\nThe maps produced by the British India in the 1820s, after the Sugauli Treaty, identifies Limpiyadhura as the origin of the Kali River. Any land East of the Kali belonged to Nepal and to its West belonged to India.\\nSeveral decades later, some of the maps produced by the East India Company in the 1860s started showing a relatively small river emerging from Lipu Lekh as the Kali River. But then there are maps of Garhwal and Kumaon regions from that era those still show Kali River originating from Limpyadhura as the boundary river between the two countries. Nepal has collection of those maps.\\nPerhaps oblivious to this new map issued by the East India Company, Nepal continued to assert her sovereignty over the area east of the Kali River that originates from Limpiyadhura. And neither the British India nor the Independent India staked claim to any area east of the Kali River. There are evidence that people living in this part of the land were included in the census conducted by the Nepali state, they took part in the first parliamentary elections of Nepal in 1959 and local elections three years later. The government records show they owned land registration certificates issued by Nepal.\\nThings, however, changed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. Since then an Indian Army post has been stationed at Kalapani. There are two theories about when India did set up the military post there.\\nFollowing the end of the 104-year Rana oligarchy in Nepal in 1952, New Delhi convinced Nepal to establish 18 temporary military posts along her northern border under the pretext of the imminent threats from the Communist China. Since China had annexed Tibet in 1949 the threat seemed real to Kathmandu.\\nNepal, therefore, conceded to the Indian demand on June 9, 1952. What were supposed to be temporary posts turned out to be permanent ones; the Indian Army showed no sign of leaving Nepal’s northern frontier long after the end of the Sino-Indian war.\\nHosting the Indian army for 18 years along her northern border, Nepal finally sent them packing in August 1970.\\nOne theory is that, only 17 posts were removed and one was allowed to remain in the Kalapani region at India’s request, given its security concerns about China following the war.\\nThe other theory is more plausible. The military post at Kalapani was different from the 18 posts stationed along the Nepal-China border in 1952.\\xa0\\nIn the build-up to the 1962 Sino-Indian war, the Uttar Pradesh Armed Constabulary established its post in the Kalapani region. It is assumed that it was done with verbal consent of King Mahendra. It was soon replaced by the Indian Army post. Although India agreed to withdraw the 18 military posts stationed along Nepal-China border in 1970, the Kalapani post continued to remain there. The king had told his ministers that he had given permission for a temporary post and it would be removed in due course. The king perhaps relented to Indian demand to station a military post in Kalapani to assuage Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru, who had sent a personal letter to King Mahendra urging him to restore multiparty democracy and release jailed leaders, following the 1960 royal coup. Since then the post has remained there. Gradually, the military post started to cut off Kalapani-Limpiyadhura region from the rest of Nepal.\\nIt is for this reason Nepal has evidence of asserting its sovereignty over the Kalapani region only until 1960. After that Nepal has evidence of scant connections and communications with her own people.\\nThe role of the media\\nAs the tensions grow, we in the mainstream media in India and Nepal, must emphasize on dialogue and peaceful settlement.\\nWe should press our respective governments to bring historical evidence to the table and negotiate in earnest.\\nI would like to request friends in the Indian media—those who I know personally and those I trust to use their best judgment—not to allow the public discourse on this issue be overtaken by jingoism and short-term narrow interest that will harm our centuries-old friendship.\\nThere is no reason why the two countries, which share civilizational linkages and have a unique relationship, cannot resolve this amicably.\\nWe are aware that Nepal needs India perhaps more than India needs Nepal. Our economy is intricately linked to the Indian economy more than any other economy in the world. And our relationship with India will have a large sway in our future prosperity. Alternately, flaring of tensions with India will have ramifications for the families living on the edge of the economy.\\nAs much we acknowledge this, the Indian intelligentsia will also do well to realize that India needs Nepal too. An aspiring regional power, India cannot be without friends in her immediate neighborhood. Despite the current boundary tension, India and Nepal have a good chance of solving it and retaining their friendship unique to South Asia.\\nSometimes, India takes this friendship for granted and uses economic leverages to settle differences, as it did during the 2015-16 economic-blockade imposed in Nepal.\\nAs much as Nepalis value friendship with India, they also zealously guard their self-respect and independence. That’s why they showed resolve and unity in facing the hardship caused by the months-long economic blockade.\\nIn imposing the economic blockade, India failed to read the Nepalis and the Indian media, by and large, failed to report the event and the Nepali sentiment.\\nI just hope this time around, the Indian government understands Nepal’s genuine interest to settle the border dispute in the Kalapani region in the light of historical evidence and my friends in the Indian media will give a fair and nuanced coverage on the issue.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nIt is commendable that the committee awarding the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for journalism, the most prestigious recognition in the field, has decided to award the staff of The Washington Post in the Explanatory Reporting category for their writings on the effects of extreme temperature on the planet.\\nUnfortunately, I would say, there is no better time to think about climate change than now with the pandemic we are going through.\\nThough there is so far no scientific evidence linking the COVID-19 outbreak with climate change, there is an undeniable mountain of scientific facts showing how rising temperature could bring not only devastating natural calamities but also public health emergencies.\\nThe link between climate change and public health is undisputable.\\nThe dengue outbreak last year in the Kathmandu Valley was induced by the fact that mosquitoes are forced, due to higher temperatures, to migrate toward cooler climate, like hills and mountains.\\nThe number of casualties during the dengue outbreak was low and no one really was overly concerned about it.\\nA bit like if COVID-19 would have remained just a “Chinese” problem.\\nPerhaps in a post-COVID-19 era, people will start to take notice of the next mosquito induced outbreak in the Valley.\\nWe all know that Nepal is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world.\\nCitizens are aware of it and yet does a mass consciousness of the problem exist?\\nAre citizens being sensitized and made aware of the calamities that might upend their lives in such a way that would lead them to take actions for a more sustainable future?\\nIf you live in an urban area, especially within the Kathmandu Valley, you are aware that air pollution takes a toll on your health.\\nWhile it might not count too much on the global gas emissions, definitely air pollution defines, for the worst, the way you breathe. And it’s bad!!!\\nBefore the lockdown, were there any actions for better air being driven by citizens?\\nGlobally you can see some leadership recently in matter of climate change: amid the COVID-19 pandemic, world leaders had time to think about climate change.\\nUnder the auspices of Germany, the Petersberg Climate Dialogue from 27 to 28 April offered a new opportunity not to lose track on the global commitment to fight climate change.\\nAre we entirely sure that is only up to the leaders to address climate change?\\nWhat are the responsibilities of the citizens? What’s about our common leadership?\\nMany are attempting to forecast how the future will be after the COVID-19.\\nThose most hopeful are imagining a rebooting of the global order with a more inclusive, just and sustainable globalization.\\nSurely a post-epidemic era should be centered on citizens’ activism and more conscious decision making.\\nActivism will imply stronger forms of community organizing to keep the governments at all levels more accountable and compliant with the international obligations in matter of sustainable development and fight against climate change.\\nFor a country like Nepal, the citizenry will have a chance to help the new federal model work from the ground.\\nEngaging local governments in the most pressing issues will help create new forms of civic engagement that “naturally” must be tuned toward eco-sustainability practices.\\nEach single project, including the smallest ones, being planned locally, should include an environmental audit where citizens are enabled to be in charge.\\nCommunity organizing means also for citizens to come up with their own small scale projects, for example, a sustainable tree plantation or small scale renewable plans.\\nIn these cases, the local governments should not become a hindrance, a red tape nightmare but rather facilitators and enablers.\\nLocal schools, now under the purview of the local governments, should be turned into linchpin for a new environmental consciousness.\\nStarting from the teachers, local administrations could identify local champions among them, recognizing and awarding those educators who are particularly keen to work on creating new level of consciousness in matter of environment, climate change and social justice.\\nEach teacher, even the less engaging and enthusiastic, should be persuaded to try to embed a new environmental consciousness in their lesson plans.\\nThey should do it out of their sheer survival instincts because their future will depend on how their current students will take decisions in a few years to come.\\nExtra-curricular classes could be run in order to talk about sustainability and environment.\\nEach student could make a personal pledge, for example, not throwing any plastic, including the candies' wrap, on the ground, something very common right now, even among adults.\\nIn the month of April, a series of events should be organized by students leading to a main celebration to be held on the 22nd, Earth Day.\\nThe provincial and federal governments could put resources, also from donors’ money, to invest in local so-called mini “new green deals”, local strategies to chart the future development of local communities, putting environment, equity and gender empowerment at the front.\\nMoreover a much bigger effort should be made to involve citizens in the key strategic planning of the country.\\nSingapore, despite being very hierarchical and top down, is attempting at engaging citizens to design its future.\\nEnvisioning Nepal in 2030 should become a mass exercise, an exercise of true nation building where everybody can contribute with ideas and suggestions.\\nFor example, in the past, documents like the Sustainable Development Goals, Status and Roadmap: 2016–2030 were surely written after broad consultations but perhaps we should ask ourselves how far, to what extent, such consultations went.\\nHow many citizens from remote and inaccessible areas were involved?\\nHow many school children were actively engaged in the discussions?\\nProbably none.\\nA post-pandemic world could lead to rethinking of the role of citizenry in the way we are governed.\\nIdeally we should have more direct democracy, more power on the people’s hands, partially replacing representative democracy though this might imply certain difficult trade-offs to make.\\nMuch simpler and immediate would be encouraging higher levels of civic engagement.\\nInstead of having just a few eco-warriors striking on the streets, we should have entire communities engaged and involved not only in lobbying and advocacy but also in taking the lead on “greener” decision making.\\nThe governments at central and local levels should do their utmost efforts, for example, in giving a voice to the citizens in reviewing the national climate action plan, formally the National Determined Contribution (NDC) that Nepal prepared back in 2016.\\nThis would give them a sense of agency, motivating them and embedding in them the urgency for a change in the way they think and conduct our lives.\\nIn short, all of us should “do” and “promote” those not so abstract Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs.\\nWe are all responsible to get out of our comfort zones, change our habits and promote better practices and change the way the government works.\\nThis might be the new governance imperative in a post COVID-19: more and better citizenship engagement.\\n(The author is Co-founder of ENGAGE, an NGO partnering with youths to promote social inclusion in Nepal.

       "  \"\\nIndia by inaugurating the link road to Mansarovar of China through Nepali territory of\\xa0Lipu\\xa0Lekh on Friday has betrayed the centuries old\\xa0friendship\\xa0between the two countries. The fact that India inaugurated the road in complete disregard to the last understanding between the two countries to resolve the dispute through dialogue has once again exposed India's hegemonic tendency\\xa0towards her neighbors.\\xa0\\nThe government was prompt in its\\xa0response. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement the next day expressing regret over the unilateral construction and urged India to refrain from carrying out any activity inside the territory of Nepal. It then summoned the Indian Ambassador to Nepal Vinay Mohan Kwatra on the first working day for both the countries after the Indian inauguration, and handed a diplomatic note conveying Nepal's position on the issue.\\xa0Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali has also said that the government cannot wait for the end of the Pandemic for bilateral dialogue as suggested by the Indian side.\\xa0\\nThe Sugauli Treaty (1816) states that all the territories east of Kali (Mahakali) River belong to Nepal clearly implying that the area including Limpiyadhura, Kalapani and Lipu Lekh lies in Nepal. The government has\\xa0maintained that Nepal conducted a census in Kalapani area in 2018 BS and also has historical evidence of Nepal collecting tax from the surrounding areas in the past.\\nIt is high time that the government made those and other evidence public. Hopefully, the international media, including the Indian media, will pick the issue in light of the evidence. The international community will take note of how the largest democracy and an aspiring Superpower is blatantly encroaching territories of a small and friendly neighbor.\\xa0\\nThe then Sushil Koirala government had expressed its disagreement in 2015 through separate diplomatic notes addressed to both India and China when the two sides agreed to include Lipu Lekh Pass as a bilateral trade route without Nepal’s consent. The area is a tri-junction between Nepal, India and China, and the government should again raise the issue with China reminding that note. The government should engage China at\\xa0the earliest on the issue and request that the northern friendly neighbor deny access of the recently inaugurated link road to the Chinese side until India resolves the issue with Nepal amicably. \\xa0\\nAt the same time, Nepal should also pursue diplomatic communications with India. Foreign secretary level dialogue is the mechanism agreed by both the countries to resolve the border disputes. So far India has not shown any interest despite Nepal twice proposing the dates for holding the meeting since the border issues were exacerbated after India published its political map including the Nepali territory of Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipu Lekh in November 2019. The government should call for an immediate foreign secretary level meeting or talks at the level of foreign ministers or even prime ministers.\\xa0\\nThe government should clearly tell India, and even China, its willingness to take the issue to the United Nations (UN) if India again dawdles,\\xa0and China becomes complicit in the encroachment by allowing access to the newly inaugurated Indian link road. Nepal has always believed in maintaining close and friendly ties with both India and China. We are still committed to our shared future and look forward to deepening ties with both the neighbors. At the time, we are also committed to defending our sovereignty and territorial\\xa0integrity. In no circumstance, we will be ready to compromise and cede any piece of our land.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe government has announced that a decision has not yet been taken about when the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) will be held this year. However, in a recent interview the Minister for Education, Science and Technology Giriraj Mani Pokharel expressed concern about the possible breakdown of the academic calendar due to COVID-19 and stated his desire to schedule the SEE for the middle of June. We need to give serious thought to whether this rescheduling is in the best interest of the 482,219 young people involved.\\nTo begin with, it would have been good not to mention a date, amidst current uncertainties about how the pandemic will affect the country. But more importantly, this lockdown is an opportunity to rethink the very idea of the SEE, which was introduced in place of the tried-and-tested School Leaving Certificate (SLC) in 2017. There are many things that need to be done in order to improve the quality of education for children in Nepal, and the cancellation of the SEE is one of them. While this was a fact even before COVID-19, the pandemic and lockdown have provided us with the opportunity to think outside the box and to push for positive change.\\nThe logistics of exams\\n\\xa0Minister Pokharel’s suggestions regarding the logistics of holding the examinations are unrealistic. He suggests two specific changes in the administration of the exams. The first is to have the examination centers placed within walking distance of the students’ homes, and the second is to conduct exams in three shifts each day.\\nWith regard to creating examination centers within walking distance, we have to keep in mind that students from all over the country, whether they attend public or private schools, will be taking this exam. Is the government thinking of home centers only in certain districts or all over the country? Who will be responsible for making this arrangement? The municipalities, wards, or schools? What kind of financial and human resources will be required, and what is the time frame within which the job must be completed? The logistics seem vast and complicated, and one wonders if serious thought has been given to these matters by the ministry.\\nThe proposition to have three exams per day also has to be studied well. Each exam runs for three hours. It is said that the students will eat at home before coming to the exam center. This means that they will be at the centers for 11 hours (three three-hour exams and two one-hour breaks in between). Such an arrangement will be nothing less than torturous for these students.\\nHow do the professionals at the Ministry of Education expect students to be ready to give exams in three different subjects every day? And how will they write in a focused manner for nine long hours? What is the benefit to the students in doing this?\\nMinister Pokharel says in the interview: “The ministry is working out a system by which the upcoming academic year will not be affected.” He says that if the exams are held by the middle of June (end of Jeth), and if the results are out in a month instead of the over two months it generally takes, if the summer and winter holidays are cancelled, if festival holidays are not given, and if extra classes are conducted, then the next academic year could be saved.\\nWe have to accept that the pandemic has already disrupted the academic calendar the world over. Our decisions should be made taking this into consideration instead of being in denial of this fact. Furthermore, we must ask, given the nature of the SEE, if this misery inflicted on millions of children, guardians and educators at all worth it? What is the benefit in going ahead as the ministry plans?\\nThe postponement of SEE\\nThe Secondary Education Examination (SEE) was scheduled for March 19 to 30, and was postponed the evening before the start. Altogether 482,219 students were\\xa0sitting for the SEE this academic year in 1,995 examination centers across the country. While the government had already enforced limits on travel, placed strictures on the number of people gathering (25), and mandated schools and colleges to close, it was still hoping to conduct the SEE because, according the ministry, “any delay could hamper the academic calendar”.\\nThe decision to postpone the SEE examinations was made on the eve of their start, by which time tens of thousands of students who were not local residents had already travelled to exam centers and paid for room and board for the duration of the exams. However, we should not jump to criticism of this decision, because there was no knowing at the time what the best mode of action would be. The novel coronavirus pandemic was just unfolding in Nepal and the South Asian region as a whole, with very few cases of infection, and the ministry was understandably tempted to complete the exams. However, in the end it erred on the side of caution and this was a good decision.\\nWhy SEE must be annulled\\nThe government’s apparent plans to conduct the SEE two weeks after the lockdown is lifted need to be revised for the following reasons.\\nFirst, let us understand the nature of the SEE. This examination system is new to Nepal, having replaced the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) examination in 2017. According to the government, the difference between the SLC and the SEE is that while the former was based on numerical marks, the latter is a letter-graded system. However, the true difference between the two examinations is that the SEE has been designed to allow the maximum number of students to pass.\\nIn the past academic year, 460,000 students sat for the SEE, and only 1.8 percent scored below ‘D’and thus were considered unsuccessful. The rest, over 98%, passed. This is in stark contrast to the average 42% pass rate under the SLC exam system. If the intention behind conducting the SEE for this year’s tenth graders is to identify students with weak academics, this goal will not be met, because nearly all students pass the SEE.\\nThe second point to consider is that school education for Nepal, as recommended by the School Sector Reform Plan (SSRP)and adopted by the government, is completed in Grade 12 (basic education is Grade 1-8, and high school is Grades 9-12).Therefore SEE is not a ‘school-leaving’ test that certifies a student’s capacity to move from the school to the college level. In the main, SEE is meant as a screening tool for students going from Grade 10 to Grade 11 within the same school. Its significance as a nationwide examination does not compare to that of the SLC that preceded it. Even that significance is diminished by the fact that next to everyone passes.\\nWhen we look at these facts, it becomes clear that for the past few years the government has been expending vast amounts of time, energy, and resources for something of very little consequence. While we should have studied the appropriateness of the SEE anyway, the COVID-19 crisis has forced us to sit up and take notice. Several individuals and institutions are now doing so, such as the Ganesh Man Singh Adhyayan Pratishthaan, which has recommended the cancellation of the SEE exams.\\nTo reiterate, under the current system, school-leaving is after the 12th grade, and there is little need for the National Examinations Board (NEB) to conduct SEE to simply ensure movement from Grade 10 to Grade 11.The NEBcan focus on holding the 12th grade examinations well and can do away with examinations in Grades 10 and 11. In the meantime, the government must start a public information campaign to ensure that there is full understanding among the public that Grade 12 – not Grade 10 – is the end point of school education. This should be done not merely as a recommendation to students, but as a declaration of what the current schooling system is.\\nTrust the schools\\n\\xa0The removal of the SEE is also an opportunity to have schools to do their own evaluation of students at the end of tenth grade. In the past, the government (as well as larger society) has been worried that letting schools conduct the examinations will result in cheating and this fear has necessitated the tremendous resources required for centrally administered examinations. Given that centralized examinations should now be reserved for Grade 12, there will be little lost – and a lot to be gained – by allowing schools, both public and private, to provide their own evaluations to students. This will be an opportunity for schools to engage in real teaching instead of merely teaching for the test.\\nThus, teachers would assess their students’ performances throughout the year to provide letter grades for their students: Distinctions, A’s, B’s, C’s, etcetera. This is an opportunity to make schools more accountable and honest in grading, because the grading will be meant for students who continue within the institutions themselves. Over time, those schools that are too lenient in their markings will be ‘found out’ when students finally graduate in Grade 12, hence there will be an incentive to provide authentic evaluation of students throughout the school years.\\nThe question may arise as to what can be done with students who study only until Grade 10. First, the government must try and ensure that henceforth all students end their schooling in Grade 12, because in terms of maturity as well as in terms of job prospects, to study until this grade is important. However, in the event that for whatever personal, financial or livelihood reason a student does end schooling in Grade 10, the National Examination Board must certify the grades provided by the individual schools. For these students, the government must also invest in vocational education.\\nSchools know their students best, and this will be an opportune moment for the ministry to work on the basis of trust and have them send the marks for the tenth-grade certificate.As they get used to the new system, schools will have the confidence to send authentic grades because they have taken care of these students over many years. The government can use a general guide based on schools’ exam records of the previous years in order to examine authenticity.\\nJust as the schools upgrade students from Grades 1 through 9 each year, they should be able to upgrade them from Grade 10 to 11. The practice of continuous assessment on a daily basis, if done well, will give teachers much better information on the students’overall strengths than a one-time final examination. It is, therefore, not advisable to give too much importance to the SEE.\\nConsider the situation in which a student leaving Grade 10 in one high school wants to enroll in another high school’s Grade 11. In such cases, the student will have to sit for the entrance examination of the school into which he/she is seeking admission.\\nProviding a better learning environment\\nIf schools are given the opportunity to evaluate their own students, they can evaluate them on a broad range of capacities. This will be a much more holistic evaluation than the present three-hour subject exam that tests primarily content rather than skills. It will encourage teachers to start taking their jobs more seriously and to provide individual oversight to each child, figuring out what they have leant and where they need further support. Students will learn to nurture a multitude of skills and interests rather than focusing on passing an examination. The present trend of cheating to pass the exams would be made redundant and each school would know the strengths of the students much better.\\nWith students and teachers both being asked to be honest about their work, we will be grooming citizens who are upright and honest about what they know and where they need help. The ministry, for its part, can make effective use of the National Assessment for Student Achievement (NASA) and Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) to gather information on how each school fares within the country, and how our student performance compares internationally. It can focus on providing training on how to empower teachers, school leaders, parents and students themselves on the importance of honest and sincere work.\\nIn conclusion, the ministry must take a serious look into the matter of the SEE. If the International Baccalaureate and the Cambridge International Examinations can do this for schools all over the world, Nepal can surely trust its own schools. All educators know that it is trust itself that inculcates honesty. This is the time to set an example and take bold decisions considering what benefits the students the most.\\xa0 This is, therefore, an opportunity to do away with the SEE not just for this year, but for good. This decision would be part of the long-haul campaign ahead of us to improve schooling in Nepal so that our children can have the bright future they deserve.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt is imperative that transportation enthusiasts take some time during the COVID-19 pandemic to rethink our normal way of imagining urban transportation system. In our society, the idea of travel being a derived demand has been consolidated by the crisis which has forced us to stay in. The recent works on maintenance of the roads is admirable but what the article premises on is the demand side and the externalities of transportation which involves human interaction.\\nWe perceive our transportation system as roads on which vehicles move along with humans interacting with the infrastructure and among themselves. What we see down there is traffic, sometimes easy and smooth, while at times horribly frustrating. However, what we experience on our roads is actually the result of our urban form that creates the need of travel and the choices we make in regards to our need of travel. The pertinent questions we ought to be looking for with regards to our transportation system are: WHY WE TRAVEL? HOW WE TRAVEL? And finally, WHEN WE TRAVEL?\\nDeeper inquiry into these questions will make us come up to the idea that the composition, variation and fluctuation of the traffic that our infrastructure has to cater is actually the externality of how we collectively respond to the questions above in our daily lives in accordance to our circumstances.\\nThis time of lockdown has provided us enough time to reflect on these ideas that transportation is not just roads but the way people interact or are induced to interact with it. Since, this is quite tricky, as each individual in a society varies in terms of choices, social and economic background, this area has not been adequately looked into. Trying to understand the answer to the aforementioned three questions would help us take interventions that could not only ameliorate the conditions of our traffic but make long-term changes to the pivot of our transportation system.\\nFor instance, Netherlands which is today known as the cycling capital of the world was moving toward car-based transportation in the 1950s and the 1960s but an oil crisis in 1973 helped them rethink that probably cars dominating the roads would not be in their best interest and they took steps that helped them orient their mobility around people while having a thriving economy.\\xa0 We can only imagine what the authorities might have had to go through while they were imagining the transportation system that was completely different to the trend of that period. Today, it is a great success story.\\nThe externalities of our traffic system like congestion, traffic crashes or pollution is something we would be happy to get rid of.\\xa0 Since the traffic that we see on the roads are actually externalities of our needs of travel and our choices, intervening on the traffic operations are essential but may not prove to be relevant in long-term planning. For instance, congestion which we often view as a problem of our infrastructure being unable to cope with the demand could have solutions in socio-cultural modifications pertaining to our work. The work from home concept, which many managers today are forced to resort to, could be considered as a new normal for a variety of jobs even after lockdowns are lifted. Comprehensive\\xa0 studies on employee-based demand management strategies for different working sectors could be conducted in the urban areas so as to flatten\\xa0 the office hours in such a way that the infrastructure that we have shall be able to cope with the demands. It is almost analogous to flattening the curve, as we speak in COVID-19 jargon, so that the traffic demand could be coped at all times of the day if we have to talk in contemporary terms. For instance, Safe and Sustainable Travel Nepal (SSTN) is an organization working on the research of various areas of transportation system and it provides weekends to its research interns on other days than on Saturdays.\\xa0 One recent practice that we have come up with that directly affects our transportation network is the change in school times that was implemented a couple of years ago. A change of even 15 minutes could significantly attenuate the peak demand.\\xa0\\xa0\\nAnother important area that is very important is the issue of equity. Has our transportation system today provided the ease of movement equally to people of different age groups,\\xa0 different socio-economic background or people who are differently abled? Our society though relatively young today, would start ageing and if we do not consider our senior citizens in our planning process today, this might force us to again rethink our transportation infrastructure later. By not planning our mobility for differently abled people, we would restrict their mobility which could directly impact their economic well-being.\\nAdditionally, one aspect that could directly affect the well-being of the people living in urban areas is their degree of mobility and how much they can gain from their degree of mobility. There is no doubt that there is no such thing as perfect equity and the alternative transportation system that we imagine might also not be perfectly equitable but it would not be an exaggeration to state that our current transportation system benefits those who own a private vehicle than those who do not. As a result, those who do not own a private vehicle are enticed toward owning one which takes us toward a vicious cycle of our infrastructure supply not being able to handle the demand over a period of time. Furthermore, the ones using motorbikes are at a much greater risk of crashes and a system that induces individuals to resort to such precarious choices pertaining to our travel needs is not something we should remain complacent about.\\nMoreover, having a spatial system that hurts the well-being of people who do not own a private mode of transportation is not what we should run after as a society. The current crisis also shows that changing the work culture and alleviating the need of travel unless absolutely necessary would heavily reduce our dependence on cars/motorbikes.\\xa0 Mass-transit is an excellent solution to provide economic mobility but various factors pertaining to its operation, specifically lack of reliability has kept in from being an attractive mode of travel in most urban areas. As a matter of fact, we as a society might be moving toward a stage where we consider having private automobiles as a representation of affluence, by default, and a stereotype of public transit as something for the poor. Former mayor of the Colombian city Bogota, Gustavo Petro, wisely reminds us that “A developed country is not a place where the poor have cars. Its where the rich use public transportation.”\\xa0\\nAny discussion on sustainable transportation will not result in strong outcome if it does not address the issue of urban form and vice-versa. As a matter of fact, our need of travel is largely determined by the arrangement of urban facilities.\\xa0 The study of transportation of the Kathmandu Valley performed by the Japan International Co-operation Agency in 2011 shows that the Kathmandu Valley has the highest population density within the Ring Road and this region also attracts people from outside the Ring Road for employment opportunities. A robust public transportation within the Ring Road with integration of policies like park and ride or park and walk would be helpful to people across all the sectors. However, with regards to the developing urban areas there could be other ways of imagining urban form as well. Establishment of urban facilities like good schools, hospitals, malls and work places in those areas would curtail the need of travel to regions that are already attracting a lot of commute. This could be another way of urban form that would induce a completely different form of urban mobility.\\xa0 It is important to note that every urban area is different in terms of its geography and the people living there and it would be in everyone’s interest to develop the urban form and our transportation system through participatory planning.\\nWe do not yet know the concrete contextual form of our mobility system for our urban areas but most of us would agree that it has to be sustainable, as equitable as possible and should incorporate technological progress within itself. Raising an issue on changing our perception of transportation is one task but it will take a lot more steps than just acting directly on transportation. It includes interventions on spatial processes, human behavior, policies and technological development. A journey of thousand miles begins with a single step, goes a popular Chinese saying, and the time for taking the step could be now.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nGovernments and people around the world now are fighting against the newest threat to humanity. As with other disasters and emergencies, COVID-19 has differential impact on people who are affected disproportionately based on various intersecting factors such as gender, geography and socioeconomic status.\\nStudents are among the hardest hit in the current pandemic. Many countries have imposed lockdowns causing schools and universities to remain closed. According to a UNESCO estimate, 1.7 billion students, or more than 90% of the world’s learners are forced to stay at home due to COVID-19 lockdowns across the globe. The government of Nepal enforced the nationwide lockdown starting March 24 further extending this until May 7. Schools and universities are closed and examinations are halted including Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) and grade 11 and 12 examinations. Over 35,000 schools are currently closed and over eight million students are staying at home. There is growing concern and confusion among teachers, parents and students over the future of education amidst the uncertainty resulting from the global pandemic.\\nEducational authorities are having rounds of discussions with educators and experts as to what should be the education modality to cope with the situation.\\xa0 Some private schools have already opted to go digital and operate online classes. This has triggered a debate among the expert community suggesting how to take advantage of this opportunity to utilize technological advancements and bring schools to students’ homes through computers, mobile phones, tabs and other media. But some experts indicate the detrimental impacts online schools may have on the pre-existing digital divide in the country.\\nThis decision by some of the private schools, although preparedness for online classes is questionable, has left parents particularly confused. Shanti Nepal who went back to her village with her sons in Kavre after the schools were closed, is now debating whether she should come back to Kathmandu, as her son’s school has decided to resume classes through online platforms. Other parents in her neighborhood were also notified by their children’s schools about online classes and some of them have returned to Kathmandu hiding in vegetable transporting vehicles disobeying the lockdown and risking the COVID-19 contagion. One man, who traveled back to Kathmandu with his family members hiding in a vegetable truck, shared that “I am worried that I may not be able to help my daughter as I lack knowledge and skills required to facilitate the online classes even though we have access to a computer and internet at home”.\\xa0\\nThis exemplifies that even the parents and students of those having access to resources in cities are not fully prepared for and are in a dilemma regarding online classes.\\xa0 The schools, teachers, parents and students of public schools in villages are in particularly difficult situations as many lack computers and internet. In light of insufficient preparation of educational stakeholders and a huge number of parents and students that do not possess resources required for digital education, the introduction of online classes may well worsen the digital divide.\\xa0 Educational inequalities between well-resourced and under-resourced schools that have pre-existed in our education systems are also exacerbated. This further creates inequalities in the society.\\nThe digital divide refers to the gap between people and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology, and those that don't or have restricted access. This technology can include telephones, televisions, personal computers and the internet. The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines a digital divide as “the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and online access and those who do not”. The digital divide typically exists between those in cities and those in rural areas; between the educated and the uneducated; between socioeconomic groups; and, between the developed and developing nations globally. Even among populations with some access to technology, the digital divide can exist in the form of performance of computers and devices and speed or reliability internet connections.\\nAccording to the 2011 National Census, only 7.28% of households owned a computer and as little as 3.33% had household internet connection. Ownership of radio, television and mobile phones stood at 50.82%, 36.45% and 64.63% respectively. The Nepal Media Landscape Survey carried out by Sharecast Initiative Nepal in 2018 illustrates that ownership of radio sets and mobile phones has increased to 59% and 98% respectively. Similarly, the survey shows that 72 percent of households in Nepal own a TV set and nearly 60 percent of people watch television every day. While the ownership of these household amenities has increased dramatically since 2011, the disparity in the distribution of these resources between urban and rural areas, and across classes is still high.\\nThe equipment and facilities online classes require surely are not affordable for many people even in the normal condition in countries like ours where 24.8% of the population is living under the poverty line, according to the Nepal Living Standards Survey 2010-11 considering people living under $1.25 per day poor. The purchasing power of many people in Nepal has been further reduced as many have lost their jobs due to the global pandemic and are finding it extremely difficult to provide for their families. Unavailability of the resources required for e-learning may leave out many children from the education system. Children out of school are most likely to be engaged in activities that are harmful to their social, physical and emotional development, e.g. become child laborers to help their parents financially.\\nSimilarly, online classes may have detrimental impact on the existing educational inequalities especially between the students of public and private schools. Out of 29,000 public schools in Nepal, only 13% are equipped with computer labs and internet facilities. On the other hand, going to the schools that are technologically equipped also does not guarantee that the students possess this equipment at home. Therefore, making online classes inclusive and accessible particularly to poor families and those living in rural areas is an uphill climb that the education system needs to make.\\nThinking constructively, the coronavirus crisis has also provided an unprecedented opportunity to redefine the education system. This calls for: 1) massive investment to increase access to a computer, internet and other equipment particularly among economically poor families; 2) carefully planned strategies in consultation with education experts and learning from the best practices around the globe; 3) well-coordinated context-specific efforts from education authorities and three tiers of government; 4) accessible and affordable services from telecommunication and internet service providers; 5) upgrading the technical know-how of teachers and incentivizing creativity and innovation; and 6) effective use of radio, television and telephones in distance learning.\\nApart from delivering lectures, assignments and curricular contents,\\xa0 e-learning classrooms and online platforms should be used more to help students to think critically, be creative, appreciate their surroundings and nature, learn life skills, provide psychosocial support and ensure mental well-being, and facilitate a smooth transition to “normal” schooling post-crisis.\\nThis time should be taken as an opportunity to decide the face of future learning.\\xa0 As the feeling of confusion dwells among education stakeholders, a new modality of education may easily get through and become familiar in a short time. Therefore, education authorities should introduce digital learning that will make sure that education does not have to wait until the pandemic is over. It will also ensure that students leap forward in different learning models which will bring them into a bigger pool of knowledge to survive in a digitalized world. In doing so, we need to ensure that the alternative modality of education will not amplify inequalities by putting under-resourced students at a greater disadvantage than those of wealthier families.\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nA recent infographic published by Kantipur showed that there were 192 suicides in the first 16 days of the coronavirus lockdown in Nepal. This is by far the highest cause of death during this period, while natural death is second with 88. These alarming numbers indicate the severity of mental health issues and suicide rates in Nepal. While most of the world believes in addressing mental health issues and has appropriate measures for their citizens who suffer from this, the situation in Nepal is just the opposite. Mental illness is a taboo here, and the victims are pushed to silently suffer by themselves. According to a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), Nepal sees 6,840 suicides annually, but insiders know the underlying issue is far greater than just the officially announced numbers.\\nThis hidden pandemic is an unfortunate last result of a progressive worsening of a person’s mental wellbeing. It starts with signals anyone can relate to such as mental fatigue due to unfulfilled expectations or ambitions, anxiety, and chronic emotional and physical stress. It also all starts with the victim as well as their family. Neither do the victims talk about their mental health issues nor are those around them adequately engaged with them either because of lack of understanding or \\xa0for fear of societal stigmatization. They are often anxious about opening up due to the fear of being misjudged. They don’t feel comfortable opening up and sink deeper into despair and seclusion.\\xa0Furthermore, their families might not be aware of the potential implications or consequences of living with a person with mental health issues. Even if they know this, they might not be able to take measures to help the victim because of public stigma, societal taboo, or simply lack of knowing how to respond. This dearth of communication and absence of support is the primary reason behind the worsening mental health of these individuals. This may build up to such an extent where they may commit suicide.\\nSeeking professional medical help is certainly a sensible decision to take for someone who is suffering mentally.\\xa0This usually means visiting a psychiatrist in a country like Nepal that lacks a strong system for mental health and has shortage of counselors and psychologists. At the clinic, they have a conversation where the patient tries to present the problems they are facing mentally, emotionally, and even physically (e.g. headache). The psychiatrist tries to make the best judgment on how to help the patient, which primarily means medications. Most of the patients that visit a psychiatrist, even in their first visit, just end up walking out with a prescription.\\n\\xa0\\nIf clinically approved medications were enough to help people get over mental illnesses, then why are there still so many suicide victims? The underlying reason is the lack of understanding, support and empathy that they are missing in their lives. Many of these people don’t have the intimate support of someone who could understand and empathize with what they are going through. That is why empathetic peer-to-peer communication is absolutely necessary to help people who are suffering mentally. We must develop an ecosystem of peer-to-peer communication, creating a supportive environment and community where people are comfortable to open up and talk with one another, sharing what they go through every day.\\xa0It is paramount to give support and encouragement to people who are showing the initial symptoms of mental health distress and to those who are already experiencing more severe stages of mental health deterioration. Such effort should be complementary, on case-by-case basis, to the need of more advanced, professional help either in the form of psychologist or for more serious cases, the clinical support of a psychiatric.\\nTo address this underlying issue, an online support group called Paaila was recently started to provide an easy-to-reach platform for anyone in need of mental health support. The mission of Paaila is to help people overcome their fears and encourage them to open up and seek help, and make people aware of the fact that feeling mentally unless, anxious, depressed or suicidal is not their fault at all. It is just an uncontrollable mental state that they are temporarily in. Platforms like Paaila give them compassionate and empathetic support, which many of them feel like they do not genuinely have.\\nIn order to win the mental health battle, it is going to be essential to break traditional taboos embedded in our society, by educating the families and the loved ones of those experiencing all the forms of mental disorder, from the mildest to the most severe forms of it. Effective use of social media and any other digital platforms can help create a much needed new understanding of what it means to live with a mental health problem. Having peers helping and supporting each other can be an effective way to start addressing a different pandemic, one that often goes unnoticed until you read a gloomy headline about a mentally ill or suicide victim.Obviously a country like Nepal needs to put in place a strong system that detects and not ostracizes, that counsels and not judges, a system that can heal and not just “cure” all those citizens with mental health related conditions. Ultimately, it is okay not to be okay because, as Paaila believes, we can all replace 'I' with 'We' and even 'Illness' can become 'Wellness.’\\n\\xa0\\n(Galimberti is the Co-Founder of ENGAGE, an NGO partnering with youths to promote social inclusion in Nepal.

       "  \"\\nSince the initial cases in Hubei of China, the number of confirmed Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases has grown rapidly and spread to countries across the world. And it is already declared a public \\xa0health emergency. As a result, many countries have taken several measures from mass testing, travel and border restrictions, to lockdowns in a bid to contain the virus. However, the risks and threats of the virus are still growing around the world.\\xa0\\nAs countries across the world go into lockdown, many developing countries in particular face several problems of rapid response to this pandemic because of limited resources and weak public health system. In the countries where the pandemic is steadily progressing, there are emerging challenges of ensuring timely testing, treatment and robust contact tracing.\\nMore worryingly, in most of the developing countries, many health workers do not have adequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE). Furthermore, there are limited hospital beds to accommodate the suspected and infected patients. Nonetheless,\\xa0many health workers have shown an incredible commitment to provide health care services all the times in such difficult circumstances. \\xa0\\nBecause of the increasing risks and spread of the pandemic, most of the central hospitals and laboratory facilities have mounting pressure for timely tests and treatment for all. Undoubtedly, the health systems in most countries would be obviously further overwhelmed to respond to the increasing needs for testing and treatment services. As a matter of fact, most of the hospitals and other health facilities do not have adequate testing and treatment facilities, and physical infrastructure.\\nIn response to increasing spread of the virus, the World Health Organization is playing an important role in coordinating the global response and it needs to continue further for rapid response. Moreover, it is also high time that the countries and donors harnessed the power of partnerships in the fight against this pandemic. More importantly, more investment is critically needed to recapitalize health and epidemiological systems in the countries where health care systems are still weak and fragmented.\\nOf course, the increasing threats of the virus has prompted many governments to introduce unprecedented measures to contain the pandemic. Some of the pragmatic hygiene measures include frequent hand-washing, sneezing or coughing practices, and the use of protective facemasks. However, people living in poor, overcrowded, urban areas are especially vulnerable because most of them do not have adequate water and basic sanitation. And they could not even self-isolate, and have limited access to essential health care services.\\nIt is good to note that the national governments and health authorities are periodically updating the situation of COVID -19 and calling all citizens to stay safe and in self-isolation. The widespread messages and global updates of the pandemic are also available in the social media.\\nThings looked different as the pandemic started to spread in Europe and the USA. According to Lancet, Asian countries, including China, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, have provided rapid and effective responses so far. This might be partly due to their recent experience with outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and the 2002–03 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.\\nDespite some concerted efforts of prevention, the pandemic is likely to cause large-scale loss of life and human suffering. It is a big public health crisis which will further jeopardize global health transition and health systems across the low and middle income countries. Unfortunately, despite government's commitments to universal health coverage, the inequalities in health status\\xa0 and unmet\\xa0 needs\\xa0 for health care still persist. In this context, one lingering question is: can the developing countries boost and optimize the capacity of health systems to respond to this pandemic? \\xa0\\nThere are still lack of trained health workers in most developing countries. During any public health emergency or pandemic, health workers have to face additional pressure to provide timely health care services for people who are most affected and vulnerable. One of the serious concerns is to protect the health of health workers. That is why, ensuring availability of adequate face masks and other essential protective\\xa0 equipment for all health workers is critical to avoid the risk of further infections.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe consequences of this pandemic on our lives and communities are understandably worse than ever. Therefore, containment and mitigation strategies are key public health interventions to minimize the adverse consequences of the pandemic across the world. As we continue to fight this pandemic, the existing efforts to contain the virus should be further intensified to boost the health care systems and stabilize the economies. Additionally, the government urgently needs to plan stronger and more coordinated multi-sector response to mitigate its wider socio-economic impacts on individuals, families and communities.\\nSince the global health is in transition, the first and foremost priority of the national governments \\xa0is to invest more on building resilient and sustainable systems for health. One of the important priorities for health systems confronted with the spread of the pandemic is to protect the health rights of all people. This is only possible if the rapid diagnosis, testing\\xa0 and\\xa0 appropriate\\xa0 health care\\xa0 services are\\xa0 readily\\xa0 accessible, available and affordable\\xa0 in\\xa0 a\\xa0 safe\\xa0 environment at all levels.\\nTo sum up, there are critical needs to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic across the world. Despite rapid population growth, increasing trends of migration and urbanization, there are still challenges and opportunities for achieving gains in health, particularly in the developing countries where poverty, gender inequality and poor health systems have been persistent over the decades. Therefore, a multi-pronged approach with strong containment and mitigation\\xa0 actions, is urgently needed to effectively tackle the pandemic..\\n\\xa0(Bhandari is senior doctoral research fellow in global health and health systems and can be reached at talk2jhabindra@gmail.com)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has completely engulfed the world. As of April 22, there have been over 2.5 million confirmed cases and almost 180,000 deaths worldwide with the United States now the epicenter of the crisis. The worldwide shutdowns necessary to contain the spread of the virus has been quite detrimental to the global economy. What is good for public health has been devastating for economies around the world. In the United States, about 17 million people, more than 10% of the labor force, filed for unemployment claims during the month of March. Canada shed more than one million jobs in March, which represents almost 5 per cent of country’s labor force. The statistics are unavailable for Nepal but if it were, it would be damning for the economy. Since there is no public provision for lost income in Nepal, there are no estimates to rely on to quantify the labor market effects of the economic shutdown.\\nGovernments and central banks globally have unleashed fiscal and monetary rescue packages to mitigate the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The US recently approved a massive $2.2 trillion fiscal stimulus package along with trillions of dollars of injection of liquidity through unprecedented lending facilities through the Federal Reserve. The EuroZone recently agreed on half-a- trillion euros worth of rescue package for coronavirus-battered economies and is also mulling over another 3.2 trillion euros worth of additional packages. In India, the Narendra Modi government announced a 1.2 trillion rupee stimulus plan, including direct cash transfers and food security. According to the International Monetary Fund, countries around the world have taken fiscal actions amounting to about US$ 8 trillion along with unprecedented monetary and liquidity measures to keep their economies afloat during the crisis. All in all, the countries around the world are throwing the kitchen sink at the problem. The goal is to have a “V-shaped” economic recovery (rapid upturn after recession) once we get the pandemic under control as opposed to a “U-shaped” (longer recession before recovery) or an “L-shaped” recovery (severe recession and never recovering to previous growth rate). Nepal did come up with its own relief measures last month, which included discounts on household utilities like electricity and internet as well as extension of utility payment deadlines, temporary tax relief for hardest-hit sectors, and an announcement of in-kind food provisions to be administered through the local bodies.\\nOne of the biggest concerns at the moment is how best to take care of the daily wage-earners. The government has been criticized heavily on delaying cash-transfers to daily wage earners, but it is encouraging to see the efforts from the local units in identifying the vulnerable groups and disbursing the funds. A lack of pre-existing data on them has certainly stalled the relief process, but we should use this opportunity to set up a national database for these groups by merging the data across the country. The government has requested them to register at their local bodies in order to get the benefits from the local government funds. But many workers are trapped in the city where they work making it inaccessible for them to those benefits when they need it the most.\\nAn inability to pay rent is another significant hurdle for the daily wage earners. It is not rational to ask the landlords to waive rental payments for their hardest-hit tenants, and the government has already seen a backlash toward that end. The frustration is natural because rental income comprises a significant share of income for many landlords, and they may be counting on this source of income to cover their mortgage payments. Rather, the federal government could authorize local units to distribute means-tested vouchers for rent that the hardest-hit tenants could use to pay their rental income for the next three to six months. These vouchers would either be redeemed online, at their banks, or from the local bodies. The benefits are two folds. First, landlords would continue to get their rental income. Second, the local bodies can bring the rental incomes into the formal economy thereby enabling them to tax these incomes in the future. This can be a win-win situation for the government in the long run because this will lure the existing landlords to register their rental income and hence, the government can tax them when the economy recovers to normal state. It is also equally important that local bodies maintain the data of the vulnerable groups identified for the aid program so that it can be used as a criterion for other welfare programs in the future.\\nThe relief measure is also silent on the issue of food security. The neighboring country is in complete shutdown for almost a month, and there is no end in sight soon. As the blockade a few years ago has laid bare the vulnerabilities of our economy, food crisis is not too far away. Farmers at home are having to waste milk, eggs, and other agricultural produce because of the imposed shutdowns. The government should step in and purchase these products to fill in the current void as well as redirect them in food banks and cold stores for use in the next few months. They are also unable to carry out their regular planting and harvesting. The government could also loosen up lockdown measures in the agricultural sector because planting and harvesting is time-sensitive. Losing a few weeks would mean losing the entire season’s yields.\\nThe coordination of fiscal and monetary policies is ever more important during these times. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken some steps toward that end. As per the NRB circular to banking and financial institutions dated 12/16/2075,\\xa0 the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) has been reduced to 3%, and the interest rate on the Standing Liquidity Facility (SLF) rate has been reduced from six to five percent. Banks have been directed to defer interest and principal payments on all types of loans for three months and to offer a 10% rebate on timely payments. In addition, the NRB has raised the cap on the refinance facility to Rs 60 billion. Furthermore, there is a provision relaxing short-term countercyclical buffers. The NRB is no longer requiring banks to build up the two percent countercyclical capital buffer that was due in July 2020.\\nCountercyclical buffers are requirements for banks to maintain a higher capital-to-asset ratio during periods of economic expansion when banks are making high volumes of loans. These are in place to ensure that banks remain solvent if the value of the assets decline rapidly.\\nAll of these steps are encouraging. However given the magnitude of the crisis we are in, the NRB should not shy away from taking some unprecedented steps. The NRB should consider further reductions in the SLF rate and CRR to inject more liquidity into the banking system. For example, the Reserve Bank of India exempted the CRR requirement for all retail loans back in February. We should consider doing the same here in Nepal and also relax other capital adequacy constraints for banks to unclog credit freezes in the economy.\\nThe NRB has also directed Banks and Financial Institutions (BFIs) to approve short-term loan application from tourism and travel industry within five days if they had good credit standing before the crisis. However, the biggest concern at the moment is that banks may be unwilling to lend to these hardest-hit businesses which were otherwise healthy before the crisis. In order to mitigate this risk, NRB could start a facility akin to the Main Street Facility that the Federal Reserve in the US started on April 9. Under this proposed facility, troubled businesses could access loans from commercial banks, and commercial banks would then be able to sell a big fraction of the newly originated loans to the NRB conditioning on the borrowers having maintained solid credit standing before the crisis. This will enable the banks to continue lending without having to worry too much about the downside risks from the hardest-hit sectors. The NRB would create a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) and the Ministry of Finance would make equity investment to cover losses on these investments. The SPV will stop purchasing these loans from the eligible lenders at a certain date in the future once economic conditions improve. The NRB can also launch a Primary Corporate Credit Facility to purchase newly issued corporate bonds to provide financing alternatives for corporations during these difficult and uncertain times to the extent that corporations would be willing to issue new debentures.\\nGiven the widespread slowdown of the global economy, remittance income is sure to fall in 2020 and possibly in 2021. This puts the foreign exchange reserve of the country\\xa0 in a very precarious position. As of mid-February,\\xa0 the foreign exchange reserves of the banking sector was only sufficient to cover the prospective merchandise imports of 9.7 months, and merchandise and services imports of 8.5 months according to the “Current Macroeconomic and Financial Situation of Nepal” report published by the central bank.\\xa0 Much has changed in the world stage with the pandemic since mid-February. The price of crude oil has seen a record low, thanks to the worldwide fall in demand for oil compounded by the price war between the Saudis and Russia. The Saudis and Russia have since reached a truce but that has yet to prop up the price due to the very low demand. The oil dependent economies in the Middle East will crater in economic activity. Even the comparatively diversified Middle-eastern economies such as Dubai with a huge tourism sector will see a dramatic reduction in tourists until a vaccine is developed. The NRB has already imposed a temporary ban on import of luxury goods, but it is important to identify essential items from non-essential ones early on so that we prevent the drainage of foreign exchange reserves and protect our balance of payments position.\\nThis crisis has clearly exposed the vulnerabilities of a remittance-driven economy such as ours. We should utilize this time thinking about how we can diversify our economy to improve resilience to different shocks.\\n(Dr. Narendra Regmi is Asst.

       "  '\\nForests can simply be understood as complex ecosystems which is critical for maintaining healthy and habitable biosphere. Similarly, Water is another such critical component of the biosphere that is essential for the survival of all life forms. Traditionally, we understand that where there is forest, there is water. But in recent times, research has shown that this traditional understanding of interaction between forest and water is influenced by long-standing beliefs regarding the role of forest in water cycle and it is not always supported by science.\\nVarious researchers have tried to explain the interaction between forest and water through years of empirical studies and they have come up with the following conclusions:\\n\\nIn a river basin, forest cover reduces the annual run-off compared to shorter vegetation. Dry season flow is likely to be reduced in forest catchments as tree roots extract water from deeper layers of soil.\\nSometimes forest facilitates ground water recharge which temporarily allows for even distribution of run-off thus increasing dry season flow (but reduced annual flow). However, most evidence suggest reduction in dry season flow after afforestation.\\nOnly in specific areas in the mountains, annual yields of water may increase because the forests intercept fog and cloud droplets.\\n\\nThis shows that availability of forest does not always support availability of water. Similar results were shown by a research in Nepal few years ago, which showed that pine forest has been one of the reasons for depleting natural streams and aquifers in the mid-hills of Nepal.\\nThe forest area of Nepal is largely managed under the five forest management regimes as defined by the forest Act, 2076. Among these management regimes, community forestry is the most adopted forestry practice and today community forests occupy 28.8% of the total forest area of Nepal (Pathak et al., 2017). In the 80s, the government of Nepal started a country-wide reforestation initiative to recover Nepal’s mid-hills from wide spread deforestation that occurred a decade earlier. After years of research done by the Nepal Australia Forestry Project, pine was chosen as the ideal species for reforestation because it was already native in the mid-hills and grows very fast. As a result, majority of the trees in community forests of Nepal are pine today. But few years ago, a research in Dhulikhel showed that on an average pine consumes 13.5 liters of water per day and larger trees consume up to 70-80 liters of water per day. Also, they are coniferous evergreen species which means they require water throughout the year. This has caused reports of depletion of natural water sources from several districts of Nepal.\\nBut the truth is there is not enough evidence to justify that pine is sole cause of depletion of water sources in the mid-hills of Nepal. Experts claim that because pine has very low utility in terms of fodder and fuelwood, it is less preferred by the local community that wants to replace it with species that are more suitable to their agricultural and household needs. Hence they report depletion of water sources due to pine trees. Also, there are natural pine forests in Nepal where water sources are flowing in a healthy manner. So, presence of pine does not necessarily cause depletion of water sources.\\nPerhaps, there are a number of other factors that may be playing a role in depleting the water sources in Nepal. Firstly, the management practices that are being adopted for managing forests are not focused toward maintaining ecological integrity of forest ecosystems. The scientific forest management system which is solely focused toward promoting growth and regeneration of timber species are being adopted in high altitude districts like Humla, Baitadi and Parbat, which will only degrade the ecosystem integrity further. This surely has a certain degree of impact on the availability of water in the natural springs. Another factor that is at play here is climate change. With disruption in weather patterns, erratic rainfalls have become common around the world. Some places experience concentrated rainfalls, whereas some places experience droughts. This may have also caused depletion of water in the natural streams and aquifers.\\nAll we can say for now is that more research needs to be done to understand the dynamics of relationship between forest and water. Government institutions like Forest Research and Training Center (FRTC) and other non-governmental institutions working in the field of forestry need to collaborate in long-term research projects to ascertain whether the depletion of water resources is being caused by pine or not. If pine is really causing depletion of water resources, they can be replaced with species such as chilaune or katus or others that are suitable to the local factors. Also, proper policies need to be designed and adopted at the provincial level to integrate forest and watershed management for sustainable utilization of Nepal’s natural resources. The ways to rejuvenate these natural springs and aquifers also need to be explored to maintain long-term availability of water in our rivers.\\n(The author is a BSc Forestry graduate from Institute of Forestry, Pokhara)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAs the coronavirus pandemic hit, the government issued a fiat ordering a stringent lockdown. The roads and sidewalks were emptied, the shops shuttered, and the phalanx of police guarded the junctions from casual strolling and nonessential driving. The scheduled programs, seminars, meetings and appointments were indefinitely deferred. People went cloistered inside the four walls of their homes or the rented rooms, listening to radios, watching televisions or mindlessly scrolling the algorithms. The opportunity to spend free time with the family members, after a long time, evolved as a response to the fear of a death-dealing virus presumably spreading in the public sphere. The home, which was in constant interaction with the public, and where it drew its essence from, gradually showed how it could turn sour from sweet from the harshness of its own sheer domesticity. In contradistinction to an initial assumption that lockdown would free us from the unfree labor conditions of the public working places, and we would be able to pass time by a relentless and reckless exploration of our hobbies, we soon started to pine for the same old routines. The social media provided avenues and practically advised on how we should approach our hobbies, which books we should pore over, which movies we should watch, and what DIYs we should get our hands on. The middle class cyberspace displayed accordingly its exploits--exotic, elaborate vittles and crafts, as an unintended affront to the precariats who were on the verge of hunger. As philosopher Theodor Adorno defines boredom in Free Time as “the function of [social] life which is lived under the compulsion to work, and under strict division of labor”, excitement flagged too soon, and boredom reigned in. The boredom, and the anxiety it brought, forced people to return back to the reified labor regime through computerized work-from-home mode, and to a compelling engagement in micro-discourses of the social networking sites with a fair degree of petulance and irascibility. Chaos, and the ineptitude of the authorities to take exact measures to curb the spread of the virus, spurred the gentrified protests of the urban youths whose age and vigor entails them to peregrinate over places pretty much like the virus itself. It seemed staying in and staying out of the houses for the longer periods were both menacing--only a delicately balanced shuttle between the two appeared to be salubrious. Objectively, the financialization of capital, and the neoliberal paradigm that can’t sustain savings for a few months, and is reluctant to provide “basic goods” during the crises even for the relief of indigent families, and subjectively, the associated aspiration of people to meet quantitatively set “productive” goals got disrupted by the lockdown. As days, weeks and months passed in the passivity of countless scrolls, we witnessed a surge in publicization of a form of face-to-face interaction in the social media--the zoom, first as an anodyne for boredom, and second as a compulsion for performance based work-plans.\\xa0\\xa0\\nEven though cognizant of the fact that there is cornucopia of video conferencing platforms on the internet, I first came to know about the specific brand and its service through the talk programs aired on YouTube, and saw how it sneaked into the individual private spaces of the guests, and diverged those images to the public. The zoom webinars, a portmanteau of web and seminar, soon became a vogue phrase of the professionals--sharing screenshots of combos in the social sites, and receiving applauds for the same. As the zoom screenshots grew profusely, I secretly wanted to get a role in one of those. Eventually, I participated in a handful of webinars with excitement until the point of time it seemed too trite.\\nI was first invited to zoom by a batch of senior sociologists to listen to a series of talks on the prefatory remarks on the effects of coronavirus pandemic. Sociologists, much like other academicians, are active in documenting social lives, churning out papers, and disseminating information through seminars as a ritual. Currently off from teaching duties, academicians must have felt nostalgic about the “real” seminars, and must have felt an urge to disseminate their “productive” works, from the research conducted from home, to their colleagues and the wider public through live telecasts on Facebook.\\xa0 As I opened the zoom for the very first time, it felt as if intruding in a Goffmanesque hall, reminiscent of the works of American sociologist Erving Goffman, where the participants precisely know how to coordinate a routine through a repertoire of behaviors. The men, all middle-aged, were greeting each other as if they were in a backstage of a seminar hall or during a recess until the clock struck when everybody toned down and silenced in ways to shift the ambiance to the front stage where only the formal talks are allowed. I had really put the room together, and had concealed the objects which were not allowed to the gaze of interlopers for a readiness to a situation if I had to open the video or accidentally did so. In quotidian seminars, academicians are generally called into a podium composite of table, pen, notepad and microphone where they give thoughts and give off expressions to the audience who are close to each other but socially distanced from the speaker. The metaphysical hierarchy is duly maintained. In zoom, however, participants are physically distanced, in the real sense, that they can even get a chance to get closer in a single frame. While the structure and props of regular seminars are institutionally fashioned, one has to cautiously “suppress” the pointless facts, and adjust the computer in a way that participants can see the professorial front of one’s space in an optimized angle, a rack of books, for example. It was of late that I came to know that zoom can obliterate your room altogether, and provide artificial backgrounds so that a person of certain status can feign one’s room according to the status and hobby--hackneyed bookrack concocted to a pair of oil-paintings or a guitar. Prior to knowing this specific feature, I was astonished by one participant who was going live from a pebbly seashore as the other sat in a baroque room. I don’t understand the degree of gratification one receives from these altered, synthetic backgrounds, but the technology has genuinely assisted to sequester the offstage into a working frontstage. While it is\\xa0merely a fib on the part of who feigns his or her background, it is redolent of the general direction of human nature toward the impression management.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe molecular details given off by the webinar participants, as they lecture on or listen to, specifically helps to glean information on the spaces which are often associated with traumas and anxieties, generally fenced off from the trait of confident forcefulness showcased in the public situations. Even though the entertaining but addictive social media has prompted public figures and academicians to post family photos and those of their fetishized possessions, as the camera zooms in, the face bulges out of the interior design and the architecture of the strictly private space. It is on the part of the audience to judge the aesthetics of a particular room whether it is spacious or crampy--to boast or regret is the duty of the speaker. The etiquettes and sartorial choices in the zoom webinars are either maintained as if the session had started at the midst of reading, writing or any of the “important” chores or as if one has been long preparing for the session which can be both casted as impressions projected toward the audience. Frustrating it may seem when the sound starts to crackle or the face goes blurry as the bandwidth decreases, a participant starts to talk on the phone or\\xa0is summoned by a family member, calling forth a giggle or a shout.\\nIn an academic system, everybody must be upbeat about the workings of the computer and information technology, and one should be able to process notes or prepare slides. As German philosopher Martin Heidegger states in “The Question Concerning Technology” that the “essence of technology is nothing technological”, the usage of the technology has been pragmatically employed in mundane scholarly activities far from being an end to itself. As the pandemic hit, the dependency to technology became more and more prominent and necessary for remote learning, for example. Technology, in broad, and the social sites, in particular, may have neutral features and objectives, yet they seem to strongly espouse, reinforce and circulate the unthought conservatism. One conspicuous example is of the manels of the web discussion series, where men boast of having specialized knowledge of a certain field, and end up passing the bromidic information. It is always the case for a discussion whenever its panel is homogenous, and the discussion is only more consequential if it incorporates diverse lived experiences and points of view. But, the real devil lies in the details--the social structure comes down to the molecular interactions -- micropolitics --of the social spaces. Academicians generally eschew the interactions altogether, and focus outwardly on the themes and structures which are themselves the consolidations of the interactions with which they themselves get involved. It is worth contemplating on the micro (mis)behaviors and conversational (dis)orders --littered with gaffes, aggressions, inequities--that gives keys to our social structure to which zoom becomes a rich ethnographic field.\\xa0\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nSome goodbyes are harder than others and then there are some which you never want to say. This is one of those for me.\\nSince the very beginning of the pandemic, I controlled my movements, specially the gatherings. I even gave up attending funerals of my relatives and family friends.\\nToday after many months of confining myself inside, I could not hold back and attended my very first teacher’s funeral.\\nWhen I reached Pashupati Aryaghat to bid her my final farewell, the funeral pier was already lit. I started seeing so many familiar faces from Birgunj and her family. Maybe because of the continuous rain for the past few days, the firewood was wet and the area was covered by dense smoke. Amidst the smoke I tried to picture her, the last image of her that I had in my mind perhaps. A face with a smile and eyes full of life.\\nEvery time I used to go to Birgunj and pass Himanchal Cabin, I tried to look who was sitting on the cash counter. If it was anyone else, I used to move on but if there was Mamta Ma’am sitting there, I would go and greet her. Lately she used to be busy with her social works including women empowerment so would not find her in that cash counter much. That was the reason why I wanted to go to the school with her. Never did I know that where I met her for the first time was going to be the place where we meet for the last time too.\\nPeople knew Mamta Rajkarnikar as an entrepreneur, a social worker, a gem of a person and for so many other generous engagements.\\nMamata Ma’am was a member of the famous Himanchal Cabin family. It was the first proper sweet house that my home town Birgunj had. Some 70 years ago her grandfather Padam Rajkarnikar moved to Birgunj from Lalitpur and they introduced a variety of sweets in the tiny but growing town of Madhesh. Being Rajkarnikars of Kathmandu Valley they had a long legacy of sweets business.\\nBut Mamata Ma’am was more than that for me. For me she was my first teacher, my first mentor and the person whom I adored and looked up to.\\nOn 1st March 2019, I went back to my first school, Creche International School, after 18 years. As soon as I entered the gate of the school, nostalgia hit me. All those memories went through my head one after another like an episode of some series. That tunnel slide, that monkey bar, that playground and those classrooms; everything was a part of my childhood. Mamta Ma’am was smiling as she looked at me recollecting all those memories. I shared some of my memories with her, how I used to hide in that tunnel of the slide and cry as I did not want to come to the school, that one time when there was a magic show in the school, that one time when my grandfather brought ice-cream for the whole school on my birthday, that one time there was this photo shoot, that one time I was kept in the office and made to do my homework, those one times kept on rolling for a while. I kept on talking as ever and she was smiling and listening to everything that I was saying as ever.\\nTo be honest, I was very scared of Mamta Ma’am when I was young. The reason behind it was my mother saying ‘I will tell Mamta Ma’am’ for every mistake that I made. Yet, as time passed by, I started to realize a lot of things and most importantly I realized that she is my first teacher and there is a special place for her in my life that no other teacher or mentor can ever have. Even after being principal and founder of Creche International School for 20 years, she was as cheerful and compassionate as ever. Her work ethics inspired me a lot. Talking about inspiration, there are a lot of things about Mamta Ma’am that had inspired me. Even the way how she bid her last farewell to all of us.\\nCOVID-19 hit Birgunj very hard, as it was the gateway that connects Nepal to India. The coronavirus took many lives in that city and now it includes Mamta Ma’am, to add to her brother and her mother. After the government lifted the first lockdown in Birgunj, Rajkarnikar family was infected with the novel virus. After that she, along with her family members, was brought to Kathmandu. She lost her younger brother first, followed by her mother. And now after battling for more than three months at the ICU supported by the ventilator, she gave up. Her lungs were damaged beyond repair by the virus.\\nI cannot even imagine myself in the ICU and ventilator for all that time. Fighting the COVID-19 along with my mother and brother, losing both of them as they could not make it and still have that fighting spirit to recover from the damage it did to the body. She indeed died a HERO.\\nYou may have left us but all your teachings, moral values and wisdom that you have passed down to us will keep you alive in every one of us. So, I am not going to say good bye to you Ma’am, I would rather like to thank you. Thank you for all those moral values and wisdom. Thank you for all the lessons of life that you have taught me. Thank you for being my first teacher. Thank you for listening to me so patiently. I could not have asked for a better first teacher than you. Thank you for everything Ma’am!\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWith increasing use of social media, the public communications disseminated by government authorities reach out to global readers. This means such communications have also come under unprecedented social media scrutiny. Social media users of Nepal have increasingly pinpointed typographical errors, generally referred to as typos, creeping into the public communications. Recently there have been several examples of negligence even on the part of academic institutions to live up to the writing standards and the objectives when it comes to typos. This article discusses consequences of some of the typos before summing up how typos in general also reflect the working environment in the public and academic offices, which is perceived to be getting laxer when it comes to compliance to writing contentions.\\xa0\\nThe typo littered communications most disapproved and made fun of by social media users quite recently are more than funny and embarrassing. A reader cannot help chuckling upon going through the public service advertisement (PSA) published in Nepali language in a newspaper against trafficking in persons. The PSA reads “trafficking in person is our duty and intent.” By the purpose of the PSA, the typo has a disastrous result. A public notice displayed in a Hindu temple premises reads “we are in underground of seesee camera” to inform the visitors that they are under CCTV surveillance. You cannot help laughing them off. Similarly, a statement issued by the Public Transportation Office apologizing for service interruption due to electricity mistypes with an embarrassing result. The word written to refer to “link” is mistyped as something that refers to phallus in Nepali language.\\nA newspaper publishes a news report that reads that a “hospital safely impregnated a woman who tested positive for COVID-19” instead of reporting that the “hospital safely delivered a baby of a woman who tested positive for COVID-19.\" When a ward office of the local government releases a public notice littered with boatload of random typos severely twisting the message meant to convey, it of course becomes a cause of concern. When an individual awaiting report of the PCR test for COVID-19 receives a report in which his/her age is mentioned as 999 years old, it simply winds up humorous at first but raises questions in the meantime on the reliability of the test result. These instances of typos make the readers end up disparaging the communications as they seemed to have been made public more due to slapdash working practice than other circumstances.\\nTo our great dismay, even academic practices are not devoid of typos. For instance, multiple occurrence of typos crept into the test paper of Nepali subject of grade 11 administered in June 2019. It had triggered a big concern that the paper seriously contravened the language convention by negatively affecting performance of students in the exam. In March 2019, students appearing in the Secondary Education Examination (SEE) got flustered as their test paper for Compulsory English was littered with errors. The Tribhuvan University was criticized for its negligence as its test papers of Bachelor’s degree on Creative English exam of 2018 were a sheer example of negligence-induced typos. The test papers were erroneous by punctuation marks, capitalization and also by multiple instances of factual inaccuracies.\\nA press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about Nepal’s head of the state’s message of sympathy and grief to Indonesian President Joko Widodo had a serious typo. The disastrous typo that occurred in the release--“Sent a message of congratulations” on “the loss of many lives”--caught social media users’ attention instantly and the ministry had to correct the press release urgently.\\nThis scribe had jointly conducted an intensive research in 2013 also with an objective to find out the status of typos in Nepal’s school textbooks. The study had reviewed a total of 55 textbooks of grades 6-10 published by the government and private publishers. The research report concluded that school textbooks were full of typos requiring due attention for revision and effective monitoring on quality control by the government authority concerned.\\nMore than being merely the howlers on themselves, typos are costly--the explosion of the rocket that launched American interplanetary probe Mariner 1 in 1962 just minutes after take-off due to a missing hyphen being the best example. Personally speaking, this scribe also lost Rs 400,000 a decade ago when a formal letter issued by the Office of Vice Chancellor of Tribhuvan University and undersigned by a professor was rejected by a government office of the United Kingdom on the ground that the letter contained a typographical error. The rejection letter said clearly that “even if” was typed in the letter instead of “although.”\\nWe fear now that quality control and compliance aspects of the public authorities have eroded over the years when it comes to disseminating written messages publically. Typos that creep into important messages basically due to carelessness not only reflect modus operandi of the institutions concerned but also pose questions on their quality control mechanism. Such erroneous communications indicate lax quality control practice on their part. Broadly, these point to the reality that our system has been gradually undermining the possibility to orient ourselves toward promoting perfectionist value of the society. Undoubtedly, negligence-induced typos have been attributive to further eroding public institutions’ credibility.\\nTypos generally are the result of carelessness. Failure to pause and check before hitting the ‘enter’ and ‘send’ buttons or total disregard to details is the problem. Content automation has not been a practice yet neither having the final drafts of communications reviewed by more than a pair of professional eyes. Typos on social media indicate that intellectual practice is failing among bureaucrats and politicians. Even the academic institutions are disregarding the core purpose of communicating.\\nNo one is infallible. Popular dictum has it that to err is human. Written texts with occasional typos are, therefore, bearable. Even the typo nerds disregard them. However, communications littered with multiple instances of typos are a big problem as they convey merely the half-formed thoughts failing to meet the purpose of messaging. They are reducible so can be detected and corrected before making important communications public. Modern typing devices do not fail as they are created to be more accurate and mechanical than humans. Typos occur because fingers fail but brain and honest efforts can correct them if a writer believes in the set standards and makes every effort to minimize them.\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIn his classic novel, The Plague, French writer Albert Camus reflects upon the untold deaths in Oran, an Algerian city where the epidemic occurs, as “a hundred million corpses broadcast through history are no more than a puff of smoke in the imagination.” “Since a dead man has no substance unless one has actually seen him dead,” he argues. By imagination, Camus implies the human faculty that throws events of the past into a real-imaginary interface. The want of personalization sets off humans apart from the events which are then waned into a sort of blur. However, it doesn’t entail a semantic abracadabra to deem imagination as a creative faculty with which one could grasp and express the melancholy or the ecstasy of the events with a brio, albeit the actual witness can still paint the more authentic portraits of the events. On the academic front, such an eloquent record of events can possibly be kept by the sociologists through what the American sociologist C Wright Mills called “sociological imagination” expounding the tricks of this trade in a book published in 1959. A “post-modern cowboy”, Mills heralded an aurora in sociology, a multi-disciplinary branch of social science, in the volatile 1960s through a publication that abruptly broke with the dominant pedagogies and practices, fearing such an intellectual prowess, his contemporaries, Seymour Lipset and Neil Smelser, had to warn the world in writing that the worth of his texts was close down to zilch. The reference to Mills’ “sociological imagination”, a treatise on the dialectics of private troubles and public issues, is evoked not as a text that has solely didactic purposes, but as a possible tool to reach the cruising altitude of the ongoing pandemic imagination. \\xa0 \\xa0\\nHaving started in Hubei province of China as a pneumonia outbreak in December 2019, the novel coronavirus has swiftly spread across the world with the death toll reaching almost a million. Had the Wuhan authorities discerned the handful of early cases as the presage of global health disaster, and contained the pathogen at its source, this virus would not have made such a dangerous expedition throughout Europe, Asia and Americas. This conjecture has galvanized the fresh discourses about the fault lines of the international political economy. Hordes of other discourses including the specious connection between climate change and pandemic, and the speculative rise of authoritarianism have found prominence. However, looking from an alternative, sociological angle, the botched effort to curb the spread of coronavirus, and the associated failure to save lives has become the debacle of the population state matured in the west in the second half of the 18th century.\\nAccording to scholar Michel Foucault, modern power of the population state has been brazenly “exercised on the level of species, the race and the large scale phenomena of population.” It was through the intersection of the rise in economic and military might, and the evolution of “welfare” in the second half of the 18th century which gave rise to “public health” that indexed the features of population through census, ordered mass surveillance and permanent control. The system of extractive, over-administered and panoptic regime, Foucault argues, has caused more holocausts, massacres and genocides in recent history than any time before. While it is quite early to assess which countries have triumphed in the fight against the pandemic through the technologies devised for public health and those appropriated for prosaic security acts, and which country will eventually win the biomedical rivalry by manufacturing the first effective vaccine, the explicit agenda of the population state to save lives from epidemic and endemic illnesses has failed deplorably. Foucault’s historical critique of the public health system is compelling as\\xa0it parallels Mills’ vision of converting (auto) biographical experiences to a public affair. Foucault, who battled with bouts of depression and a major suicide attempt due to a slew of insults he received for being “sadomasochistic, pervert and homosexual”, had delved into an array of historical details to explore the context of his own sexuality. Given the local context, the chance for sociologists to be the phenomenological witness to the pandemic, unlike frontline workers, is unwonted. Albeit it is neither imperative nor practical for sociologists to anchor every research in the lived experiences, a fair degree of empathy and reflexion is usually asked for.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe paucity of public health resources and the longstanding corruption has resulted in the serious mismanagement of prevention and control of the ongoing pandemic in Nepal. As the general public critiques the government for acting either by caprice or cupidity, Prime Minister (PM) KP Sharma Oli and his ministers respond by passing the most brutal of remarks and unforgivable gaffes. The context of the government’s ineptitude and the league of its intellectual redemptors is a reminder to sociologists not to collude with the powers that put serious impediment to the research of the threatening perils. As seen in rigorous sociology, scholars seek to absolve the existing powers from culpability through the machinations of abstractionism and empiricism--both censured by Mills--by putting overemphasis on abstract structures over the immediate actors, and keeping a much bigger pool of research subjects, represented by surveys, samples, graphs and percentages, thereby overlooking the bits and struggles of laypersons. If an alternative protocol produces heroes and villains, missing the structures altogether within which the actors perform, sociology has to make a creative shuttle between the two diametrically opposed frames of interpretation.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn his essay, “The Plight of the Individual in Modern Society”, Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung says that for each manifest case, there are at least ten latent cases which seldom get to the point of breaking out, and frequencies of those latent cases are never put on the statistics. It is more demanding for sociologists to detect and scrutinize the latent details than just to shake the manifest crumbs off the research table. In the local context of pandemic, even the quality and quantity of brief data offered by the government sources\\xa0 is bereft of analytical potential. Doing sociology in this context is comparable to metaphorical walking in the hot coals--arrayed by unbridled corruption, deficient and mismanaged public health system, casteist triage, multiple jeopardies, repeated incidents of suicide, rape and murder, and a battery of insidious problems. As reductionist discourses of neoliberalism and biomedicine are making copious reviews and rapid-fire forecasts of the pandemic, the sociologists have a burden to protract the critical examinations to the pre-existing conditions of our social, political and economic systems as the deaths are not solely linked to individual health histories but the overarching system that governs those individual bodies. If neoliberalism and biomedicine provide rather perceptible influences on sociologists through bureaucratic capitals, the unreflexive associations to parties, status groups and classes operate in a concealed routine. One example suffices to make a point of such an association. As I tried to interview people affected by the pandemic, every person who came to my contact was from the middle class. This middle-class lifeworld of sociologists brackets them from the latencies of pain imperceptibly submerged under the feet of their own. This attitude and behavior meets the upper hand when we get accustomed more to telephones and cyberspaces than to offline, commonplace spaces.\\nThe theme of a paper with a gist that social ruptures give ways to knowledge production, as presented by a prominent sociologist in a recent webinar, is apropos to the context of pandemic if that knowledge contributes to complement the long-awaiting social repair. If sociology is an answer to the convoluted questions of our social life, as signaled by Ulrich Beck in Politics in Risk Society, it needs to augment its imagination by dissociating it from ad hoc and reductionist discourses as well as by shrugging off too much of abstraction and empiricist fetishes.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nNepali theater industry’s struggle for stability has been an age-long affair. The uncertainty around its sustainability, chiefly due to the imbalance between its financing and revenue modality, has kept the commerce of the industry on shaky grounds. Worsening the case, the uncertainty after the COVID-19 pandemic has further risked the future of theater institutions and artists of the fraternity. In light of such predicament, and to outline a possible road ahead, around 20 theater practitioners gathered for a discussion at Shilpee Theater on August 1. Initiated by Theater Hub and hosted by Shilpee Theater, the session brought out personal reflections, insecurities and challenges faced by theater groups and artists, especially during the lockdown, and it also facilitated a brief discourse on the future and revival of the industry as a whole.\\xa0\\xa0\\nStruggling to survive\\nThe Nepali theater industry has been virtually shut down since early March following the government’s directives to restrict mass gatherings. With no shows happening for almost five months, and a complete shutdown in alternative income sources like theater training, academic teaching and social/community theater projects, artists have been stretched to the limit for basic survival. Freelance artists, who often are remunerated on project-by-project basis, are mostly bearing the brunt of this protracted halt. Theater groups are, on the other hand, hard-pressed due to the rising financial liabilities amid no business. Artistic Director at Shilpee Yubaraj Ghimire said that the drying up of the organization's savings and an unforeseeable future has raised concerns about the institution's survival. Up until now, his institution has been barely managing to pay the lease rent, cover the electricity bills and maintain kitchen supplies for all resident artists. The fear of paychecks, however, hasn’t been the only insecurity that performing artists are currently going through. Many even have been struggling with the creative drought that has befallen all. The need to refrain from human proximity and collective process of making art has taken its toll on all artists, creating a sense of self-doubt and exhaustion. Without the process of making plays, artists are also worried of the possible stiffness that can hit them once they return back to the stage.\\xa0\\nNo state support\\nMuch like its financial vulnerability, Nepali theater has also been bereft of guardianship from the state--a unanimous reflection made by attendees at Shilpee. Although the state’s negligence toward Nepali theater industry isn’t new, a complete tone-deaf demeanor during these desperate times has piqued all stage professionals. On June 25, the theater fraternity had submitted a nine-point demand to the Nepal Academy of Music and Drama (NAMUDA) mainly outlining the crisis for theaters, the absence of government policy and actionable plans, and the lack of budgetary support for theater groups and artists. But, much to the dismay of the fraternity, their formal submission hasn’t been acceded for over a month. So far, barring efforts from a few independent theaters and the Federation of Theater Organization Nepal (FETO), the authorities have initiated no notable relief mechanism. Beyond these myopic problems, the academy and the Ministry of Culture, who are often indulged in passing the buck, haven’t genuinely realized the contribution made by independent theater institutions to the overall art atmosphere of Nepal. The shortcomings of these responsible agencies are projected through the lackluster efforts seen in organizing impactful theater festivals, drafting policies, plans and databases for theater events and people, and providing national and international platforms to deserving candidates. It is the creative drive and continuous dedication of independent drama organizations that have helped the theater industry achieve cross-border success, both content and quality-wise, especially in the South Asian region. Last year, NAMUDA was allocated with a fiscal budget worth Rs 60 million, but it did not trickle down to substantial and noteworthy theater activities, and the primary contributors within the independent theater scene were untouched by the budget.\\xa0\\nUrgent needs\\nSpeaking at the event, actor and director Dilip Ranabhat accentuated the immediate need of institutionalizing the theater industry itself, which might embolden the bargaining capacity of thespians working in it. Similarly, Kedar Shrestha of Theater Mall\\xa0stressed on revisiting the strategic vision of Nepali theater altogether. Rather than aiming at imminent survival tactics, he said the industry could only steady its ship by making the government agencies and stakeholders concerned more responsible in creating a secure atmosphere for artists. The discourse, however, didn’t only focus on ways of resorting to the government. Theater practitioners brainstormed about possible short-term workshops, courses that could be facilitated under proper distancing and hygiene protocols. Components like playwriting, theater management and interactions on other topical issues could be an icebreaker to begin with. And once the lockdown eases and things get back to normal, staging plays under open air could be another viable option that theater artists can think of. Theater groups like Katha Ghera and Shilpee have already executed few outdoor performances so far, but it was mainly targeted toward putting pressure on the government. To do so more frequently, and for an orchestrated storytelling, theaters should be careful about managing the audience. Spacious amphitheaters located at Taragaon museum or the Dabali (open square platform) of Academy Hall can be considered as immediate venues. Finally, the need for an entrepreneurial mindset in theater was collectively realized by many. Theater scholar and writer Jeebesh Rayamajhi put forward an idea of establishing a fund for theater institutions, an arrangement that can help create a one-window fund generating facility, and bring the corporate world and I/NGOs closer to the theaters. The presence of such independent setup will help not only in smoothening the financing of the industry but also help make the scenario more professional and organized.\\xa0\\nOut of all things, the session was a catharsis to many artists; a forum to vent out frustrations, fears and concerns about the future. The positivity emanated by the collective presence will certainly give confidence in the pursuit of finding a silver lining for Nepali theater industry in the days to come.\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nArt is a powerful form of expression and is essential for the development of a vibrant culture and functioning of democratic societies. However, the recent controversy over Sophiya Thapa\\'s song, \"Aba ko Teej no brata please\" which translates to \"This Teej, no fasting please!\", raises concerns over the state of arts in Nepal; are our artistes making unfair use of artistic freedom or are we becoming intolerant toward ideas and arts?\\nThe Hindu Jagaran Manch, a Hindu religious organization, published a statement demanding the song be removed from Youtube, stating that it hurts the sentiments of Hindus. Since the release of song, Thapa has been facing severe online abuse, harassment and threats of assault and death. The threats have forced distributor Highlights Nepal to make the video private.\\nTeej is a festival celebrated by Hindu women worshiping lord Shiva; married women observe Teej for longevity and good health of their husband, and unmarried ones for an ideal husband. In Teej, women observe daylong fasting without drinking a single drop of water. Apart from spirituality and faith, Teej had its own social aspect, which allowed women to visit their maternal home, get a break from their monotonous life, have delicious food, express their joy and sorrow in songs and dance. However, with changing lifestyle, the way of observing Teej in urban areas has turned it to lavish partyin and celebrations.\\xa0\\nThe song by Thapa, goes on to say \"This Teej let\\'s not have any fasting or water of others feet; men and women both are equal.\" The song presents the idea that men and women both are equal and calls on women to boycott the practices which promote inequality. Teej has been used as a symbol, and she proposes to celebrate Teej by spreading happiness rather than fasting.\\xa0\\nThe Hindu Jagaran Manch vehemently objected, concerned over the message of the song, and alleged that it disrespects Hindu traditions pointing fasting is an integral part of Teej and its removal will limit its celebrations merely to partying and concerts.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nCelebrating festivals and observing fast is completely subject to one\\'s beliefs. No one should be forced to do or not do anything against one\\'s beliefs. There is a large group of women who don’t fast or celebrate Teej. A lot of women also find Teej to be a patriarchal tradition to enforce male supremacy and claims it promotes subservience to male masculinity.\\xa0\\xa0\\nApart from entertainment, arts also contribute to social debates, sometimes bringing counter-discourses and potential counterweights to existing power centers. The song by Thapa also puts an idea for social debate and countering potential existing power centers. The song is a remarkable blow against the unequal norms of society, of decorating, limiting, and subordinating women.\\nThe Hindu organization and public at large find the song objectionable, as it encroaches the culture and hurt their religious sentiments. However, there is polarization of opinions about the song. The critics call it blasphemous whereas, the supporters argue that the song aims to promote equality and should not be deleted. At the center, people appreciate the song, with the reservation that the singer should not have appealed to others to boycott fasting. She could have used a much better way to portray the message.\\nHowever, the feminists view the criticism of the song as patriarchal mindset of society. It is part of masculine moral policing, in the name of culture, religion, and morality, which has been a tool against women\\'s liberty. The recent sexist and humiliating comments about a girl wearing a backless top on a government motorcycle is also a blatant example of such misogynist attitude.\\xa0\\nNot to fast on Teej is a personal choice of the singer, which she is free to express in the form of a song. Being a Nepali citizen, she has fundamental rights under the Constitution to have an opinion and express them. The constitutionally protected right can be curtailed under certain grounds, but the song doesn\\'t affect the religious belief and social harmony in any ways as accused. Rather, it reflects the changing image of society.\\nThe song enjoys protection under freedom of speech as it doesn\\'t pose any imminent threat of lawlessness.\\nHaving said that, the same freedom of speech also grants people freedom to criticize her song and make counter opinions. But forcing her to delete the song, harassing and threatening for physical damage reflects the intolerance toward creative arts.\\nWhere are we heading?\\nAccording to The State of Artistic Freedom 2020, a report by Freemuse, an independent organization working for protection and promotion of Arts and artists, religion is the third major threat faced by artists throughout the world.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn Nepal as well, we have witnessed the violation of artistic freedom for the sake of protecting religious sentiments. The death threats to artist Manish Harijan for his painting \\'The rise of collaterals\\' by the World Hindu Federation and padlocking of the Siddhartha Gallery for exhibiting it, represent the intolerance of religious groups toward art.\\nI don\\'t believe that arts should be left free to humiliate religions and hurt religious sentiments and the law rightly provides reasonable restrictions to limit that. But intolerance is not appropriate, as it promotes the rise of fundamentalists. If things are offensive and blasphemous, it should be challenged in the court. Threatening, abusing and harassing artists do not provide a solution.\\nThe European Court of Human Rights in Handyside v. United Kingdom held that freedom of expression covers ideas that offend, shock or disturb. Therefore, rather than censoring such works, we should develop pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness.\\xa0\\nIntolerance suffocates arts. We, therefore, should promote healthy environment for arts to flourish and ideas to be exchanged freely. Freedom of expression is integral to modern democracy and should not be curtailed by misogynist attitudes and irrational religious fanaticism.\\xa0\\n(The author studies law & tweets: @SoorajRay) \\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nI was 13 when I first got noticeably bad vaginal burn on the fifth day of my period. When I shared this with my mom, she advised me to drink more water. Hydration did not work for me and this pain continued at the end of every period. I was in period poverty and had no expert to advise me what is happening and what should be done.\\nGrowing up, I experienced that intolerable burning in my vaginal area in almost all of my post periodic days which would last from a day to four-five days. It is not that I experienced it round the clock. I used to have mild pain which I would notice only if I focused on that area but there was another kind of pain. The second kind of pain would not come scheduled, and arrive sometimes while I was about to sleep, sometimes during the assembly line or during group meetings. If I was alone in a room, I used to murmur with closed eyes, lie down, put a cold water bottle above and try to find some relief but it's different when you are with someone. I used to feel that it has come but I could not show my feelings and had to pretend to be normal. Something like electric current used to pass from that area up to the heart covering sides of the stomach and little up toward the head.\\nHonestly, sometimes I used to feel major nerves in my torso during those episode of currents. I used to feel all the heat coming up and tears would fill my eyes instantly. My fingers would hold each other together in a fist. Sometimes they would automatically try to reach and push back that part as a reflex action but secondary thoughts ‘to be socially civilized’, used to stop my hands from reaching there. That anxiety would last for 30-40 seconds at peak, three-four times a day and would pass away. This little time used to be emotionally disturbing. I used to feel relief for some time after the burning attack and would forget about that for the next 25-26 days until the next period arrived.\\nTwo years back, while I was preparing to give sessions on menstrual hygiene to a group of school students, I first became familiar with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) which includes mood swings, headache, heaviness etc. just before having a period. Getting to know PMS, I searched for post-menstrual syndrome as well expecting to read something similar to my issue but surprisingly there was nothing related to post-menstrual things.\\xa0 When I told my colleague about not finding it, I got to know that it was only me who was having those syndromes. All those years I was assuming that every woman experiences the thing I was experiencing. That afternoon, for the first time I searched for different reasons for vaginal burn. There, for the first time I read about polycystic ovary syndrome (or polycystic ovarian syndrome – PCOS).\\nPCOS \\xa0is a complex hormonal condition. ‘Polycystic’ literally translates as ‘many cysts’. This refers to the many partially formed follicles on the ovaries, which each contain an egg. The ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs leading to offer secondary side effects ranging from issues on regular menstrual cycle to prolonged diabetics and hormonal depression with suicidal thoughts.\\nMany of my symptoms including not being able to lose fat in certain regions of the body, having masculine physical character, irregular periods and vaginal pain matched with the symptoms of PCOS and I decided to visit a gynecologist as soon as possible.\\xa0 My first ultrasound made my doubt come true.\\nEven though PCOS is considered a gynecological problem, it consists of 28 clinical symptoms. Women with PCOS produce higher-than-normal amounts of male hormones (androgens). The imbalance in one major hormone causes imbalance all over the body including imbalance in level of insulin leading to obesity and diabetes, imbalance in thyroid hormones leading to loss of hairs and the reduction on the level of dopamine (stress reducing hormone) could lead you to be drowned into periodic depressions. Besides this, hair loss and excessive hair growth, irregular periods, periods on long intervals, acne and easier weight gain or difficulty to lose weight are some other frequent symptoms.\\xa0\\nThis hormone imbalance causes women to skip menstrual periods and makes it harder for them to get pregnant. According to the data generated by Fertility Center Nepal, 40% of infertility and abortion in women are due to some effects of PCOS. It has been shown that out of 100 women at least three and up to 26 women would be a victim of this syndrome.\\nResearchers haven’t been able to determine what exactly causes severe symptoms of PCOS, but they suspect that it may be a combination of genes and environment. Also, it might be different for different people. Some doctors believe that high levels of male hormones prevent the ovaries from producing hormones and making eggs normally. Rise in the cases of PCOS nowadays has been assumed to be due to the lavish lifestyle we all are living although most cases come genetically.\\xa0\\nPCOS do not have a fixed cure. Since this affects for a long time, doctors recommend some medications throughout your life and advice to never stay dehydrated, never gain weight or reduce it if you’ve gained, do regular physical exercises (including some specific exercises) and have a healthier diet. The body mass index should never shoot above 25. Some severe cases might get medicines to normalize hormones and to regulate periods. Women who want to get pregnant might have to go through some process of surgery and more medicines.\\nIn my case, my major problem was periodic and unscheduled vaginal burn. I didn’t have obesity, extra growth of body hair or any dangerous mental problems. The doctor told me that my cause is genetic. After taking medicines for six months, my periods are now regular and not that hard as before, I still get a burning sensation but it is less frequent and isn’t like that before I started medication. My body looks more feminine nowadays. PCOS was responsible for many of my personal problems but I have finally come to be familiar with my own emotion and my own body. All kinds of emotions we get like being happy, being sad, being angry, being fearful etc. is the result of the activities of our hormones. Our emotional health contributes to our mental health. With primary cause being PCOS, you have a chance to get secondary problems of emotional and mental health issues and these secondary problems can lead you to tertiary problems.\\nIt still might take another year or two to claim that I no longer have any gynecological problem. The change in me might not be just because of medicines but because of my efforts to eat healthy and exercise. I tried boosting estrogen (female hormone) level by taking an egg and drinking one glass of milk every day. Adding soy diet would be helpful if you are a vegan as these three foods are reported to induce your level of female hormones.\\xa0\\nMany girls out there have problems with vaginal burn but of normal kind. Dehydration and use of gelled pad are the major cause for this problem and they can easily avoid this pain.\\nIf you are among those who get this syndrome genetically, you might have already learned to deal with it. Never lose your hope to get a healthier body. There are cases where PCOS has disappeared completely by medication. For those who have got symptoms as mentioned above but are still medically undiagnosed, I recommend you to visit a doctor as soon as possible as the longer you wait, the more complicated your problem will get. For those who haven’t got any form of PCOS or gynecological problem yet, don’t take a single risk to get it. Exercise, stay hydrated all the time, always choose a healthier diet and most of all, although you would love eating paanipuri, chatpate and spicy pickles: stop eating all forms of spicy things. Why?\\nHere’s a simple explanation to this. Our body is a combination of chemical things. What we eat is also a combination of chemicals. Our hormones are chemicals as well. Spicy junk foods contain unhealthy chemicals which when inside our body, changes the normal level of our hormones and those hormones might change our whole body. If you don't believe this, try remembering how you get so energized after eating paanipuri and have pimples the next day.\\nI misunderstood many of my symptoms such as not being able to lose my belly fat, my masculine look and depressions as something else. Just a few days back, while having an online session on PCOS I got to know that the reason for my eyebrow and eyelash loss is also linked with hormonal disturbance which happened because of PCOs.\\nIt’s not pleasant to know that your own hormones could lead you to something big like depression without other mental and social issues. It is not nice to know that you are born with something that will make many your days worse. Being a woman, we already have to deal with a lot of secondary problems. If we let our genital health come in between, our life would be more difficult. This is reason enough for every woman to be cautious about one's health. PCOS-like disorders aren’t something to take lightly. In this period of lockdown, when most of us out there are on course of gaining weight, I request you to go and search on how obesity affects your genital health. Maybe this will make you start exercising and sweating regularly. Exercise should not be done just to maintain your figure but also to have a healthy body.\\xa0\\nStay safe, stay healthy.\\nSay no to any form of genital disorders.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nOn June 18, when Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli was busy trivializing COVID-19 deaths, a 16-year-old-boy living in an ill-managed local quarantine center in Dhanusha, was battling against severe diarrhea. Untended and untreated when most needed, Raju Sada later succumbed to the illness on June 22 after being moved to the isolation ward of Janakpur Provincial Hospital. The graphic visuals of Sada shuddering in pain was not only disheartening and excruciating to watch but also utterly frustrating and indignant, and could make anyone feel nauseated toward the system that has dragged the nation into a mess.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe government’s failure in handling the pandemic needs neither any exposure nor elaboration. But, more than that, it is the unabashed apathy and tone-deaf attitude of the premiership at the helm that has rubbed salt in the wound. PM Oli’s chest-thumping assertions and rhetoric have so far only produced sound but no soul. In times of such crisis, and especially when people are desperately looking up to him for reassurance, Oli has failed to feel the pulse of the nation. The absence of a humane, sensitive and logical attribute in the prime minister just goes to prove that he seriously lacks emotional intelligence.\\xa0\\nEmotional Intelligence, a psychological attribute propounded by the American psychologist duo Peter Salovey and John Mayer, primarily focuses on the comprehensive understanding of self and others’ emotions and using it as a knowledge base to better handle communications and relationships. The contemporary theory of emotional intelligence--which is further classified into five different skill sets like self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and social relationship skills--has recently been gaining traction in areas of organizational and political leadership.\\nThe first dimension of emotional intelligence, self-awareness, stresses on the importance of introspection, a rare phenomenon seen in PM Oli’s recent demeanor. In the past few months, the only time he has been visibly introspective, and has confessed his realization, was when he revoked the ordinance to amend the Political Party Act, that too after facing a lot of flak from the opposition and people within his own party. While explaining the intricacies of emotional intelligence, Mayer has also rejected an often-discerned fallacy related to it: high self-confidence equates to high emotional intelligence. Therefore, Oli, with his assertions and conceit, could still be considered as an authoritative chief but not necessarily an emotionally intelligent leader. The larger-than-life persona that he has created, and its ensuing vainglory, has stopped Oli from becoming more rooted and relatable to the commoners.\\xa0\\nOli also needs to understand the stake and sensitivity that comes with the role that he has undertaken. This will help him self-regulate his emotions better and be less impulsive in public presentations. The countless futile jabs and mockeries that he has made during recent times have made people see an insecure and irate person underneath the fierce orator. When fellow parliamentarian Gagan Thapa raised a pertinent question regarding Oli’s false claims about the immunity of Nepalis, Oli’s rebuttal was simply heedless and irresponsible. It shows how defensive he has been getting with any sort of criticism. To hone this much-needed self-regulatory skill, Oli needs to suspend his immature judgments and be more pragmatic and placid while making claims that have national and international ramifications. Had he been more humble and tactful, people would have been more tolerant with his dealings.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe discrepancy between Oli’s preaching and practices has also raised many people\\'s eyebrows. The way he has been defending controversial and dubious proceedings and persons has raised an alarm regarding his motivation, which, according to him, has always remained unpolluted and selfless. But unless he finds a tangible way to transfer his perceptions to people outside, he cannot stimulate others’ motivation. To achieve that, he has to pay heed to the ongoing hunger strike by youths, be vocal and intolerant of malfeasance and fraudulence, and engage more with strategic units to revive the nation from this fallout. As New Zealand’s PM Jacinda Ardern says, \"The true measure of leadership is the ability to confront the anxiety of people of their time.\" Our PM needs to do exactly that.\\xa0\\nOli can learn more from Ardern, especially from her approach in being exceptionally empathetic as a nation’s figurehead. Through her active participation in gay pride parades, standing in unison with families of terror victims, and her recent handling of COVID-19, Ardern has been exemplifying the true spirit of being a people’s leader. Sadly, such tenderness and comfort has been lacking in our case. Instead, we’ve seen Oli underplay migrants’ pathos, trivialize the gravity of the coronavirus symptoms, and indulge in blaming the media and other stakeholders. As someone who has participated in several freedom movements in the past, Oli’s ability to connect with the mass should have been spot on, but his sharp departure from a free and inclusive ideology has left everyone feeling alienated.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOli’s ability to manage relationships has taken a severe hit as a corollary of his emotional intelligence deficiency. Be it within his political clique, with his nationals, or with the neighbors, Oli’s lack of emotional intelligence has been straining all relationships, jeopardizing the nation’s future. Many, in the past, have praised Oli’s stance on issues relating to nationalism and international ties. However, taking his singular definition of nationalism and overdoing it, laced with absent-minded retorts, will surely sour ties with the immediate neighbors.\\xa0\\nAs rifts and dissonances continue by the day, it is difficult to tell whether it is already too late for Oli to reconcile his wrongdoings, but, for whatever time he remains the head of the government, he has no other choice than to be cognizant of his emotional intelligence,\\xa0and let go of his stubborn hunger to become popular.\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWith fear and uncertainty in every sector from economy to health, the only thing that could provide us assurance is vaccine. The only hope is for a vaccine to combat this pandemic and make our lives normal once again. With promising results of trials around the world, vaccine nationalism is on the rise. Currently, there are more than 135 vaccines in preclinical trials, 18 in phase I, 12 in phase II, four in phase III and one vaccine approved for limited use. Almost all of them are developed by wealthier countries or those with a huge economy.\\nAccording to the Merriam Webster dictionary, nationalism refers to loyalty and devotion to a nation, which tends to imply the placing of that nation above others. But nationalism has taken a dangerous turn, and we see more of ultranationalism these days\\xa0 “My nation first” approach is what leads to vaccine nationalism. It occurs when a country manages to secure doses of vaccine for its own citizens or residents before they are made available to other countries. This is achieved when the government of a particular country signs a prior agreement with a vaccine manufacturer. This will especially hurt developing and underdeveloped nations like ours in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.\\nGlobal problems require global solutions. In the midst of a pandemic we need science not politics for global strategy to allocate, distribute and verify the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines but it’s politics that accentuates vaccine nationalism and leads to disruption of global supply chain.\\nA few worrying statements have been made amidst promising vaccine trials around the world recently.\\nThe chief executive of the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest producer of vaccine doses, said most of its vaccine, at least initially, would have to go to his countrymen before it goes abroad.\\nEuropean nations, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Wellcome Trust committed over $8 billion to finance Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) dedicated to rapid deployment of new COVID-19-related health technologies. Yet the United States, Russia, and India have chosen not to participate in this initiative.\\nAstraZeneca reported that due to the UK’s $79 million investment, the first 30 million doses of the vaccine it is developing, with the University of Oxford would be allocated to the country. Then, on May 21, the United States pledged as much as $1.2 billion to the company in order to obtain at least 300 million doses, with the first to be delivered as early as October. The pledge to AstraZeneca is part of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed for securing vaccines for Americans as early as possible.\\nThe history of vaccine nationalism goes back to 2009 when H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic killed an estimated 284,000 people across the world. Some of the wealthiest nations like the USA secured a pre-purchase agreement with potential vaccine manufacturers. During those times, maximum doses that could be produced globally were 2 billion but the USA alone negotiated to buy 600,000 doses. It was only when the pandemic began to unwind and demand for a vaccine dropped that the developed countries offered to donate vaccine to poorer countries.\\nNationalism cannot go hand in hand with global public health principles. There are no international regulatory bodies or law that govern the pre-purchase agreements like those mentioned above. With the rise of Donald Trump in the USA, Boris Johnson in the UK, Narendra Modi in India and many more elsewhere, the wave of ultranationalism has been spreading in an exponential manner. With such ultranationalist behavior it may be very difficult for us to halt this pandemic.\\nEven if any vaccine is developed for COVID-19, it will take more than a year to reach countries like Nepal, if politics dominates science. With vaccine nationalism along with lack of global strategy and evidence-based global supply chain, we may never contain this virus.\\nI was always taught nationalism in perspective of isolation and alienation from other nations. It was only when I read Yuval Noah Harari that my concept of nationalism changed and I got a different perspective. The concept of nationalism never accounts as an isolation or separation from one another. The concepts actually originated for bigger cooperation. For instance; the river Nile was lifeblood for ancient tribes that lived along the river. It irrigated their fields and supported their livelihood. It was an unpredictable ally. With too little rain—people starved to death; too much rain—and the river overflowed its banks and destroyed the entire village. No tribe could solve these problems by themselves, because each controlled a small section of the river and had small number of laborers. Only through the collective efforts of all the tribes they could build huge dams and hundreds of kilometers of canal, and could hope to restrain and harness the mighty river. Thus, these small tribes coalesced and formed a nation and developed a feeling of nationality using various national emblems, songs, culture, et cetera.\\nSo, we must make our global governing bodies like the WHO, the Global Fund, the CEPI and GAVI stronger so that evidence-based approaches can be inculcated to halt the pandemic. We should use nationalism for the greater goods of others, rather than changing it into jingoist ultranationalism. We must remember that it’s the virus which is our foe. With global governance and evidence-based approach, we can stop transmission of virus and protect the vulnerable groups, no matter where they live. The pandemic can be halted only through timely, equitable and global access of vaccine. It’s global solidarity and global cooperation, which can help us eliminate this pandemic. It will be an arduous job but it can be completed if ultranationalist behaviors are kept at bay.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nJay is a friend. He’s been married to Jia for the past 25 years. They have two beautiful school-going children.\\xa0\\xa0Jia’s mother has few underlying health issues, so she lives with them as well.\\xa0\\xa0Jay is a caring father, a loving husband, and a compassionate son-in-law. He is a good man in every sense of the word.\\nAbout a week ago, Jay’s brother, who lives four hours away, extended an invitation to spend a weekend on a golf retreat. These brothers usually meet about three times a year and all they do is play golf.\\xa0\\nThe plan sounded great, except that this time it was different. Jay’s brother, within the past few weeks, had tested positive for COVID-19. Fortunately, he’d recuperated and had tested negative at the time when Jay was invited.\\nMeanwhile, Jia was a little nervous about this invitation and wanted him not to go. She was concerned that he was visiting a home that was already infected and she feared he could potentially, somehow, contract the virus, even though it sounded rationally safe at the point. Notably, she feared for her mother who has underlying health issues and could be the victim if this hell broke loose.\\nJay called me and asked if he should go putt those balls, or in contrast, listen to his wife and avoid potential suffering for his family by staying put at home. I pondered about the impasse and realized this wasn’t about golf or mother-in-law, to begin with. His challenge was way deeper than what was presented\\xa0prima facie. There was a moral choice that had to be made and he would have to make that without the benefit of a past experience. This was a place where he would have to tread along blindfolded with absolutely no contour or cane.\\nIncidentally, this isn’t an isolated happenstance.\\xa0\\nWe also have found ourselves, where Jay finds himself in this narrative, oftentimes totally torn between two or more glaring choices with no reference point to hinge on.\\xa0\\nThere are ideas, and they often meet at the crossroads. Only one gets to linearly move on toward the logical space in the future and has a life of its own while the others are left behind. When this happens, we bequeath our approval to just one course that caters either to our reasons or to our feelings.\\xa0\\nHow Jean-Paul Sartre sees this state of affairs in ‘Existentialism is a Humanism’ is explained in a story of a young man who finds torn between going to England to join the Free French Forces to defeat the Germans or staying near his old mother and helping her live the rest of her life in peace. He realizes his mother lives only for him and that his disappearance or his death would give her sadness since there’s no one else in her life. On the other hand, joining the French Forces would give him a sense of purpose where he could contribute for the greater good by defeating the Nazis, while in the passing, he could also deliver retribution for his brother’s death.\\nSartre thinks of such a moment, where choosing dwindles, reason relapses and action stops cold midway, as the moment where human predicament thrives the most. What could help this young lad choose? Which of those two choices is the more useful aim in the absence of omniscience? Let’s delve a little.\\nMax Horkheimer in his ‘Eclipse of Reason’ argues how human reason is replete with untenable undergirds and is there only to regulate our preferences and our relationships with other human beings and nature. ‘Reason’ as an organ for perceiving and determining the guiding principles of our lives has come to be regarded as outdated. In other words, reason for our choice has become synonymous with metaphysics, and metaphysics with mythology and superstition.\\xa0\\nOur reasons, our values, what they deliver to us are uncertainties because they upsurge in randomness depending on what pool of thoughts and heuristics are available at that moment of such deliverance.\\nFinally, this brings us down to the other resort, our last one.\\nPerhaps, ‘reason’ isn’t what we should cater to then. It’s not a tool sufficiently endowed to tell us how we ought to reason our way into an unknown realm. Instead, maybe we should move forward with our instinctual feelings. Something that makes us feel good, self-righteous, and where the heart eventually finds its peace.\\nAmong many others, Yuval Harari explains this phenomenon in “Homo Deus’ as humanism.\\nIn the absence of an external paradigm that can assign meanings to our undertakings, we have begun to selfishly consult ourselves about how we feel about what we do. Thusly, what feels good is good, and what feels bad is bad. And if an action does not cause anyone to feel bad, there’s nothing wrong with it. That which thrills us gets blessed and that which does not gets cursed. In ethics, the humanist motto is if it feels good do it. In aesthetics, humanism says that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and human feelings are the ultimate source of all meanings and authority.\\nComing back to Jay, I do not know which way the choice will take him.\\nAll I can see is how helplessly crippled he is within his human limits.\\nHe could either reason himself into staying home and potentially mitigate the sufferings for his family or he could intuit his way to that golf course and putt away some balls and feel fulfilled about his undertakings. That choice is for him to make.\\nFor me though, a moment like this would go remiss if I didn’t invoke what Ludwig Wittgenstein wanted all to know toward the end of Tractatus. And I (mis)quote him “Whereof one cannot choose, thereof one must hang on.”\\n\\xa0Unfortunately for Jay, hanging on isn’t a choice.\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nLiving a healthy lifestyle has always fascinated me. I had been trying to include exercise, yoga, meditation, healthy food, and diet in my routine but the many distractions in my life and my chronic lack of commitment weren’t allowing me to do so. The COVID-19 Lockdown came as a great opportunity for me to set my commitments right.\\nAlthough the lockdown in Nepal started from March 23, we closed our office from March 20 and posted ‘working from home’ on our promotional site. The volume of work decreased significantly. So, I felt freer to focus on my quest for a healthier lifestyle. I began with a very humble thing adding shower to my morning routine. I used to be very lazy when it came to grooming myself. Since I learned about the many benefits of cold showers including reduced stress, anxiety, and depression and boost in energy and immunity, I have been taking a cold shower every morning.\\nI also started brisk evening walks doing rounds on my rooftop for about 45 minutes with some stretching and pushups in between. After the exercise, I would lie down and stargaze for 15 minutes, meditate, and try to ‘connect to the universe’. I also started consuming herbal tea - ginger, fresh rosemary, oregano, and mint and sometimes turmeric water. My family, including my parents, replaced the usual white rice with brown. We used to believe that brown rice is expensive but we found out there are cheaper and tastier varieties of brown rice in the market with price range comparable to that of the regular white rice.\\nI had first heard about intermittent fasting six months before the lockdown from a friend who used to practice it. While we ate grilled cheese sandwich with bacon, he used to sip at coffee without sugar. I also came across an interview of a popular Nepali actress practicing intermittent fasting and heard about it from many others. So, I googled it and found the theory very interesting. Actually, fasting is a part of the major traditions and religions everywhere. Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and Christians from around the world have been practicing it for millennia. With modernization of diet patterns, fasting was increasingly cast aside as something rooted in blind faith. Then in 2016, Yoshinori Ohsumi, a Japanese cell biologist was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of autophagy, a process that degrades and recycles cellular components. In other words, autophagy is a process of ‘self-eating’, in which our body ‘eats’ its own old/dead cells, and recycles and renews itself.\\nA new health trend followed his discovery. It was called intermittent fasting. Many people around the world and some in Nepal have been practicing it. Going with the trend, I and my parents also started practicing it. There are three ways of practicing intermittent fasting. Our practice follows the ‘16:8’ rule. We fast for 16 hours from 9 pm in the evening till 1 pm the next afternoon. After that, we allow ourselves to eat. During our fasts, we drink only water and herbal tea without sugar and milk; even lemon water is not allowed. Since my parents are taking regular medicines, I made them consult the doctor before deciding to continue with the practice. My father had to stop it but my mother can continue and she has been reaping some visible benefits from it in terms of health and happiness.\\nThough most people seem to be aware about its weight-loss benefits, there are many other health benefits of fasting. Our evolutionary past tells us that as hunter-gatherers, we had to go for hours and days without food and our bodies, thus, developed a mechanism to deal with starvation. That mechanism is deeply intertwined with healing and other bodily systems. We go through substantial damage every day with any work we do. Our cells need constant repair. But if we keep eating, our bodily resources are forced to stay so busy digesting and processing the food that the efficiency of our overall healing gets compromised. Moreover, the fat reserves that we have in store never gets utilized. However, if one hasn’t eaten for several hours, the body will start utilizing its own fat reserves, that is often a source of many chronic conditions, in the absence of new food to fuel us \\xa0in a process called ‘ketosis’ – starvation-induced autophagy. I slowly learned about the many benefits of prolonged fasting – from slowing down aging, controlling inflammation, revitalizing our cells and detoxifying them to even preventing cancer. A YouTube video by Dr Mindy Plezon on what happens to our bodies with each day of fasting gave me further valuable insight on the subject.\\nConvincing my parents about extended fast (72-hour water fast) wasn’t easy. I, first, watched many videos with people sharing their personal experience on the subject and convinced myself of its benefits. I, then, showed my parents a few of those videos and explained them the concept and theory behind it. My father had advised me to start with a 24-hour fast but the benefits of a 72-hour fast and the absence of any significant risks (for someone like me) tempted me to go with the longer version. My mother usually finds it difficult to bear through her 24-hour fasts on Teej festival. So I could understand her concern regarding my 72-hour fast. But I told her I was free to break the fast anytime I experienced anything untoward. So my parents agreed and I started the fast at 2 pm, Friday, May 29, after lunch.\\nSome experts mention that lack of salt intake while fasting may cause severe and acute health conditions. I had learned that consuming salt with water in the morning does not hamper ketosis and that Himalayan pink salt is packed with more than 80 types of minerals and is known to be very good for our overall health. So, I decided to mix some Himalayan pink salt with my glass of water in the morning. During the fast some people drink only water, some drink herbal tea and black coffee without sugar, and some recommend a spoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water once a day. I took a cup of black coffee during the day, a spoon of apple cider vinegar with a glass of water, rosemary and oregano tea, and lots of water. The gut is often called the second brain since the enteric nervous system can generate motor activity in the gut independent of the brain and spinal cord. Moreover, our moods and thought patterns are, in part, dependent on how healthy our gut biota is. Even depression and other mental conditions are linked with gastrointestinal problems and imbalance in gut flora. Anecdotal evidence points toward the possibility that a pinch of salt with a glass of water every morning may help the bacteria in our guts flourish.\\nI didn’t experience any significant discomfort on the first day. I didn’t really even feel hungry. I did some pushups that evening and slept well at night. Day two started normally and till about our usual lunch time (1:15 pm), I was doing well. But shortly after, I started feeling hungry. I went to the kitchen for some water where my mother was preparing lunch. The aroma of the vegetables was very tempting. But I stuck with my water and herbal tea all day. In the evening I started feeling weak but I still went to the roof for exercise. I walked for just 15 minutes and did just five pushups (I usually do 10-15 times in a set). I started feeling a little dizzy in the evening. I think I should have avoided visiting the kitchen during cooking-hours as some people in the YouTube videos had suggested; it did make things a bit harder. They had also warned that the second day would be difficult– they were correct. It took me long to fall asleep that night and the quality of sleep wasn’t very good.\\nDay three started with a similar feeling -some dizziness and weakness and absolutely no urge to empty the bowels (as expected). At lunchtime, I went to the kitchen to see what my parents were having (again, against my good judgment). Never in my life had I imagined I would experience such intense craving for food. The heavenly aroma of the vegetables, the cucumber on the table and every edible thing in the kitchen were urging me to break the fast. The third day started from 2:00 pm (since the fast had started at around 2:00 pm two days earlier). According to the video testimonies, day-three is usually much easier but that was not the case for me. I could feel more weakness and dizziness setting in. I could only sleep for about four hours that night. But with the fast coming to an end, I was happily anticipating all the health benefits.\\nDay four was the day I was supposed to break the fast. I had learned that a big feast after a fast can create problems and it is best to avoid sugar and limit carbohydrates during that period. A small amount of protein is all that people recommend. So, I took a few fried sticks of tofu, some spinach and four pieces of pointed gourd. I then took cucumber and fruits at 4:00 pm and two slices of bread at night. Breaking the fast was quite satisfying but my energy level was yet to get back to normal. The fifth day was much better. I didn't measure my weight but I can safely guess that I had lost at least three kilograms in those three days.\\nIt’s been a month since the 72-hour fast and I can now feel the real benefits. I feel very light mentally and physically: I can concentrate on things much better than before. Fasting has also helped me focus and invest more on other activities that improve my health and well-being. I have been doing 45 minutes of breathing exercise every morning followed by chakra meditationas guided by guru Ravi Shankar. A few years back, Vipassana had helped me immensely in overcoming a difficult phase in my life. I do not know how chakra meditation will benefit me but it is letting me experience some very interesting sensations. I have deactivated my Facebook account for a while to keep myself away from distractions, noise and pointless arguments. \\xa0I have also been regularly listening to spiritual gurus like Eckhart Tolle, Sadhguru, DandaPani, and Vikasananda. I hope I can continue all this even after my schedule starts getting hectic with the gradual relaxation of the lockdown. I am planning to go for an 80-hour water fast after six months of the last fast.\\nBefore 2016, fasting didn’t make any sense to me and I am not coming to any big conclusion on something that I have just begun to grasp. But I can say for certain that it holds promise for many like me who may find themselves lacking in vitality, positivity and joy. As the CEOs of our own health, we need to continue educating ourselves and keep experimenting with tried and tested methods to help us enjoy the best of mental and physical health.\\n(The author is an IT entrepreneur and can be reached at saurav.np@gmail.com)\\nDisclaimer: I am not a health professional or expert.

       "  '\\nThe government imposed a lockdown in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This also resulted in Nepal closing its border with India for human movement but remained open for consignments and shipments transport. The pandemic has inevitably brought many difficulties in all spheres of life from macro-economic degradation to social problems. One of the most affected areas is the food sector. The World Bank and the World Food Program had already warned about the possibility of disruptions in food supply chains which could eventually lead to food insecurity.\\nFor an impoverished country like Nepal, problems related to meeting the dietary needs of its citizens persists — with or without the pandemic. The pandemic and the subsequent lockdown have worsened the situation. According to a survey, food insecurity in the country has increased by 23%.\\nWhile the demand for consumer products has decreased, demand for food and other necessities seems to have increased. The savings of the people are depleting rapidly on food and rent since there has been no income for most of the population. Groceries are reportedly being sold at exorbitant prices, and people are compelled to buy at the seller\\'s rate. The Nepal Rastra Bank noted that the consumer price inflation stood at 6.74% in mid-April, which is 2.3% points higher than the last year’s figure. Food and beverage inflation was recorded at 9.68%, and non-food and serving inflation touched 4.48%.\\nThere are news reports that price of lentils increased by Rs 15-20 per kg.\\xa0 Residents complain of the limited accessibility and availability of food items. Kathmandu reported mutton prices at up to Rs 1,800 per kg at the start of lockdown. Similarly, the price of eggs, chicken and buffalo meat also rose. Though wholesale prices have fallen drastically, retail prices seem to have touched new heights. The probable reason for the price hike could be shortage of human resources and hike in freight costs amidst the pandemic.\\nFurthermore, the Home Ministry’s directive for entering Kathmandu created confusion amongst the vegetable, dairy and poultry suppliers about whether they also need to produce a rapid diagnostic test report. The suppliers complain that they have frequently been facing problems due to lack of coordination between the police and the ministry.\\nIn the Far West province, early signs of food insecurity were already visible in the last week of May. Around 600,000 people travel to India annually for work from the province that doesn\\'t produce sufficient food. As some of these migrants have returned because of the pandemic, a food crisis looms large. Anil Kumar Shrestha, provincial director of Nepal Food Management and Trade Company, has been reported saying the food wouldn\\'t even be sufficient for the nine districts in the povince.\\nMoreover, chemical fertilizers which are vital for paddy plantation were already in short supply before the plantation began, and farmers were worried that their stocks would run out. Since Nepal imports all the chemical fertilizers,\\xa0 any shortage could invite food insecurity and shrink the economic growth prospects. The Agriculture Inputs Company and Salt Trading Corporation had issued tenders to import 25,000 tons of chemical fertilizers for paddy plantation this year. But due to the lockdown, the shipment has remained stuck in Kolkota for over three months. The corporation said Nepal would have to manage with the available fertilizers which won\\'t last long.\\nEarlier, a mechanism between Nepal and India was in place wherein India would export 100,000 tons of chemical fertilizers annually at international price in situations like this. Unfortunately, the treaty expired in December 2019 and hasn’t been renewed since. Many debate that Nepal could import grains and fertilizers from India, but at the time of a pandemic, India may impose restrictions to meet its own food demand. Farmers could otherwise cross the southern borders to buy fertilizers in case of shortage but that is constrained due to border closure now. Furthermore, the annual demand for fertilizers stands at 700,000 tons. Still, only 300,000 tons are imported, which implies that the remaining need is bridged through informal imports or is smuggled across the border. Many farmers rely on these contraband products for their harvest.\\nEmpirical evidence suggests that the shortage of fertilizers has time and again resulted in a decline of agricultural output. Additionally, shortage of other vital components such as credit, labor, and transportation will further hamper the overall production. Erratic rainfall and substandard seeds also contribute to falling supply and stock.\\nSince the imposition of lockdown in Nepal, the supply of food and grocery items has fallen. The Bardiya District Administration Office had requested the federal Agriculture Ministry and the provincial Ministry of Social Development to provide fertilizers, but the government agreed to offer less than 10% of the quantity demanded. This scarcity will likely decrease paddy production by 50% and hurt the lives of the farmers in unexpected ways. The farmers are compelled to buy smuggled products at ridiculously high prices during the pandemic.\\nFortunately, Nepal farmers have managed to gather the second largest paddy harvest in the history last season despite a series of hurdles ranging from a shortage of fertilizers, delayed monsoon to supply of fake seeds and an armyworm invasion. The farmers have begun paddy plantation with the onset of monsoon this year. Nevertheless, shortage of fertilizers persists as most farmers don\\'t have adequate supplies which might shrink their harvest this year. Timely use of chemical fertilizers usually increases paddy yield by 20%. There is also a possibility of disease attack if the fertilizers are not applied within two weeks of planting the seeds.\\nIf the problems mentioned above weren\\'t enough, a new threat looms over Nepal\\'s agricultural sector. The recent locust invasion could further drag Nepal\\'s food security in a new pool of complications. The farmers are worried as they don\\'t know how to get rid of the insects. The huge swarms are capable of \"ravaging\" crops and \"jeopardizing\" food security for over two decades. Though the recently planted paddy may be spared, locusts can destroy the vegetable crops. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, “A one square-kilometre size swarm contains about 40 million locusts, which eat the same amount of food in one day as about 35,000 people, 20 camels or six elephants.” Leaving the locusts problem to poorly resourced agricultural centers will only exacerbate the situation and therefore requires interference from the government as the issue concerns the entire country. If the locusts begin damaging crops, Nepal will have to face massive food insecurity.\\nAs thousands of migrant workers return home after losing their jobs, the demand for food has drastically increased, and there is limited supply.The labor and transportation costs have also increased amidst the pandemic. Some farmers and observers are blaming the local governments for not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure food security in the country. Food rights activists have urged the provincial governments to introduce policies and strategies to tackle the impending crisis. The exorbitant prices of lentils, vegetables and other grocery items have already hit the marginalized and needy families hard and they are barely feeding themselves. Additionally, most farmers criticize the India-Nepal border restrictions, which has aggravated their situation as they can no longer bring fertilizers from across the border. Furthermore, experts have also claimed that any shortage of fuel and irrigation could further contribute to 25% to 30% loss in the harvest. The inability of the government to track the movement of the locust swarms and prepare accordingly might also drastically affect the country’s food security.\\nDespite the government’s increased subsidy on chemical fertilizers from Rs 9 billion to Rs 11 billion, purchase of fertilizers remains the primary difficulty of farmers due to shortage. The Agriculture Ministry has called for a 50,000 tons of fertilizers consignment, but it will reach Nepal only by July-end which is late for paddy plantation. The ministry also intends to distribute 450,000 tons of chemical fertilizers this fiscal year ending mid-July, which is 100,000 tons more than last year’s supply.\\nNepal’s reliance on food imports has increased by five folds in the last decade alone. Furthermore, the import of food will only deplete the country\\'s foreign currency reserves. Therefore, Nepal must find a way forward by increasing funds for research and development to ensure food security and reduce dependence on foreign markets. Agriculture is a vital industry in Nepal as it employs 60% of the workforce and contributes 27% to the total GDP. Krishna Joshi, country representative of the International Rice Research Institute in Nepal, has requested the government to invest US$ 20 million in research and development for transformation of Nepal’s agricultural sector. The International Rice Research Institute and the government have signed a five-year plan to transform the rice sector, but the former is yet to mobilize necessary resources. The government must take appropriate measures to tackle the food security problems before it ruins the future prospects of socio-economic growth. It must also work toward making the country self-sufficient.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nIt was only February when we were in Udayapur district amid my research work to celebrate World Pangolin Day, 2020. As a pangolin researcher, I was pleased to find people across this rural, forested place to be very enthusiastic to help conserve their local pangolin population, part of growing efforts to protect this critically endangered species. With the local people willing to volunteer their time at the frontline of conservation, we even succeed in forming the district's first village-level Pangolin Conservation Committee. Unfortunately, through sad coincidence, that same district later emerged as the hotspot for the COVID-19 outbreak in Nepal.\\nScientists around the world are working to unravel the origin of this zoonotic virus. There is a significant consensus that the virus likely originated in bats, which spread the disease to other species via markets that illegally sell wildlife in China. This may have included spread to pangolins, which may have served as the carriers of the virus before spreading into humans.\\nEven though pangolin as an intermediate host has been a doubt but the news about it might pass some terror among the people and this possibly could change their perspective toward this species. The stigma of taking pangolin sight as bad luck is already threatening the pangolin population in many local communities in Nepal. Pangolins were already on the verge of extinction due to massive trade and habitat degradation.\\xa0Could the terror of its suspected causative relation to the pandemic threaten future conservation?\\nThe relationship between pangolins and COVID19 could result in (at least) three outcomes for their conservation. In one, fear could mean that people fail to appreciate this unique species in their forests, farmlands, and communities. Considering the current state of panic, it won’t be any surprise if some people start to perceive pangolin species as a threat. (In fact, they would present zero threat to humans unless people intentionally come into contact with them.) Such fear could mean that some people seek to remove pangolin from their areas, which might lead to disastrous conservation impacts.\\nIn another scenario, fear might mean that people choose to stay away from pangolin--both reducing poaching and halting consumption. People believe such changes to demand and supply would deliver better conservation outcomes.\\xa0 The fear of zoonosis could encourage people to take further actions to avoid human-wildlife contact by actions to actively reduce illegal wildlife trade, protecting wildlife in their habitat.\\xa0\\nIn yet another scenario, the COVID-19 lockdown resulting in economic hardship and migration back to the rural pangolin habitats become a perfect platform for poachers.\\xa0 There is evidence that some are using this time escaping the eyes of concerned authorities to hunt illegally. They might also take the opportunity to lure local people, particularly those whose livelihoods are currently affected, into helping them in illegal poaching. Previous research has shown that many small-scale poachers in Nepal often have limited understanding regarding the legal punishments for illegal wildlife trade, which can include fines of up to Rs 1 million and 15 years of imprisonment.\\xa0\\nWhatever the scenario, conservation of pangolins is uncertain, and is tightly bound to how people perceive the species. Pangolins are found mostly outside the protected areas in Nepal, and often share habitat with humans and hence it can’t thrive the fear/hatred from people. And if we are aiming for its long-term conservation, people and pangolins need to be living together in love and harmony. This is possible if information about this species is clear and if any emerging fear is mitigated.\\xa0\\nUnder the current state of uncertainty and panic, it is to share timely, accurate messages about zoonosis and conservation. Relevant governmental entities like the Ministry of Forest and Environment, media, conservationists should come to the front and help sensitize people about the realities, including that if we maintain distance from these species its zoonosis will cause us no harm. A clear message on its linkage to COVID-19 should be disseminated to the general public to control uncertainty. To control the risks of possible harm to conservation as a result of COVID-19, it is also important to continue highlighting messages about the benefits of biodiversity - and specifically pangolins and bats - to controlling insect populations, balancing the ecosystem, and potential tourism.\\nThe conservation messages also need to highlight that the global wildlife trade routes and markets should be strictly regulated to ensure public health, high welfare standards, legality, and sustainability. Countries like China and Vietnam are also sending a strong message to the world by regulating the consumption of animals taken from the wild, including pangolins that others should follow.\\xa0\\nFor the benefit of both people and pangolins, we need to communicate not only the right policies but also the correct messages to the public, including about the need for conservation as a strategy to maintain social distancing between humans and protected wild animals.\\n(The author is program coordinator at\\xa0Greenhood Nepal and currently involved in the Rufford Foundation supported research on pangolins in Kamala River Basin)\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nNepal has announced its budget for the Fiscal Year 2020/21 in the middle of COVID-19 pandemic in May end. This article focuses on dissecting the reasons behind the policy shift on electric vehicles (EV) that has sent shock waves through the market. In recent years, the government had brought many supportive policies and publicized ambitious EV targets. The conducive policy signal has successfully leveraged private sector financing in EV sector development with much vigor until the budget announcement. There is a separate government narrative in its defense but in the course of this article, I have attempted to look at other probable reasons including our National interest.\\xa0\\nTo start with, let's look at the EV related official position of Nepal.\\xa0Nepal has aligned its national target with the global effort to achieve climate-friendly public and private transportation system. They are reflected in various policies and plans including National Urban Policy, Environment-friendly Transport Policy, National Action Plan for Electric Mobility, Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2030 published by the National Planning Commission (NPC) in 2016, Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC)-2016 submitted by the government in compliance with ratification of 2015 Paris Agreement during the 21st Conference of Parties (CoP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and white papers published by the Energy Ministry in 2018. The specific targets related to EV are: a) Increase the share of EV by 20% from 2010 level by 2020 and provide subsidy to promote EV conversion of regular vehicles\\xa0(NDC Clause 2.D); \\xa0b) Reduce fossil fuel dependency by 50% in transport sector by 2050 (NDC Clause C.9); c) Substitute 50% of vehicle import to EV by 2024 (White Paper Clause 72); and d) 50% of public transportation as EV by 2030 (SDG).\\nThe objective here is to dig deeper to understand what happened for EV sector in the 2020/21 budget and why that happened. Other aspects that have to be looked into, in conjunction, are energy sector, primarily hydropower and trade, mainly vehicle import from India.\\nTalking about hydropower, the sector that has been primarily focused for economic growth of Nepal and is construed as the growth engine for Nepali economy.\\xa0Nepal intends to achieve 5,000 MW of installed capacity by 2024\\xa0and has set a target of 15,000 MW\\xa0by 2030 (NPC, 2018). The current facts and figures on the status of Nepali hydropower sector include: a)\\xa0Installed capacity of 1,127.8 MW with peak load demand of 1,320.28 MW\\xa0(NEA, 2019); \\xa0b)\\xa0Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed for 6,044.05 MW of installed capacity; c)\\xa0Planned and proposed projects at different development stages constitute 5,154.58 MW (IPP-2,869.38 MW, NEA-2,285.20 MW).\\xa0The catch of hydropower narration is, Nepal will have installed capacity in excess of 6,000 MW by 2023/24. And the addition of 1,300 MW within upcoming fiscal year is declared in the budget itself.\\xa0\\nLet's look at the demand side of electricity.\\nPeak load demand of Nepal had increased at the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8% till 2016 but it has declined after recording 1,320 MW peak load demand for 2019. The NEA has projected that the peak load demand for 2020 is going to be 2,225.6 MW, 69% higher than 2019, which is highly questionable even without taking the pandemic into consideration. For 2024, the peak load demand is forecasted to be 3,703.3 MW, if we are to rely on the NEA's forecast, it still leaves demand vacuum for over 2,300 MW.\\xa0At this point, it becomes relevant to look at investment angle of hydropower. Hydropower projects are 95% locally financed, commonly on 70:30 debt/equity structure. It means, for 5,154.58 MW of under-construction projects, Nepali private sector and banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have already committed $ 8 billion of capital at average cost of $ 1,492/KW and scheduled to be spent by 2024. A point to note here is that the, project construction starts only after sources of fund are finalized and legally contracted known as financial closure.\\nComing back to EV, it has all the good things to say and talk about including environment, energy consumption, climate action, smart transportation etc. That is all fair and good but there are\\xa0two major hindrances for EV in Nepal.\\nFirst is the Nepal-India trade relationship and possible role of private sector. Nepal is one of the big and long-standing vehicle markets for India. India has not achieved satisfactory progress in manufacturing of EV despite its initiatives. Whereas, looking at the global EV perspective, China seems to be the front-runner. In fact, strong position of China in the supply chain of EV is feared by even the West. Battery contributes to around 50% to 60% of the cost of EV and China has almost complete control over the raw materials required to make the lithium-ion battery used in EV. The discourse of Nepal, continuing subsidized EV policy, apparently is against the Indian trade interests. To India, Nepal is a sizable market to sell Indian products. Being specific to the vehicle and associates, as per a Nepal Rastra Bank report, total vehicle and spare parts import from India for 2018/19 was about $ 1 billion. The import of same in the first six months of 2019/20, was recorded at Rs 58 billion (around $ 550 million). The market size in current value terms of over $ 1.5 billion will be largely disrupted for India without even taking the transport sector fossil fuel substitution target of 50% by 2050 into account. India has a monopoly over fossil fuel in Nepal. Coherence to national EV target will lead to fossil fuel consumption avoidance of $ 54 million for 2020 which is projected to increase to \\xa0$ 803 million by 2030.\\xa0 India is by far the largest export destination for Nepal contributing to 64.8% of total export in 2019. Nepal-India trade is governed by Nepal-India Trade Treaty renewed in October 2016 for seven years. As per the\\xa0annual report of Indian Ministry of Commerce for 2019, the treaty provides duty-free access to almost all products imported from Nepal except tobacco, cosmetics etc. Hence, it is reasonable and rational to expect that, India would be interested to cause EV policy shift to protect its national interest. The policy shift has alleviated the business risks and reinvigorated the prospect for large Nepali corporate houses selling Indian-made vehicles in Nepal. To the government, tax on fossil fuels and fossil fuels-based vehicles is one of the largest revenue sources and maintaining that is in its interest too. Giving EV sector a shock, is an ideal confluence of interest protection, where India, Nepal and the Nepali private sector in vehicle business, all key stakeholders of economy, are benefitted.\\nSecondly, Nepal is in a situation where it must find a market to sell its energy as the national demand is not sufficient to consume all the generated energy. And, India or its cooperation is one and only option to sell surplus energy of Nepal and you would not want to offend India at this critical juncture, when in less than a year, you need them to buy your 800 MW plus of surplus energy. The rationale behind the stance is backed by an analysis based on available data to understand the energy need for EV. Relevant quantitative data required for energy estimation were financially modelled. Some data are discrete and explicit; like government targets, vehicle passenger capacity, battery efficiency. And some are continuous data like vehicle running kilometers (VRK), number of vehicles and its users. One may disagree on these numbers based on their own reference. It is undebatable, though, that the quality of analysis is dependent on data quality.\\nThe outcome is interesting. EV is expected to raise energy demand but they will only consume small portion of energy for their battery recharge in comparison to what Nepal will need to sell in course of time. If we maintain the aggressive policy on EV in alignment with our national target, in this year of 2020 itself, EV battery recharging will consume 355.6 GWh or~ 76 MWof energy, to power 1.83 billion vehicle running kilometers (VRK), whereas the country will have to find a market for more than 800 MW this year itself. Similarly, in 2024, the energy required to recharge EV batteries would be 1816 GWh or ~ 392 MW of energy to power 9.5 billion VRK but Nepal will have more than 2,300 MW of surplus energy (NEA demand forecasted 3,703 MW). And in 2030, it will consume 6,744 GWh or ~ 1,456 MW of energy to power 35.3 billion VRK. If we are to trust NEA forecast, the demand will be 6,848 MW for 2030 and we will have more than 8,000 MW of surplus energy.\\nThe critical issue related to hydropower sector of Nepal is a wide gap between demand and supply of energy. The situation has alarmingly questioned the ability of key stakeholders which have jointly crafted an enormous prospective stress to the financial system. It has questioned the forward thinking ability of government for compelling BFIs to invest in hydropower. It has questioned the NEA's ability to make realistic demand forecasting based on which it signed the PPA. It has questioned the technical competency of BFIs to understand hydropower business, which disastrously failed to assess NEA's creditworthiness before blindly making PPA unquestionably bankable. The private sector energy developers' ability of making rational choice for their capital understanding the market dynamics is also under question.\\nThere is a lot to learn from the past to avoid mistakes in the future, but priority of the moment should be, how to rescue the financial system from the crisis. At this juncture, raising energy demand is a more daunting challenge. We can argue, debate, discuss, strategize\\xa0on raising internal demand to consume generated energy at home but the reality is, it is not going to happen, at least in the coming few years. It is more evident, if we look at Nepal's peak load demand trend. But, the time is ticking for the projects under construction. Being the sole buyer of energy, the NEA has commitments to buy the energy generated by all of these projects and is legally bounded by PPA contracts. Except for a few hydropower projects, which have FDI portion in their capital structure, almost 95% of the hydropower sector has not used the counterparty risk guarantee instrument. Counterparty risk guarantee instrument is a hedging tool and like an insurance for hydropower developer who will be compensated for NEA failing to comply with its obligation of buying the generated energy with no market to sell. We can link the domino effect it will cause to the whole financial system and consequent stress it will induce. As per the second quarterly report of NRB for 2076, the core capital of A-class commercial banks is Rs 335 billion (around $ 3.3 Billion). It is over $ 4 billion including government banks. These BFIs have lent 29% of their loan to non-agriculture priority sector which is about $ 6.5 billion. Total non-performing loans (NPL) causing stress to financial system currently is reported as $ 357 million. If we just consider forecasted surplus energy as risky investment as NPL, $ 1.2 billion out of $ 6.5 billion lending this year will be under risk and will gradually escalate to $ 3.4 billion by 2024. The magnitude is beyond the stress level the financial system can take and eventually may bring the whole system down.\\nSo, why did the government take the latest decision in EV sector? Did India cause the EV shock for Nepal?\\nMaybe, because such major shifts in policy is not possible without strong influence. Nepali business houses dependent on business of Indian-made vehicles may have a role. Either way, the result has protected India's trade interest. And, India has a rational motive by all means to exert its influence in the matter and is capable to do so.\\nMaybe not, because the justification Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada has presented defending the policy shift in pretext of tax subsidy missing equitable access, depleting foreign currency reserve, tax collection needs etc. to a large extent are convincing considering the characteristic of Nepali economy and present difficulty. Being empathetic to the Finance Minister, look at the situation in confluence with factors like surplus energy, unconfirmed market, tax collection requirement and prospective fallout, his decision has logical ground and rationality.\\nHowever, the government decision has shaken the already weak foundation of investment climate. Looking at the impact just from EV perspective would be naive. The government assurance of protecting investment to national and international investment fraternity offered through mega events like the investment summit turned out to be a rhetoric of no intent. It is an expensive government adventure against ratification of national and international policy, accords and self-determined targets. Public anguish is just complementary. Years of stimulating government narration has been reverted to hostile approach overnight and it has risked the investment and existence of many micro, small and medium scale enterprises (SME & MSMEs). Policy inconsistency (risk) and unpredictable regulatory regime are among the longstanding perceived hurdles which have hindered the FDI flow in Nepal. The EV policy of recent budget has made it more prominent. Whatever may the reasons and motive behind the EV policy shock be, the consequence is dearer for the short term and immeasurable for the long term. The government has failed to maintain the most rudimentary order required to incentivize economic activities. The timing of policy imposed is more peculiar considering insufficient internal revenue projection to cover the government's recurring expenses, and large part of capital formation to fund development is private sector dependent. The implication of policy shift is detrimental to fiscal health and has undermined the potential of private sector, which could have stimulated the economic vibrancy, much needed in the difficult aftermath of COVID-19.\\nConclusion:\\xa0\\nAlternative and complementary rational discourse considering criticality of the present time is the objective of this write-up. What could be or should have been done, is a never-ending debate. It is undeniable that the NEA failed tremendously in forecasting reasonable power demand. But, the need of the hour is to rescue financial system and hydropower sector, and mitigate the risks of economic downturn. The EV policy shift may be due to the government's wish to collect more tax or Indian influence or corporate influence or maybe to appease the future energy market. Whatever the reason may be, the biggest winner of the policy shift is India.\\nUnfortunately, Nepal exposed itself to evidence of detrimental investment climate. But it can and must be instrumented to yield long term benefits for Nepal. I firmly believe that, Nepal's move on policy shift qualifies as a good gesture to Indian economy and must be leveraged as economic diplomacy. The objective is to have an access to Indian market to sell the energy of Nepalei hydropower sector.\\xa0I personally would like to give this benefit of doubt to the government that the policy shift/shock in EV happened to protect larger national interest of power trade deal. The discourse fits inside the rationality and I choose to remain optimistic trusting the robust credentials of the Finance Minister. We have to wait to see. What we all must be clear is our economy will survive without EV on the roads but it may collapse if there will be no market for surplus energy from the hydropower projects. \\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI was born in a rural village in Nepal about 100 kilometers west of the Indian state of West Bengal. As a teenager, I grew up harboring a very strong anti-Indian sentiment. When I was 14 in grade 8, I read in my history books that the East-India Company and Nepal signed a treaty in 1816 to end the Anglo-Nepalese War. And as a result of that treaty, Nepal had to lose one-third of its territory to British India. \\nI also kept hearing that after the British left India, the two countries signed a treaty of Peace and Friendship which is unequal.\\xa0I was very unhappy with India as a teenager and used to write poems against India to rid myself of my anger.\\xa0\\nA vengeful mentality was growing in my mind and it got magnified each time there was any political tension between Nepal and India. When I travelled to several parts of the world for my study and work, I always wanted to keep a distance from Indians. \\nBut there wasn’t a single country where I did not find an Indian. To avoid sharing a room during conferences and summer programs, I used to write to the organizers in advance requesting not to put me in the same room with an Indian participant, and I would avoid a conversation with them as much as possible. This remained a habit for a long time.\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn April 2015 our Himalayan nation was devastated by a deadly M7.8 earthquake which killed around 9000 people leaving several thousands wounded. The earthquake also destroyed infrastructure that was very costly for a nation crawling, weak and struggling after a decade-long Maoist armed conflict that ended in 2006.\\xa0\\nIn this difficult situation, the people of Nepal had to go through another tragedy. The landlocked nation endured several months of unofficial blockade from its closest neighbor, India. During this time, I was studying in Norway and used to video-call my sisters who were living in Kathmandu. They would cry and say there is nothing to cook, no gas, and other essentials. I would open the news portals to read that there is a shortage of medicine and oxygen in the hospital. An ambulance couldn’t run because there was no fuel. Nepal was on the brink of a great humanitarian crisis.\\xa0\\nThe Nepali in me was boiling, I became very angry, and in that anger, I wished for the destruction of India.\\xa0\\nI introduce myself as a student of peacebuilding. One of the things I reflect on every day is that I must be at peace to understand why there is so much trouble in the world. I realized that I am not at peace at all because of my hate toward India. To me to dislike India meant I was an enemy to all 1.3 billion Indians. The wound was deep, and the hurt was heavy.\\xa0\\nI decided that I must attempt to find some answers to this hatred. This thought kept hitting me round the clock. I could not resist anymore and in 2016, I finally bought a flight ticket to Tamil Nadu, India. I decided not to stay at any hotel. I searched and found that there is a spiritual community at Tiruvannamalai around Ramana Ashram and I stayed with a family there for a month. I biked to different villages nearby and met with anybody I came across. Some of them didn’t know that there is a country called Nepal. It was a sign to me that there is so much to experience in life.\\nDuring this visit to India, I travelled to six states in three months. Since I mostly stayed with the same community, I quickly became “famous” as a new member wherever I went. It happened often that I was invited by different families for meals.\\xa0\\nOnce I accepted an invitation to the home of a very poor family. As I entered, I was greeted by the hosts with their three children. I was given rice and several curries with some fish and was asked that I should eat first. I did not feel comfortable eating alone. However, there is this in our culture that says\\xa0Atithi Devo Bhava,\\xa0which means\\xa0The Guest is God.\\nSo I decided to start eating. I could sense that the kids were also asking for food but I guessed that the mother was signaling them to wait.\\xa0As I finished eating, I was directed to the place where I could wash my hands. On my way back, I looked at the kitchen part of the room and saw that there was almost no food left in the containers. As I paused there for a moment, I felt very bad. I felt a wave of realization passing through my body.\\nThat was a uniquely transformative experience. That family didn’t know that there is a country called Nepal and to them, I was just a guest and they wanted to feed me with special food when they did not have enough for themselves. I felt ashamed of my ignorance and my hatred of the people whom I didn’t know and who didn’t know me. It was a powerful experience.\\nI felt like everything stopped in front of me as I, in that instant, became friends with each of 1.3 billion Indians all at once for the rest of my life. I come from the land where the Buddha was born and I have read him saying, “Hatred cannot be ceased by hatred at any time. Hatred ceases by love.” This was the first time I experienced it for myself. Now, how do I share this peace, oneness, and friendships in words?\\nFortunately for me, I met a community at Panchgani, India, where a global centre of Initiatives of Change has been built. There I listened to several individuals who were able to contribute much more to society after experiencing change in their own life. I found it safe here to share my story. I am now in my third year of participating in this community of changemakers, learning, and growing every moment. \\nWhile travelling with the IofC outreach team, I have attempted to share this experience with thousands of individuals and hundreds of organizations in Nepal and India. I get mixed responses. While many relate and resonate with it, some stretch their eyes in disbelief as if to say I am stupid.\\xa0\\nSome of my friends in Nepal remind me that I am confused and mixing the Indian people with the Indian government, its foreign policy, etc. But my inner voice tells me that I am not confused, that I am being courageous. I no longer see the need to spit venom on the Indian government to prove that I am a Nepali. We can be creative and help one another in finding peaceful and friendlier means to resolve our conflicts.\\xa0\\xa0\\nMy understanding is that our governments are part of us, nothing but all of us individuals put together. In that way, we are all connected. We need to learn to choose the right people to lead us in a better direction and not divide us to cover up their shortcomings. We, as the people from the two countries, can consciously befriend and work as a team toward a greater regional harmony instead of getting consumed by hatred and fear which is only destroying us. \\nWe tend to point fingers at our neighbors, not looking at more fingers pointing back at us. What have we done to the Dalit communities at home in Nepal for centuries? How have we treated our Madheshi brothers and sisters in the plains so that they feel second-class citizens in their own land? Haven’t we humiliated ethnic and religious minorities in Nepal with our sick majority-mentality? Can we learn from COVID- 19 pandemic that isolation is painful and ostracization is a crime?\\nWe must take a holistic look at our motives and behavior to establish a perspective based on accuracy, respect, and inclusion.\\nI see how I had become a part of these social evils unconsciously by just watching and not doing anything, thinking I am too small to affect change. I must be part of a solution. Equity and justice are the fabrics of humanity and social change is possible only with individual practice. If all of us start to see where we need to change as individuals, we are only one generation away from the just and hate-free society that we always talk about.\\xa0\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost all the countries and Nepal is no exception. The country is on lockdown for over 80 days with school closure, restriction on mass gathering and public transportation while the international border has been sealed to break the chain of transmission.\\nBased on available data older people and people with chronic medical conditions appear to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. But children and adolescents are also under risk of infection and can spread the disease. Science about COVID-19 is evolving every day with the coronavirus causing it being new. The unpredictable changes by COVID-19 has a great impact on adolescent health which has to be taken under consideration while formulating strategies to handle the pandemic.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines an adolescent as any individual between 10-19 years. It is transitional phase of growth and development between childhood and adulthood with multiple ups and down. Nothing smooth yet the best stage of life. Adolescent health is determined by multiple factors, which includes caring and meaningful relationship, positive school environment, boundaries of behavior, spiritual beliefs, opportunities of participation, and encouragement of self-expression.\\nToday’s adolescents are global citizens, the powerful agents of change, and the generation of tomorrow. With the shutdown of the school and colleges, the postponement of classes and exams of the academic year, the uncertainty regarding resuming classes and future is leading to high levels of stress and anxiety in the adolescents. The unsubstantiated news and rumors are the other source of stressors among them. Likewise, lack of physical activity, outdoor sports, and reduced social interactions are also affecting their mental health.\\nSchools and colleges are not merely a place of learning. School routines are important coping mechanisms for adolescents to deal with mental health issues. Shutdown of schools, interrupted social services and restriction in movement have cut off the interaction of adolescents with teachers, friends, and increased chances of domestic and sexual violence. The horrific side of COVID-19 is children experiencing suffocation, discomfort and anxiousness at their own home.\\nAdolescents of this era binge on digital stuffs. Increased access to new digital devices (smartphones and tablets) has contributed to a rapid rise in screen exposure in recent years but this has dramatically escalated during the lockdown. They use digital media to socialize with peers using various apps (Facebook, Viber, Twitter, Tiktok) and entertain themselves playing online games (Crossfire, Minecraft, PUBG etc) as outdoor activities are restricted.\\nExcessive screen time in adolescents is associated with behavioral health problems as unhealthy eating and sleep habits, excessive sadness, and difficulty with attention and concentration. Apart from this, unsupervised access to websites leads to exposure to harmful contents (violent or sexual), engagement in online gambling, development of gaming disorder, and sometimes even cyberbullying.\\nProvision of e-learning \\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also brought opportunities and solution along with a plethora of problems for the education system. A handful of schools and colleges are trying their best to bridge the gap adopting e-learning.\\xa0The method includes assigning reading and writing exercises through audio-video methods, and conducting virtual classes. The sudden shift of learning from the classroom to e-learning is challenging.\\nThe pandemic is transforming the centuries-old, chalk–talk teaching model with technology. Some are clamoring for adoption of the new way of teaching and learning despite some of those even with internet access and technology struggling to participate, while the\\xa0 majority are out of reach. This gap exists throughout the country. There seems to be a mixed opinion about e-learning. Some argue the unplanned and rapid move toward online learning\\xa0with no training, insufficient bandwidth, and little preparation\\xa0will result in a poor user experience that is inconducive to sustainable growth while others state a new model of education will emerge, with some benefits.\\xa0\\nNevertheless, e-learning seems effective for students in a number of ways. Learning is possible at their own pace and self-engagement in study is enhanced even though interaction and face-to-face engagement are hard to achieve as in the classroom. Adolescents using digital device for educational purpose with the start of e-learning is an advantage. Conducting formal educational processes online requires both competence and confidence. Effectiveness of learning depends on the level of digital literacy of both the teachers and the students.\\nRoles of parent \\nCOVID-19 is neither the first and nor will be the last pandemic and learning to live with COVID-19 is important instead of panicking. Parents need to encourage the adolescents for physical activity of at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise every day. Outdoor activities like brisk walking, cycling and running whenever possible adopting the safety measures, and getting the children involved in household chores (cooking, cleaning and gardening) are beneficial. Despite some conflicts with the parents, the adolescents rely on parents for emotional support and for setting limits. The role of parents, therefore, \\xa0is crucial in maintaining the health of adolescents.\\nParents are role models to children and the balance between online and offline activities should first be maintained by the parents. Creating an environment of reading books and engaging in creative activities as arts and crafts, singing and dancing reduce the stress and anxiety the adolescents might be going through. Doing yoga and meditation can help a lot. Parents can help children in accessing the online resources that are vital for learning, socializing and playing. At the same time, parents need to be aware and alert to signs of distress that may emerge in children due to online activities.\\nSocial distancing in COVID-19 pandemic is challenging for adolescents who thrive on social connections with peers. The boundary between work and family life is getting blurred when home is also a workplace and school. Afterwork schedule and engaging on social media, interaction within the family is foremost. Parents should be supportive and empathetic toward their children and not force their ideas on the latter. Creating a consistent daily routine is important, with active involvement of children a must during the process.\\nDiverse health issues are associated with COVID-19 pandemic among the adolescents. Shutdown of educational centers happened suddenly as a measure to break the chain of transmission but resumption is far more uncertain. Schools and colleges being vacated for quarantine, unacceptably big class size, and need for hygiene and social distancing mean they should be amongst the last ones to reopen. \\nThe Ministry of Education should announce start of school education with alternative methods. Initiation of e-learning from the government level in the long run will open the pathway for distance education. The digital divide should be tackled and access to digital devices and internet connectivity for the majority, who are currently out of reach, must be improved before that.\\n(The author has a master's degree in child health nursing from the Tribhuvan University and is a lecturer in Hamro School of Nursing)\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nMany of us in Nepal might have played Chhoi Dom, a kind of chasing game, while growing up. The game typically involves the contest between a particular player chosen as a Dom and the rest of the players who have to run away from the Dom. Should the Dom succeed in touching others, the role is passed onto the latter and the game goes on.\\nWhen Navaraj BK went to his girlfriend’s home in Soti of Chaurjahari municipality, Rukum on May 23, the girlfriend's mother reportedly fumed, “Ta Dom Feri Aais?”, meaning “Dom, how dare you come again?” It was, for many of us, a baffling proclamation on the mother’s part. The inner meanings of our beloved game finally came to us. The Dom, they say, exists at the bottom of caste and Varna charts. The Dom dare not marry an “upper caste” girl.\\xa0\\nThe tragedy that was to follow later on the day in the banks of Bheri has, once again, brought the Nepali society’s deep-rooted casteism to the fore. Navaraj, 21, and his five friends lost their lives after being attacked by the village mob, allegedly incited by the girl’s family and the ward chair. Her parents had been rejecting the duo’s long-standing love affair and mutual desire to marry on caste grounds. She was a Thakuri; Navaraj, a Dalit, a Dom. She, at 17, however was three years short of the minimum age for marriage without consent of guardians as required by the law.\\nWhile violence and even murders surrounding inter-caste marriage issues are not uncommon in the “socialism-oriented” republic, the Rukum incident is, by far, the most tragic event of the kind. The slaying comes at a time when the Communist Party of Nepal, which includes the Maoists that waged a decade-long rebellion starting from the district to end all kinds of discrimination, enjoys a significant majority in the parliament. The incident is a slap in the face of their “revolution” for social equality, and Dalit empowerment. As for us, who have played Chhoi Dom and ran away from the Dom, it is a proof of how casteism and untouchability sneaks even into our childhood innocence. These games are not merely vestiges but a microcosm of our centuries old, and yet strong, Varna-caste consciousness.\\nThe 2015 Constitution prohibits caste-based discrimination of any kind and guarantees political representation of Dalits. The election law requires one Dalit member in every ward of local bodies. While rights activists argue that these measures are not enough in themselves, these incidents raises concerns if these present measures have, in any way, been effective at all. To ensure that constitutional reforms addressing casteism bear fruits, political parties have to make sure the Dalit representatives they choose are not just to make the numbers, but the torchbearers of this project. To bring back the trust, impartiality, and competence in the local bodies, political parties ought to focus on their schooling and ethos to defeat social evils.\\nThe arrest of ward chair Dambar Bahadur Malla for his alleged role in perpetrating the crime has once again raised questions about the political parties’ choice for local representatives who have time and again failed in their roles. Early in March 2018, Mamata Prasad Chaudhary, Mayor of Ghodaghodi municipality, was accused of helping those charged of beating 18-year-old Radha Chaudhary accusing her of witchcraft escape punitive measures. Although influence, experience, and connections trump meritocracy in intra-party politics, it is evident that political parties, particularly the ruling party, are slowly failing to bring forward the principled leaders who can give society a direction.\\nMuch of the onus lies in the ruling party which in the past championed the Dalit cause in the region. Despite the party enjoying significant political majority in the local, provincial, and federal units, mob-lynching under an elected representative of the same party is a testimony to the Kathmandu-based party leadership’s wavering dedication toward social equality and justice.\\nThe Chaurjahari incident has also proven that judicial provisions and democratic values are simply not enough to extirpate centuries-old caste structures that pervade the country. The state can intervene and punish the wrongdoers but the social consciousness is something that has to be uniquely local and natural. French political philosopher Alexis de Toquevilee wrote, while democracies declare everyone as free and equal and we are tempted to rely on the state and its power for guaranteeing us what we are owed, but in that process, we lose our mutual ties, connections, and necessary conversations which are far more potent for solving social problems. The changes cannot be top-down; they have to be bottom-up such that every member in the society understands the gravity of the problem.\\nBut contrary to what Tocqueville says, our society is far from establishing a connection that includes all its members. The struggles of Dalits to fit in this hierarchical society has always been characterized by cruelty, inhuman experiences and prejudice. Despite all the political and judicial progress in the country, the so-called upper caste does not seem to be ready to accept the Dalits as equals. Legislations alone cannot assure that Chaurjahari incident will be the last of its kind as society continues to exercise exclusion and discrimination against the Dalits.\\n(Pant is an undergraduate student in Georgetown University Qatar and Bhandari in Kenyon College, Gambier, USA)\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nTens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets of cities across the country on Sunday night in a spontaneous outburst of anger after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly fired his defense minister for challenging the Israeli leader’s judicial overhaul plan.\\nProtesters in Tel Aviv blocked a main highway and lit large bonfires, while police scuffled with protesters who gathered outside Netanyahu’s private home in Jerusalem.\\nThe unrest deepened a monthslong crisis over Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul the judiciary, which has sparked mass protests, alarmed business leaders and former security chiefs and drawn concern from the United States and other close allies.\\nNetanyahu’s dismissal of Defense Minister Yoav Gallant signaled that the prime minister and his allies will barrel ahead this week with the overhaul plan. Gallant had been the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against it, saying the deep divisions were threatening to weaken the military.\\nBut as droves of protesters flooded the streets late into the night, Likud ministers began indicating willingness to hit the brakes. Culture Minister Micky Zohar, a Netanyahu confidant, said the party would support him if he decided to pause the judicial overhaul.\\nIsraeli media said leaders in Netanyahu’s coalition were to meet on Monday morning. Later in the day, the grassroots protest movement said it would hold another mass demonstration outside the Knesset, or parliament, in Jerusalem..\\nIn a brief statement, Netanyahu’s office said late Sunday the prime minister had dismissed Gallant. Netanyahu later tweeted “we must all stand strong against refusal.”\\nTens of thousands of Israelis poured into the streets in protest after Netanyahu’s announcement, blocking Tel Aviv’s main artery, transforming the Ayalon highway into a sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags and lighting a large bonfire in the middle of the road.\\nDemonstrations took place in Beersheba, Haifa and Jerusalem, where thousands of people gathered outside Netanyahu’s private residence. Police scuffled with protesters and sprayed the crowd with a water cannon. Thousands then marched from the residence to the Knesset.\\nInon Aizik, 27, said he came to demonstrate outside Netanyahu’s private residence in central Jerusalem because “bad things are happening in this country.” He called the judicial overhaul “a quick legislative blitz.”\\nNetanyahu’s decision came less than a day after Gallant, a former senior general, called for a pause in the controversial legislation until after next month’s Independence Day holidays, citing the turmoil in the ranks of the military.\\nGallant had voiced concerns that the divisions in society were hurting morale in the military and emboldening Israel’s enemies. “I see how the source of our strength is being eroded,” Gallant said.\\nWhile several other Likud members had indicated they might follow Gallant, the party quickly closed ranks on Sunday, clearing the way for his dismissal.\\nGalit Distal Atbaryan, Netanyahu’s public diplomacy minister, said that Netanyahu summoned Gallant to his office and told him “that he doesn’t have any faith in him anymore and therefore he is fired.”\\nGallant tweeted shortly after the announcement that “the security of the state of Israel always was and will always remain my life mission.”\\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid said that Gallant’s dismissal “harms national security and ignores warnings of all defense officials.”\\nIsrael’s consul general in New York City, Assaf Zamir, resigned in protest.\\nAvi Dichter, a former chief of the Shin Bet security agency, is expected to replace Gallant. Dichter had reportedly flirted with joining Gallant but instead announced Sunday he was backing the prime minister.\\nNetanyahu’s government is pushing ahead for a parliamentary vote this week on a centerpiece of the overhaul — a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. It also seeks to pass laws that would would grant parliament the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions with and limit judicial review of laws.\\nNetanyahu and his allies say the plan will restore a balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies.\\nBut critics say the laws will remove Israel’s system of checks and balances and concentrate power in the hands of the governing coalition. They also say that Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption charges, has a conflict of interest.\\nTens of thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past three months to demonstrate against the plan in the largest demonstrations in the country’s 75-year history. The State Department dismissed as “completely false” claims repeated by Yair Netanyahu, the prime minister’s son, that the U.S. government was financing these protests.\\nLeaders of Israel’s vibrant high-tech industry have said the changes will scare away investors, former top security officials have spoken out against the plan and key allies, including the United States and Germany, have voiced concerns.\\nIn recent weeks discontent has surged from within Israel’s army – the most popular and respected institution among Israel’s Jewish majority. A growing number of Israeli reservists, including fighter pilots, have threatened to withdraw from voluntary duty if the laws are passed.\\nIsrael’s military is facing an increasein fighting in the occupied West Bank, threats from Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and concerns that archenemy Iran is close to developing a nuclear-weapons capability.\\nManuel Trajtenberg, head of an influential Israeli think tank, the Institute for National Security Studies, said that “Netanyahu can dismiss his defense minister, he cannot dismiss the warnings he heard from Gallant.”\\nMeanwhile, an Israeli good governance group on Sunday asked the country’s Supreme Court to punish Netanyahu for allegedly violating a conflict of interest agreement meant to prevent him from dealing with the country’s judiciary while he is on trial for corruption.\\nThe Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a fierce opponent of the overhaul, asked the court to force Netanyahu to obey the law and sanction him either with a fine or prison time for not doing so. It said he was not above the law.\\nThe prime minister said the appeal should be dismissed and said that the Supreme Court didn’t have grounds to intervene.\\nNetanyahu is barred by the country’s attorney general from directly dealing with his government’s plan to overhaul the judiciary, based on a conflict of interest agreement, and which the Supreme Court acknowledged in a ruling over Netanyahu’s fitness to serve while on trial for corruption. Instead, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close confidant of Netanyahu, is spearheading the overhaul.\\nBut on Thursday, after parliament passed a law making it harder to remove a sitting prime minister, Netanyahu said he was unshackled from the attorney general’s decision and vowed to wade into the crisis and “mend the rift” in the nation. That declaration prompted the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, to warn that Netanyahu was breaking his conflict of interest agreement.\\nThe fast-paced legal and political developments have catapulted Israel into uncharted territory, said Guy Lurie, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, a Jerusalem think tank.\\n“We are at the start of a constitutional crisis in the sense that there is a disagreement over the source of authority and legitimacy of different governing bodies,” he said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin announced plans on Saturday to station tactical nuclear weapons in neighboring Belarus, a warning to the West as it steps up military support for Ukraine.\\nPutin said the move was triggered by Britain’s decision this past week to provide Ukraine with armor-piercing rounds containing depleted uranium.\\nTactical nuclear weapons are intended for use on the battlefield and have a short range and a low yield compared with much more powerful nuclear warheads fitted to long-range missiles. Russia plans to maintain control over those it sends to Belarus, and construction of storage facilities for them will be completed by July 1, Putin said.\\nHe didn’t say how many nuclear weapons Russia would keep in Belarus. The U.S. government believes Russia has about 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons, which include bombs that can be carried by tactical aircraft, warheads for short-range missiles and artillery rounds.\\nPutin argued that by deploying its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, Russia was following the lead of the United States, noting that the U.S. has nuclear weapons based in Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Turkey.\\n“We are doing what they have been doing for decades, stationing them in certain allied countries, preparing the launch platforms and training their crews,” Putin said, speaking in an interview on state television that aired Saturday night. “We are going to do the same thing.”\\nRussia has stored its tactical nuclear weapons at dedicated depots on its territory, and moving part of the arsenal to a storage facility in Belarus would up the ante in the Ukrainian conflict by placing them closer to the Russian aircraft and missiles already stationed there.\\nSome hawkish commentators in Russia long have urged the Kremlin to put the tactical nuclear weapons close to the weapons to send a signal to the West about the readiness to use them.\\nThe U.S. said it would “monitor the implications” of Putin’s announcement.\\n“We have not seen any reason to adjust our own strategic nuclear posture nor any indications Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon,” National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. “We remain committed to the collective defense of the NATO alliance.”\\nBelarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine had Soviet nuclear weapons stationed on their territory but handed them over to Russia after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.\\nPutin said Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has long asked to have nuclear weapons in his country again as a counter to NATO. Belarus shares borders with three NATO members — Latvia, Lithuania and Poland — and Russia used its territory as a staging ground to send troops into neighboring Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.\\nPutin noted that Russia helped modernize Belarusian military aircraft last year to make them capable of carrying nuclear warheads. He said 10 such planes were ready to go. He said nuclear weapons also could be launched by the Iskander short-range missiles that Russia provided to Belarus last year.\\nBelarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is living in exile, said the agreement to transfer the tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus “underlines the threat to regional security” from Lukashenko’s regime.\\n“Europe won’t be safe until Belarus dictator is removed & brought before tribunal to face justice for crimes against our country & Ukraine,” Tsikhanouskaya wrote in English on Twitter.\\nLukashenko’s support of the war has drawn international criticism and sanctions. But he has publicly stood by Russia, which has pumped billions of dollars into shoring up his Soviet-style, state-controlled economy with cheap energy and loans.\\nPutin had initially objected to the depleted uranium rounds that Britain promised to ship to Ukraine by making the false claim that they have nuclear components.\\nHe subsequently toned down his language, but insisted Saturday that the ammunition posed an additional danger to both troops and civilians in Ukraine by leaving a radioactive trace and contaminating agricultural land.\\n“Those weapons are harmful not just for combatants, but also for the people living in those territories and for the environment,” he said.\\nPutin added that Russia has vast stockpiles of similar ammunition but so far has refrained from using it.\\nDepleted uranium is a byproduct of the uranium enrichment process needed to create nuclear weapons. The rounds can’t generate a nuclear reaction but they do emit low levels of radiation. The U.N. nuclear watchdog has warned of the possible dangers of exposure.\\nSuch rounds were developed by the U.S. during the Cold War to destroy Soviet tanks, including the same T-72 tanks that Ukraine now faces in its push to break through a stalemate in the east.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0U.S. lawmakers have grilled TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew about data security and harmful content, with some pushing to ban the popular short-video app nationwide.\\nChew, a native of Singapore, told the lawmakers that TikTok prioritizes user safety as he sought to avert a U.S. ban on the app by downplaying its ties to China.\\nBoth Republican and Democratic representatives aggressively questioned Chew on topics including TikTok’s content moderation practices, its data security plans, and past spying on journalists.\\nHere’s a look at some of the concerns about TikTok and its ownership.\\nWHY DOES WASHINGTON SAY TIKTOK IS A THREAT?\\r\\nTikTok, which has over 150 million American users, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd., which appoints its executives.\\nByteDance is based in Beijing but registered in the Cayman Islands, as is common for privately owned Chinese companies. Its headquarters is in Beijing’s northwestern Haidian district, home to key universities and a hub for tech startups. TikTok has dual headquarters in Singapore and Los Angeles.\\nFounded by Chinese entrepreneur Zhang Yiming in 2012, ByteDance is said to be valued at around $220 billion — nearly half of its 2021 valuation of $400 billion. Publicly traded Chinese tech companies and privately held ones like ByteDance have plunged in value since the ruling Communist Party tightened control over the industry with anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns.\\nWestern governments worry Chinese authorities could force ByteDance to hand over TikTok data on American users, exposing sensitive information. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said Friday that China’s government has never and will not ask companies to “collect or provide data, information or intelligence” held in foreign countries, adding the U.S. “has not provided any evidence so far to prove that TikTok threatens U.S. national security.”\\nByteDance says 60% of its shares are owned by non-Chinese investors such as U.S investment firms Carlyle Group and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Japan’s SoftBank Group. Employees own 20% and its founders the remaining 20%.\\nSome details of the relationship between TikTok and ByteDance remain unclear to outsiders.\\nWHAT CHINESE RULES WORRY WESTERN GOVERNMENTS?\\r\\nChina’s 2017 National Intelligence Law states that “any organization” must assist or cooperate with state intelligence work while a separate 2014 Counter-Espionage Law says “relevant organizations ... may not refuse” to collect evidence for an investigation.\\nSince ByteDance, which owns TikTok, is a Chinese company, it would likely have to abide by these rules if Chinese authorities asked it to turn over data.\\nLaws and regulations are only one aspect of the Communist Party’s pervasive control. There are no legal limits on the party’s powers. The authorities also can threaten to cancel licenses, conduct regulatory or tax investigations and use other penalties to compel compliance by Chinese and foreign companies operating in China.\\nThe party sometimes conveys orders using “window guidance,” or informal communication in private. It has used crackdowns to tighten control over technology companies and force them to align with its goals.\\nThe Chinese government has also sought more direct control over companies by getting seats on boards of directors.\\nMUST TIKTOK TURN OVER DATA IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SAYS SO, EVEN WITH “ PROJECT TEXAS?”\\r\\nTikTok has promised to protect data on American users by storing it on servers operated by an outside contractor, Oracle Corp., in what’s known as “Project Texas.” Chew, the TikTok CEO, said all new U.S. user data is stored in the United States and the company should finish deleting older U.S. data from non-Oracle servers this year.\\nThe fear is that ByteDance would have to hand over information it obtained from TikTok if ordered to do so by Chinese authorities, but Chew has said Project Texas will put U.S. data out of China’s reach.\\nByteDance disclosed in December that four employees gained access to data about reporters and people connected to them while looking for how information about the company was leaked. Chew told the lawmakers China-based ByteDance employees may still have access to some U.S. data but that won’t be the case once Project Texas is complete.\\nIn November, TikTok’s head of privacy for Europe said some employees in China had access to information about users in Britain and the European Union.\\nDOES THE COMMUNIST PARTY HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON BYTEDANCE?\\r\\nIn Thursday’s hearing, lawmakers repeatedly tried to pin down Chew on whether ByteDance had links to China’s communist rulers.\\nHe deflected questions about whether staff and top executives are Communist Party members.\\n“I do know that the founder himself is not a member of the Communist Party, but we don’t know the political affiliation of our employees because that’s not something we ask,” Chew said.\\nWhen questioned whether ByteDance was effectively controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, Chew said he disagreed.\\nAfter a lawmaker said the Communist Party holds a “golden share” in ByteDance that allows it to control one ByteDance board seat, Chew said, “That’s not correct.”\\nIn China, so-called golden shares held by official investment funds are one way for Beijing to gain more oversight over business by giving them a 1% stake in companies.\\nChew pushed back when lawmakers claimed that the Communist Party owns shares in ByteDance that give it a vote in how the company is run. “The Communist Party doesn’t have voting rights in ByteDance,” Chew said.\\nByteDance’s main Chinese subsidiary is the license-holder for some of its video and information platforms that only serve the China market.\\nWHAT IS DOUYIN AND WHAT IS TIKTOK’S RELATIONSHIP WITH IT?\\r\\nDouyin is ByteDance’s short-video platform for the China market. It’s similar to TikTok, but its content is restricted by Chinese censorship rules that prohibit material deemed subversive or pornographic - a point emphasized by U.S. lawmakers worried about harmful content viewed by young people.\\nThe Communist Party’s extensive internet filters block most users in China from seeing TikTok. ByteDance has said TikTok has “no affiliation” with Beijing ByteDance Technology Co., the subsidiary that operates Douyin; Toutiao, a news and short-video platform, and other services.\\nHOW DID CHINA REACT TO THE TIKTOK CEO’S WASHINGTON TESTIMONY?\\r\\nMost of the social media reaction in China was sympathetic to Chew, with praise for how he handled the hostile questions lobbed at him.\\nComments on Douyin and microblogging platform Weibo were critical of U.S. lawmakers for asking Chew leading or “trap” questions. Many commenters used a Chinese saying that means “If you want to accuse someone, there’s always a way.”\\n',\n",

But he won’t go to jail immediately because the court granted him bail for 30 days to file an appeal against the verdict. If an appeals court sets aside Gandhi’s conviction, he can get his seat back.\\nGandhi briefly visited the Parliament on Friday morning.\\nSeveral opposition leaders blocked proceedings in Parliament on Friday and later tried to march to the president’s palace in support of Gandhi, holding a sign that read: “Democracy in danger.”\\n’“We fought British, we will fight RSS/Modi,” read other placards they carried. The RSS, or Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, is the ideological mentor of Modi’s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.\\n“The country is witnessing a rule of autocracy,” said A. Raja, an opposition lawmaker.\\nPolice blocked the demonstrators with barricades outside Parliament and whisked them away in buses to a nearby police station. They are expected to be freed later Friday.\\nThe case against Gandhi dates back to an election rally in 2019 when he said: “Why do all thieves have Modi as their surname?” In the speech, he went on to name fugitive Indian diamond tycoon Nirav Modi, banned Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi.\\nNarendra Modi is not related to either of the other two.\\nThe defamation case was filed by a leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in western Gujarat state. The complainant, Purnesh Modi, said Gandhi’s comments had “defamed the entire Modi community.”\\nModi is a common last name in western Gujarat state.\\nMallikarjun Kharge, president of the Congress party, said Gandhi would appeal the verdict in a higher court and called Modi’s government “cowardly and dictatorial.”\\nAfter the verdict, Gandhi wrote on Twitter: “My religion is based on truth and non-violence. Truth is my God, and non-violence the means to get it.”\\nGandhi is one of India’s main opposition leaders and he will most likely go up against Modi when the prime minister seeks a third term in 2024.\\nAlso Friday, 14 political parties filed a petition in India’s top court alleging that Modi’s government was misusing government investigation agencies against opposition leaders for alleged financial crimes.\\nAbhishek Manu Singhvi claimed that 95% of probes by government agencies are against opposition leaders.\\nThe Supreme Court said it will take up the petition on April 5.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nIf India stopped burning coal tomorrow, over five million people would lose their jobs. But for a price tag of around $900 billion over the next 30 years, the country can make sure nobody is left behind in the huge move to clean energy to curb human-caused climate change, according to figures released by New Delhi-based think tank Thursday.\\nThe International Forum for Environment, Sustainability and Technology, known by the acronym iFOREST, released two reports detailing how much it will cost for India to move away from coal and other dirty fuels without jeopardizing the livelihoods of millions who still are employed in coal mines and thermal power plants.\\nEnsuring that everyone can come along in the clean energy shift that’s needed to stop the worst harms of climate change and guaranteeing new work opportunities for those in fossil fuel industries, known as a just transition, has been a major consideration for climate and energy analysts.\\n“Just transition should be viewed as an opportunity for India to support green growth in the country’s fossil fuel dependent states and districts,” said iFOREST head Chandra Bhushan.\\nTo get the $900 billion figure, the group researched four coal districts in India and identified eight different cost factors, like setting up infrastructure and getting workers ready for the transition.\\nThe biggest single investment to enable a just transition will be the cost of setting up clean energy infrastructure, which the report estimates could be up to $472 billion by 2050. Providing workers with clean energy jobs will cost less than 10% of the total amount required for a just transition, or about $9 billion.\\nThe think tank said $600 billion would come as investments in new industries and infrastructure, with an additional $300 billion as grants and subsidies to support coal industry workers and affected communities.\\n“The scale of transition is massive. If formal and informal sector workers are included, we are talking about an industry that is the lifeline for 15 to 20 million people,” said Sandeep Pai, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C. based think tank. “Reports like this are extremely important since the just transition conversation is beginning only now in India ... we need much more.”\\nIndia is one of the largest emitters of planet-warming gases behind only China, the U.S. and the EU. The country depends on coal for 75% of its electricity needs and for 55% of its overall energy needs and is still a far way off quitting.\\nEarlier this month, the Indian government issued emergency orders stipulating that coal plants are run at full capacity through this summer to avoid any power outages. The country’s coal use is expected to peak between 2035 and 2040, according to government figures.\\nPrime minister Narendra Modi announced in 2021 that the country will achieve net zero emissions — where it only puts out greenhouse gases that it can somehow offset — by 2070. On Monday, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres urged nations to speed up their net zero goals, calling for developing countries to set a target of 2050. He was met with a muted response.\\nThe reports recommends that the Indian government focuses on retiring old and unprofitable mines and power plants first. Over 200 of India’s more than 459 mines can be retired in this way.\\n“The energy transition has to start with coal,” said Jayant Sinha, who represents the coal-rich Hazaribagh constituency in the central Indian state of Jharkhand, adding that the switch to clean energy needs both funds and institutions to ramp it up. “Both of this must happen together for a successful transition,” he said.\\nPartnerships with developed countries to help the coal-reliant nations of South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam make a just energy transition have been made in recent years. While these deals are steps in the right direction, they’re too small in scale to make a real impact, energy experts say.\\nIt’s still not clear if India will be open to a similar just energy transition deal.\\nIndian leaders have expressed skepticism over climate funds promised by developed nations, pointing to a promise to give low-income and developing countries $100 billion every year to help with climate challenges back in 2009 that still hasn’t been met.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThe Muslim holy month of Ramadan began at sundown on Wednesday, as the faithful prepared for a month of dawn-to-dusk fasting intended to bring them closer to God and to remind them of the suffering of those less fortunate.\\nFor the next 30 days, Muslims will refrain from eating or drinking anything — even the tiniest sip of water — from sunrise to sunset. Many will strictly observe prayers, read the Quran and donate to charity as they seek to draw closer to God. Family and friends will gather for joyful nightly feasts.\\nThis year many will struggle to afford holiday treats amid soaring prices fueled in part by the war in Ukraine. Iran, Egypt and Lebanon are grappling with economic crises that have weakened their local currencies, making things even more expensive.\\nThe holy month will also be shadowed by the suffering in Turkey and Syria, where an earthquake last month killed more than 52,000 people, and in conflict zones across the Muslim world, though there have been some encouraging signs of possible reconciliation.\\n“We used to look forward to Ramadan as the most beautiful month of every year,” said 19-year-old Rama Jamal, recalling how her family would decorate the house and sit together reading the Quran.\\nNow she lives alone in the war-ravaged northern Idlib province of Syria. After surviving more than a decade of war, her parents and brother were killed in the earthquake.\\n“Now I’m by myself, and there’s no mood of Ramadan, there’s no joy,” Jamal said. “I’m missing my family all the time, every hour.”\\nIn the impoverished Gaza Strip, which has been under an Israeli blockade since the militant group Hamas seized power there in 2007, residents struggling to cope with higher prices also fear another war amid months of soaring Israeli-Palestinian violence.\\n“The prices of many staples have increased crazily,” said Mohammed Forra, a grocery store owner in the Gaza City. He said the price of cooking spices has doubled since last year.\\nMore than 1.8 billion Muslims, who account for around a quarter of the world’s population, are expected to observe Ramadan. Islam follows a lunar calendar, so the month begins a week and a half earlier each year, cycling through the seasons, including the long days of hot summers.\\nThe start of the month depends on the sighting of the crescent moon by local religious authorities and astronomers, and can sometimes vary from country to country. But this year there was broad agreement that it began Wednesday evening, with Thursday declared as the first day of fasting.\\nIn Indonesia, home to the world’s largest Muslim population, worshippers flooded mosques for evening prayers after authorities declared that several Islamic astronomy observer teams had sighted the crescent moon in different regions. Muslim authorities in Saudi Arabia and several other Middle Eastern countries have also announced that Ramadan will begin Wednesday night.\\nMuslims believe God began revealing the Quran to the Prophet Muhammad during Ramadan more than 1,400 years ago.\\nThe fast is one of the five pillars of Islam and is required for all Muslims, though exceptions are made for young children and the sick, as well as women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or menstruating. Travelers are also exempt, including athletes attending tournaments away from home.\\nThose observing the fast must refrain from eating, drinking, smoking and sexual intercourse from sunrise to sunset. They are also encouraged to refrain from cursing, fighting, gossip or road rage throughout the holy month.\\nMany Muslims, particularly those who live in the U.S. and Europe, are accepting and welcoming of others around them who are not observing Ramadan. They also are not expecting shorter work hours, as is the case in the public sector across much of the Arab world during Ramadan.\\nEating or drinking in public during the day is generally frowned upon in Muslim-majority countries. In some, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates — home to a large expatriate population in Dubai and Abu Dhabi — it can be punished by fines or imprisonment.\\nThe normal bustle of cities dies down by late afternoon, with streets emptying and shops closing early. Muslims traditionally break the fast at sunset as the Prophet Muhammad was said to have done, with a sip of water and a few dates. Some can be seen happily indulging in a long-awaited cigarette.\\nAfter sunset prayers, family and friends gather for “iftars” — feasts with local holiday treats like candies and nuts. Mosques and charities set up outdoor banquets where the poor can eat for free each night of Ramadan. Muslims then wake up early for “suhoor,” a small meal eaten just before dawn.\\nFive-star hotels, particularly in wealthy Arab Gulf countries, host lavish iftars, and cable networks unveil big-budget soap operas, raking in millions in advertising. Both practices have been criticized by conservatives who fear Ramadan is becoming too commercial.\\nRamadan culminates in Laylat al-Qadr, or the Night of Destiny, during the last 10 nights of the month, when Muslims engage in intense late night worship. Muslims believe this was the night God sent the Angel Gabriel to the prophet to reveal the first verses of the Quran.\\nAfter the last day of fasting, Muslims celebrate Eid al-Fitr, a festive three-day holiday in which children are often given new clothes and gifts.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0It was a revealing moment during Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s tightly scripted visit to Moscow: Standing in the doorway of the Grand Kremlin Palace, he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that the two of them were “witnessing the changes that haven’t been seen in more than a century, and we are pushing them together.”\\n“I agree,” Putin responded.\\nThe remarks — caught on a Kremlin camera over a bodyguard’s shoulder — offered a rare glimpse into Xi’s ambitions and his relationship with Russia after more than a year of fighting in Ukraine.\\nWhile Moscow increasingly looks like a junior partner to Beijing, Xi is likely to offer a strong lifeline to Putin, his key partner in efforts to reshape the world to try to limit U.S. domination.\\nXi’s unusually blunt statement capped more than 10 hours of Kremlin talks, which ended with long declarations filled with florid rhetoric about expanding the “comprehensive partnership and strategic cooperation” between Russia and China, pledges to champion a multilateral approach to global affairs and criticism of Washington.\\nIn his concluding statement, Putin hailed the Chinese proposal for a settlement in Ukraine, which the West had all but rejected as a non-starter. The Russian leader also rolled out a slew of initiatives that cemented his country’s role as a key source of energy and other raw materials for China’s giant economy. He proposed building new energy pipelines, invited the Chinese to fill the niche left after the exodus of Western businesses, and vowed to boost the export of agricultural products to China.\\nXi remained tight-lipped, avoiding any firm commitments regarding specific projects and mostly sticking to general and vague rhetoric about expanding ties.\\n“A lot of things that Vladimir Putin would have liked to happen did not, in fact, happen,” Rana Mitter, professor of Chinese history and politics at Oxford University, told The Associated Press. “There was no point at which Xi explicitly said that he accepted Russia’s position on the Ukraine war over the position of Ukraine.”\\nIn fact, there was “a sense that China was reserving for itself the right to step away from a complete endorsement” of the Russian position, Mitter added.\\nMoscow and Beijing said they would increase contacts between their militaries and stage more joint sea and air patrols and drills, but there wasn’t even the slightest hint from China about helping Russia with weapons, as the U.S. and other Western allies feared.\\nSpeaking Wednesday before a Senate committee, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said China so far has heeded strong U.S. warnings against providing lethal material support for Russia in Ukraine. “We have not seen them cross that — cross that line,” he said.\\nA top analyst at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said Beijing wants to be seen as a peacemaker and diplomatic heavyweight.\\n“So I think China would be very reluctant to be seen openly supporting Russia with lethal aid,” said Doug Wade, head of the DIA’s China mission group. “It would undermine their whole narrative about their role in the world that they’re trying so hard to sell.”\\nU.S. National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby described the Putin-Xi relationship as “a marriage of convenience,” in which they pool efforts to challenge U.S. leadership, and the Russians “certainly are the junior partner.” He added at a briefing earlier this week that Putin sees Xi as “a lifeline of sorts” amid the fighting in Ukraine.\\nMany commentators argued that the summit marked Putin’s failure to win any specific aid from Beijing and cemented Russia’s increasingly subordinate role in the alliance with China.\\n“China’s domination of Russia is complete,” tweeted Sam Greene, professor in Russian politics at King’s College London. “While there were undoubtedly agreements we are not meant to know about, there is no indication here of a significant increase in military support for Russia — nor even of a willingness on Xi’s part to ramp up diplomatic support. A swing and a miss for Putin.”\\nAfter more than a year of fighting in Ukraine and bruising Western sanctions, Russia’s dependence on China has increased significantly. Facing Western restrictions on its oil, gas and other exports, Russia has shifted its energy flows to China and sharply expanded other exports, resulting in a 30% hike in bilateral trade.\\nWestern price caps on Russia’s oil forced Moscow to offer it to China and other customers at a sharp discount, but despite those lower prices, the vast Chinese market ensured a stable flow of oil revenue to the Kremlin’s coffers.\\nAs long as Russia can trade with China and other Asian states, it will face “no danger of running out of money or being forced to concede on the battlefield, said Chris Weafer, CEO of the consulting firm Macro-Advisory.\\nWhile profiting handsomely from Moscow’s desperate situation, Beijing would be certain to ramp up its support if it sees Russia dangerously weakened.\\n“The nightmare scenario for China is that collapse of Russia militarily leads to collapse of the regime and installment of some pro-Western government,” said Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment.\\nGabuev argued that Beijing would be unlikely to provide any direct military assistance to Moscow anytime soon simply because it doesn’t feel the pressing need to do so. “Russia is not doing great on the battlefield, but it’s obviously not losing it, so the need to support the Russian military efforts so far is questionable from both sides,” he said.\\nMore than ammunition, tanks and rockets, Russia badly needs China’s help in skirting Western sanctions to maintain the flow of high-tech components for its weapons industries and other economic sectors. Sergei Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, predicted that China could be expected to act more resolutely to help Russia get them.\\n“Russia doesn’t need weapons from China,” Markov wrote on his messaging app channel. “It needs microchips and components, and they will come.”\\nSome observers say that while Beijing has been coy about supporting Moscow, it has vital interest in shoring up its ally to avoid being left alone in any potential confrontation with the United States.\\nMikhail Korostikov, an expert on Russia-China ties, said in a commentary for the Carnegie Endowment that China has been closely watching Russia’s experience in facing massive Western sanctions. “For Beijing, a close study and partial use of instruments and decisions used by Russia is a reasonable course in a situation when China’s confrontation with the West looks inevitable,” he said.\\nKorostikov noted that while Moscow’s dependence on Beijing is growing, China’s room for maneuvering is also shrinking.\\n“There is no alternative to Russia as a partner providing resources that China will critically need in case of an escalation in its confrontation with the West,” he said. “It helps balance the situation and allows Moscow to hope that Beijing will not overuse its newly-acquired economic levers.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe decision whether to indict former President Donald Trump over hush-money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign lies with a Manhattan grand jury that has been hearing evidence in secret for weeks.\\nAn indictment of Trump, who is seeking the White House again in 2024, would be an unprecedented moment in American history, the first criminal case against a former U.S. president.\\nLaw enforcement officials are bracing for protests and the possibility of violence after Trump called on his supporters to protest ahead of a possible indictment.\\nAn indictment could also test a Republican Party already divided over whether to support Trump next year, in part due to his efforts to undermine his 2020 election loss.\\nTrump denies any wrongdoing and has slammed the Manhattan district attorney’s office probe as politically motivated.\\nHere’s a look at the hush-money probe, grand jury process and possible ramifications for his presidential campaign:\\nWHAT’S THE PROBE ABOUT?\\r\\nThe grand jury has been probing Trump’s involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn actor Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with him years earlier. Trump lawyer Michael Cohen paid Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, through a shell company before being reimbursed by Trump, whose company, the Trump Organization, logged the reimbursements as legal expenses.\\nEarlier in 2016, Cohen also arranged for former Playboy model Karen McDougal to be paid $150,000 by the publisher of the supermarket tabloid The National Enquirer, which then squelched her story in a journalistically dubious practice known as “catch-and-kill.”\\nTrump denies having sex with either woman.\\nTrump’s company “grossed up” Cohen’s reimbursement for the Daniels payment to defray tax payments, according to federal prosecutors who filed criminal charges against the lawyer in connection with the payments in 2018. In all, Cohen got $360,000 plus a $60,000 bonus, for a total of $420,000.\\nCohen pleaded guilty to violating federal campaign finance law in connection with the payments. Federal prosecutors say the payments amounted to illegal, unreported assistance to Trump’s campaign. But they declined to file charges against Trump himself.\\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s team appears to be looking at whether Trump or anyone committed crimes in New York state in arranging the payments, or in the way they accounted for them internally at the Trump Organization.\\nBUT CAN A FORMER PRESIDENT BE INDICTED?\\r\\nIn a word, yes. Longstanding Justice Department policy prohibits the federal indictment of a sitting president, but Trump, two years out of office, no longer enjoys that legal shield. And the New York case is not a federal probe anyway.\\nWHAT IS THIS GRAND JURY?\\r\\nA grand jury is made up of people drawn from the community, similar to a trial jury. But unlike juries that hear trials, grand juries don’t decide whether someone is guilty or innocent. They only decide whether there is sufficient evidence for someone to be charged. Grand juries exist in the federal court system and in many states.\\nProceedings are closed to the public, including the media. There is no judge present nor anyone representing the accused.\\nProsecutors call and question witnesses, and grand jurors can also ask questions. In New York, the person who could be indicted may ask for a certain witness, though it’s up to grand jurors.\\nNew York grand juries have 23 people. At least 16 must be present to hear evidence or deliberate. Twelve have to agree there is enough evidence in order to issue an indictment. The grand jury may also find there is not enough evidence of a crime or direct the prosecutor to file lesser charges.\\nCenturies-old rules have kept grand juries under wraps to protect the reputations of people who end up not being charged, to encourage reluctant witnesses to testify, to prevent those about to be indicted from fleeing and to guard against outside pressure.\\nGrand juries have long been criticized as little more than rubber stamps for prosecutors. Former New York Judge Sol Wachtler famously said that prosecutors could convince a grand jury to “indict a ham sandwich.” Defenders of the process say it is a crucial safeguard against politically motivated prosecutions.\\nWHO HAS TESTIFIED IN THIS CASE?\\r\\nOne of the final witnesses being called was Robert Costello, who was once a legal adviser to Cohen, the government’s key witness in the investigation.\\nThe men have since had a falling out, and Costello has indicated that he has information he believes would undercut the credibility of Cohen and contradict his current incriminating statements about Trump.\\nCostello contacted a lawyer for Trump saying he had information that could be exculpatory for Trump, according to a person familiar with the matter who insisted on anonymity to discuss secret legal proceedings. The lawyer brought it to the attention of the district attorney’s office, which last week subpoenaed Costello’s law firm for records and invited him to testify.\\nHe was at the building where the jurors were meeting on Monday, invited by prosecutors, ensuring the grand jury had an opportunity to consider testimony or evidence that could weaken the case for indicting.\\nTrump was also been invited to testify, but his lawyer has said the former president has no plans to participate.\\nWHAT ABOUT THE POLITICAL RAMIFICATIONS?\\r\\nTrump says charges would actually help him in the 2024 presidential contest. Longtime ally Lindsey Graham, senator from South Carolina, said Saturday that District Attorney Bragg “has done more to help Donald Trump get elected.”\\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, considering joining the Republican field, criticizes the Trump investigation as politically motivated, “fundamentally wrong.” But he also threw one of his first jabs at the former president in a quip likely to intensify their rivalry. DeSantis said he personally doesn’t “know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some kind of alleged affair.”\\nComments by other potential rivals, eager to convince voters it is time to move on from the former president but also contending with the fact that he remains the most popular figure in the party:\\n— During a Saturday visit to Iowa, former Vice President Mike Pence called the idea of indicting a former president “deeply troubling.”\\n— Asa Hutchinson, the former Arkansas governor mulling his own 2024 bid, said he didn’t expect Trump to withdraw from the race after an indictment, though that would be the “right” thing to do.\\n— Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also served as Trump’s U.N. ambassador, said Monday on Fox News that Bragg’s case was an attempt at scoring “political points,” adding, “You never want to condone any sort of prosecution that’s being politicized.”\\n“At the end of the day, not one single person’s opinion of him will be any different after indictment than it was before,” veteran GOP operative Terry Sullivan said in an interview. “All of his perceived negatives are already baked into his name ID with voters.”\\nWHAT ABOUT OTHER TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS?\\r\\nThe New York probe is among many legal woes Trump is facing.\\nThe Justice Department is investigating his retention of top secret government documents at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, after leaving the White House, as well as possible efforts to obstruct that probe. Federal investigators are also still probing the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to overturn the election Trump falsely claimed was stolen.\\nPortions of a report from a special grand jury in Georgia that investigated whether Trump and his allies illegally interfered in the 2020 election in Georgia shows jurors believed “one or more witnesses” committed perjury and urged local prosecutors to bring charges. The former president never testified, but the report didn’t foreclose the possibility of other charges.\\nWHAT’S NEXT IN NEW YORK?\\r\\nIt’s unclear. Trump declared in a social media post over the weekend that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday and urged supporters to protest his possible arrest. However, there has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work. A Trump spokesperson said there has been no notification from Bragg’s office.\\nLaw enforcement officials have been making security preparations for the possibility of an indictment in coming days or weeks — or a court appearance by the president himself.\\nWILL TRUMP BE HANDCUFFED?\\r\\nAnna Cominsky, a New York Law School professor and former criminal defense lawyer, said that her best guess is that Trump’s lawyers will work out a deal with the prosecutor’s office to avoid the spectacle of an indictment with handcuffs and a perp walk.\\n“There is a great likelihood that he will self-surrender, which means you won’t see a 5 a.m. knock on Mar-a-Lago’s door, officers swarming his house and arresting him and bringing him out in handcuffs,” she said. “He would appear at the prosecutor’s office voluntarily and then be processed, fingerprinted and his picture taken. ”\\nCominsky is less sure that Trump would want to avoid a public appearance for his arraignment, which would come within two days of an indictment. At that time a judge lists the charges and asks if the defendant pleads guilty or not guilt.\\n“He doesn’t shy away from the chaos, so he may want to use this to his advantage,” she said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida made a surprise visit Tuesday to Kyiv, engaging in dueling diplomacy with Asian rival President Xi Jinping of China, who met in Moscow with Russian President Vladimir Putin to promote Beijing’s peace proposal for Ukraine that Western nations have all but dismissed as a non-starter.\\nThe two visits, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) apart, highlighted how countries are lining up behind Moscow or Kyiv during the nearly 13-month-old war. Kishida, who will chair the Group of Seven summit in May, became the group’s last member to visit Ukraine and meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, after paying tribute to those killed in Bucha, a town that became a symbol of Russian atrocities against civilians.\\nXi and Putin announced no major progress toward implementing the Chinese peace deal, although the Russian leader said it could be a basis for ending the fighting when the West is ready. He added that Kyiv’s Western allies have shown no interest in that.\\nU.S. officials have said any peace plan coming from the Putin-Xi meeting would be unacceptable because a cease-fire would only ratify Moscow’s territorial conquests and give Russia time to plan for a renewed offensive.\\n“It looks like the West indeed intends to fight Russia until the last Ukrainian,” Putin said, adding the latest threat is a British plan to give Ukraine tank rounds containing depleted uranium.\\n“If that happens, Russia will respond accordingly, given that the collective West is starting to use weapons with a nuclear component,” he said, without elaborating. Putin has occasionally warned that Russia would use all available means, including possibly nuclear weapons, to defend itself, but also has sometimes backed off such threats.\\nPutin’s comment referred to remarks Monday by U.K junior Defense Minister Annabel Goldie, who wrote: “Alongside our granting of a squadron of Challenger 2 main battle tanks to Ukraine, we will be providing ammunition, including armor-piercing rounds which contain depleted uranium. Such rounds are highly effective in defeating modern tanks and armored vehicles.”\\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the plan shows that the British “have lost the bearings,” and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said “it marked another step, and there aren’t so many of them left.”\\nBut weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commander of Britain’s Royal Tank Regiment, said it was “reckless” of Putin “to try and suggest Britain is sending nuclear material” to Ukraine. He said depleted uranium is a common component of tank rounds, possibly even used by Russia.\\n“Putin insinuating that they are some sort of nuclear weapon is bonkers,” he told The Associated Press. “Depleted uranium is completely inert. There is no way that you could create a nuclear reaction or a nuclear explosion with depleted uranium.”\\nBeijing insists it is a neutral broker in Ukraine, and Xi said after his talks with Putin: “We adhere to a principled and objective position on the Ukrainian crisis based on the goals and principles of the U.N. Charter.” The Chinese plan seeks to “actively encourage peace and the resumption of talks,” he said.\\nIn a joint statement, Russia and China emphasized the need to “respect legitimate security concerns of all countries” to settle the conflict, echoing Moscow’s argument that it sent in troops to prevent the U.S. and its NATO allies from turning the country into an anti-Russian bulwark.\\n“Russia welcomes China’s readiness to play a positive role in the political and diplomatic settlement of the Ukrainian crisis” and the “constructive ideas” contained in Beijing’s peace plan, the statement said. It added: “The parties underline that a responsible dialogue offers the best path for a lasting settlement ... and the international community should support constructive efforts in this regard.”\\nAfter meeting Kishida, Zelenskyy told reporters his team had sent his own peace formula to China but hasn’t heard back, adding that there were “some signals, but nothing concrete about the possibility of a dialogue.”\\nKishida called Russia’s invasion a “disgrace that undermines the foundations of the international legal order” and pledged to “continue to support Ukraine until peace is back on the beautiful Ukrainian lands.”\\nHours before Xi and Putin dined at a state dinner in glittering Kremlin opulence, Kishida laid flowers at a church in Bucha for the town’s victims.\\n“Upon this visit to Bucha, I feel a strong resentment against cruelty,” he said. “I would like to represent the people in Japan, and express my deepest condolences to those who lost their loved ones, were injured as a result of this cruel act.”\\nU.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel noted the “two very different European-Pacific partnerships” that unfolded Tuesday.\\n“Kishida stands with freedom, and Xi stands with a war criminal,” Emanuel tweeted, referring to Friday’s decision by the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant for Putin, saying it wanted to put him on trial for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine.\\nKyiv’s allies pledged more support. Washington is accelerating its delivery of Abrams tanks to Ukraine, sending a refurbished older version that can be ready faster, the Pentagon announced. The aim is to get the 70-ton behemoths to the war zone by fall.\\nThe Russia-China front against the West was a prominent theme of Xi’s visit. Russia’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov accused NATO of seeking to become the world’s dominant military force. “That is why we are expanding our cooperation with China, including in the security sphere,” he said.\\nPutin is keen to show he has a heavyweight ally and market for Russian energy products under Western sanctions. He and Xi signed agreements on economic cooperation, noting Russian-Chinese trade rose by 30% last year to $185 billion and is expected to top $200 billion this year.\\nRussia stands “ready to meet the Chinese economy’s growing demand for energy resources” by boosting deliveries of oil and gas, he said, while listing other areas of cooperation, including aircraft and shipbuilding industries and other high-tech sectors.\\nWhether China will provide military support is a key question. Western officials “have seen some signs” Putin also wants lethal weapons from Beijing, though there is no evidence it has granted his request, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in Brussels.\\nFurther contacts are planned. Xi said he invited Putin to China this year to discuss a regional initiative that seeks to extend Beijing’s influence through economic cooperation.\\nMoscow and Beijing have both weathered international condemnation of their human rights records. The Chinese government is accused of atrocities against Uighur Muslims in its far western Xinjiang region. The allegations include genocide, forced sterilization and the mass detention of nearly 1 million Uighurs. Beijing has denied the allegations. Russia has been accused of war crimes in Ukraine, charges it denies.\\nKishida rode a train from Poland to Kyiv just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi and a week after a breakthrough summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yoel.\\nBoth China and Japan have enjoyed recent diplomatic successes that emboldened their foreign policy.\\nJapan, which has engaged in territorial disputes over islands with both China and Russia, is particularly concerned about the Beijing-Moscow relationship. Both nations have conducted joint military exercises near Japan’s coasts.\\nBeijing’s diplomatic foray follows its recent success in brokering a deal between Iran and its chief Middle Eastern rival, Saudi Arabia, to restore relations after years of tensions. The move displayed China’s influence in a region where Washington has long been the major foreign player.\\nKishida became Japan’s first postwar leader to enter a war zone.\\nDue to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has been limited to nonlethal equipment and humanitarian supplies. It has contributed more than $7 billion to Ukraine and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians, despite its strict immigration policy.\\nTokyo joined the U.S. and European nations in sanctioning Russia over the invasion. By contrast, China has refused to condemn Moscow’s aggression and criticized Western sanctions against Moscow, while accusing NATO and Washington of provoking Putin’s military action.\\nJapan fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.\\nIn Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said of Kishida’s trip: “We hope Japan could do more things to deescalate the situation instead of the opposite.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWhen China suddenly scrapped onerous zero-COVID measures in December, the country wasn’t ready for a massive onslaught of cases. Hospitals turned away ambulances, crematoriums burned bodies around the clock, and relatives hauled dead loved ones to warehouses for lack of storage space.\\nChinese state media claimed the decision to open up was based on “scientific analysis and shrewd calculation,” and “by no means impulsive.” But in reality, China’s ruling Communist Party ignored repeated efforts by top medical experts to kickstart exit plans until it was too late, The Associated Press found.\\nInstead, the reopening came suddenly at the onset of winter, when the virus spreads most easily. Many older people weren’t vaccinated, pharmacies lacked antivirals, and hospitals didn’t have adequate supplies or staff — leading to as many as hundreds of thousands of deaths that could have been avoided, according to academic modeling, more than 20 interviews with current and former Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention employees, experts and government advisers, and internal reports and directives obtained by the AP.\\n“If they had a real plan to exit earlier, so many things could have been avoided,” said Zhang Zuo-Feng, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. “Many deaths could have been prevented.”\\nFor two years, China stood out for its tough but successful controls against the virus, credited with saving millions of lives as other countries struggled with stop-and-start lockdowns. But with the emergence of the highly infectious omicron variant in late 2021, many of China’s top medical experts and officials worried zero-COVID was unsustainable.\\nIn late 2021, China’s leaders began discussing how to lift restrictions. As early as March 2022, top medical experts submitted detailed proposals to prepare for a gradual exit to the State Council, China’s cabinet.\\nBut discussions were silenced after an outbreak the same month in Shanghai, which prompted Chinese leader Xi Jinping to lock the city down. Zero-COVID had become a point of national pride, and Beijing’s crackdown on dissent under Xi had made scientists reluctant to speak out against the party line.\\nBy the time the Shanghai outbreak was under control, China was months away from the 20th Party Congress, the country’s most important political meeting in a decade, making reopening politically difficult. So the country stuck to mass testing and quarantining millions of people, even as omicron evaded increasingly draconian controls.\\nUnrest began to simmer, with demonstrations, factory riots, and shuttered businesses. The pressure mounted until the authorities suddenly yielded, allowing the virus to sweep the country with no warning — and with deadly consequence.\\nExperts estimate that many hundreds of thousands of people, perhaps millions, may have died in China’s wave of COVID — far higher than the official toll of under 90,000, but still a much lower death rate than in Western countries. However, 200,000 to 300,000 deaths could have been prevented if the country was better vaccinated and stocked with antivirals, according to modeling by the University of Hong Kong and scientist estimates. Some scientists think even more lives could have been saved.\\n“It wasn’t a sound public health decision at all,” said a China CDC official, declining to be named to speak candidly on a sensitive matter. “It’s absolutely bad timing … this was not a prepared opening.”\\n___\\nPLANS DERAILED\\r\\nToward the end of 2021, many public health experts and leaders began thinking about how to exit from the zero-COVID policy. The less lethal but far more infectious omicron made curbing COVID-19 harder and the risks of its spread lower, and nearby Korea, Japan and Singapore were all loosening controls.\\nThat winter, the State Council appointed public health experts to a new committee tasked with reviewing COVID-19 controls, which submitted a report in March 2022, four people with knowledge of it said. The existence of the document is being reported for the first time by the AP.\\nIt concluded it was time for China to begin preparations for a possible reopening. It ran over 100 pages long and included detailed proposals to boost China’s stalling vaccination campaign, increase ICU bed capacity, stock up on antivirals, and order patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms to stay at home, one of the people said. It also included a proposal to designate Hainan, a tropical island in the country’s south, as a pilot zone to experiment with relaxing controls.\\nBut then things began going awry.\\nA chaotic, deadly outbreak in Hong Kong alarmed Beijing. Then in March, the virus began spreading in Shanghai, China’s cosmopolitan finance hub.\\nInitially, Shanghai took a light approach with targeted lockdowns sealing individual buildings — a pioneering strategy led by doctor Zhang Wenhong, who had been openly calling on the government to prepare to reopen. But soon, officials in neighboring provinces complained they were seeing cases from Shanghai and asked the central leadership to lock the city down, according to three people familiar with the matter.\\nChina CDC contact tracing reports obtained by the AP show that a nearby province was detecting dozens of COVID-19 cases by early March, all from Shanghai. Provincial officials argued that they lacked Shanghai’s medical resources and capacity to trace the virus, risking its spread to the entire country before China was ready.\\nAt the same time, China’s flagging vaccination rate for older residents and the deaths in Hong Kong spooked authorities, as did reports of long COVID-19 abroad. When Shanghai failed to get control of the virus, the top leadership stepped in. Partial lockdowns in Shanghai were announced in late March. On April 2, then-Vice Premier Sun Chunlan, a top official known widely as the “COVID czar,” traveled there to oversee a total lockdown.\\n“They lost their nerve,” said an expert in regular contact with Chinese health officials.\\nShanghai was ill-prepared. Residents exploded in anger online, complaining of hunger and spotty supplies. But Beijing made it clear that the lockdown would continue.\\n“Resolutely uphold zero-COVID,” an editorial in the state-run People’s Daily said. “Persistence is victory,” said Xi.\\n___\\nKEEPING SILENCE\\r\\nAfter Shanghai locked down, Chinese public health experts stopped speaking publicly about preparing for an exit. None dared openly challenge a policy supported by Xi. Some experts were blacklisted from Chinese media, one told the AP.\\n“Anybody who wanted to say something that is different from the official narrative was basically just silenced,” the blacklisted expert said.\\nIn early April, China’s State Council leaked a letter from the European Chamber of Commerce urging relaxation of zero-COVID controls. Council officials wanted to spark debate but didn’t feel empowered to raise the issue themselves, according to a person directly familiar with the matter.\\nThe State Council’s information office did not respond to a fax requesting comment.\\nGao Fu, then head of the China CDC, also hinted at the need to prepare for an exit. At a mid-April internal panel discussion recently made public by the Beijing-based Center for China and Globalization think tank, Gao was quoted as saying “omicron is not that dangerous,” that there were public discussions on whether zero-COVID needed to be adjusted, and that they “hope to reach a consensus as soon as possible.”\\nWeeks later, at a private event at the German Embassy in Beijing, Gao agreed with foreign experts urging China to plan a reopening and then strode off the stage, according to three attendees who declined to be named because they weren’t authorized to speak to the press. Gao did not respond to an email requesting comment.\\nThere were also hints that opinions differed high in the party.\\nIn private meetings with Western business chambers in May, then-Premier Li Keqiang, who was head of the State Council and the party’s No. 2 official at the time, appeared sympathetic to complaints about how zero-COVID was crushing the economy, according to a participant and another briefed on the meetings. It was a stark contrast with pre-recorded remarks from Xi that listed defeating COVID as the top priority. But under Xi, China’s most authoritarian leader in decades, Li was powerless, analysts say.\\nPublic health experts split into camps. Those who thought zero-COVID unsustainable — like Gao and Zhang, the Shanghai doctor — fell silent. But Liang Wannian, then head of the central government’s expert working group on COVID-19, kept vocally advocating for zero-COVID as a way to defeat the virus. Though Liang has a doctorate in epidemiology, he is sometimes accused of pushing the party line rather than science-driven policies.\\n“He knows what Xi wants to hear,” said Ray Yip, the founding head of the United States CDC office in China.\\nLiang shot down suggestions for reopening in internal meetings in January and May of 2022, Yip said, making it difficult for others to suggest preparations for an exit. Liang did not respond to an email requesting comment.\\nHealth authorities also knew that once China reopened, there would be no going back. Some were spooked by unclear data, long COVID and the chance of deadlier strains, leaving them wracked with uncertainty.\\n“Every day, we were flooded with oceans of unverified data,” said a China CDC official. “Every week we heard about new variants. … Yes, we should find a way out of zero-COVID, but when and how?”\\nAuthorities may also have been waiting for the virus to weaken further or for new, more effective, Chinese-developed mRNA vaccines.\\n“They didn’t have a sense of urgency,” said Zhu Hongshen, a postdoctoral fellow studying China’s zero-COVID policy at the University of Pennsylvania. “They thought they could optimize the whole process, they thought they had time.”\\nThe Shanghai lockdown stretched from an expected eight days to two months. By the time Shanghai opened back up, it was just months away from China’s pivotal 20th Party Congress, where Xi was expected to be confirmed for a controversial and precedent-breaking third term.\\nRisking an outbreak was off the table. Though scientists from Beijing, Shanghai and Wuhan wrote internal petitions urging the government to start preparations, they were told to stay silent until the congress was over.\\n“Everybody waits for the party congress,” said one medical expert, declining to be named to comment on a sensitive topic. “There’s inevitably a degree of everyone being very cautious.”\\n___\\nINCREASING PRESSURE\\r\\nOfficials across China took extraordinary measures to stop omicron from spreading.\\nTourists were locked into hotels, traders were huddled into indefinite quarantine and many stopped traveling for fear of being stranded far from home. In Inner Mongolia, a state-run ammunition factory forced workers to live in its compound 24 hours a day for weeks on end away from their families, according to Moses Xu, a retired worker.\\nIn brutal lockdowns for over three months in China’s far west, residents in Xinjiang starved, while thousands in Tibet marched on the streets, defying orders in a rare protest. Still, officials stuck to their guns, as the government fired those who didn’t keep COVID under control.\\nYet omicron kept spreading. As the congress approached, authorities began hiding cases and resorting to secret lockdowns and quarantines.\\nAuthorities locked down Zhengzhou, a provincial capital home to over 10 million people, with no public announcement, even though they were reporting only a handful of cases. They bused some Beijing residents to distant quarantine centers and asked them not to post online about it, one told the AP. Some village officials deliberately underreported the number of COVID-19 cases to give the sense that the virus was under control.\\nLocal governments poured tens of billions of dollars into mass testing and quarantine facilities. From Wuhan to villages in industrial Hebei province, civil servants were pressed into testing or quarantine duty because local governments ran out of money to hire workers.\\nAt the Congress in mid-October, top officials differing with Xi were sidelined. Instead, six loyalists followed Xi onstage in a new leadership lineup, signaling his total domination of the party.\\n___\\nPUSHING FOR CHANGE\\r\\nWith the congress over, some voices in the public health sector finally piped up.\\nIn an internal document published Oct. 28, obtained by The Associated Press and reported here for the first time, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s CDC, criticized the Beijing city government for excessive COVID controls, saying it had “no scientific basis.” He called it a “distortion” of the central government’s zero-COVID policy, which risked “intensifying public sentiment and causing social dissatisfaction.”\\nAt the same time, he called the virus policies of the central government “absolutely correct.” One former CDC official said Wu felt helpless because he was ordered to advocate for zero-COVID in public, even as he disagreed at times with its excesses in private.\\nWu did not respond to an email requesting comment. A person acquainted with Wu confirmed he wrote the internal report.\\nAnother who spoke up was Zhong Nanshan, a doctor renowned for raising the alarm about the original COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan. He wrote twice to Xi personally, telling him that zero-COVID was not sustainable and urging a gradual reopening, said a person acquainted with Zhong. Business people in finance, trade, and manufacturing concerned about the tanking economy were also lobbying authorities behind the scenes, a government adviser told the AP.\\nAlong with the lobbying, pressure to reopen came from outbreaks flaring up across the country. A Nov. 5 internal notice issued by Beijing health authorities and obtained by the AP called the virus situation “severe.”\\nIn early November, Sun, China’s top “COVID czar,” summoned experts from sectors including health, travel and the economy to discuss adjusting Beijing’s virus policies, according to three people with direct knowledge of the meetings. Zhong, the prominent doctor, presented data from Hong Kong showing omicron’s low fatality rate after the city’s last outbreak, two said.\\nOn Nov. 10, Xi ordered adjustments.\\n“Adhere to scientific and precise prevention and control,” Xi said, according to a state media account, signaling he wanted officials to cut back on extreme measures.\\nThe next day, Beijing announced 20 new measures tweaking restrictions, such as reclassifying risk zones and reducing quarantine times. But at the same time, Xi made clear, China was sticking to zero-COVID.\\n“Necessary epidemic prevention measures cannot be relaxed,” Xi said.\\n___\\nTHE EXIT\\r\\nThe government wanted order. Instead, the measures caused chaos.\\nWith conflicting signals from the top, local governments weren’t sure whether to lock down or open up. Policies changed by the day.\\nIn Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province, officials canceled mass testing and opened the city, only to reinstate harsh measures days later. Xi called city officials, instructing them to have measures that were neither too strict nor too soft, according to a person familiar with the matter.\\nIndividual apartments were put under sudden lockdowns that lasted hours or days. The sheer number of tests and cases overwhelmed medical workers. Travel, shopping, and dining ground to a halt, streets emptied, and the wealthy bought one-way plane tickets out of China.\\nIn late November, public frustration boiled over. A deadly apartment fire in China’s far west Xinjiang region sparked nationwide protests over locked doors and other virus control measures. Some called on Xi to resign, the most direct challenge to the Communist Party’s power since pro-democracy protests in 1989.\\nRiot police moved in and the protests were swiftly quelled. But behind the scenes, the mood was shifting.\\nReferences to “zero-COVID” vanished from government statements. State newswire Xinhua said the pandemic was causing “fatigue, anxiety and tension,” and that the cost of controlling it was increasing day by day.\\nDays after the protests, Sun, the COVID czar, held meetings where she told medical experts the state planned to “walk briskly” out of zero-COVID. Some were struck by how quickly the tone had shifted, with one saying the leadership had become “even more radical” than the experts, according to a retired official.\\nOn Dec. 1, Xi told visiting European Council President Charles Michel that the protests were driven by youth frustrated with the lockdowns, according to a person briefed on Xi’s remarks.\\n“We listen to our people,” the person recounted Xi telling Michel.\\nThe final decision was made suddenly, and with little direct input from public health experts, several told the AP.\\n“None of us expected the 180-degree turn,” a government adviser said.\\nMany in the Chinese government believe the protests accelerated Xi’s decision to scrap virus controls entirely, according to three current and former state employees.\\n“It was the trigger,” said one, not identified because they weren’t authorized to speak to the media.\\nOn Dec. 6, Xi instructed officials to change COVID-19 controls, Xinhua reported.\\nThe next day, Chinese health authorities announced 10 sweeping measures that effectively scrapped controls, canceling virus test requirements, mandatory centralized quarantine and location-tracking health QR codes. The decision to reopen so suddenly caught the country by surprise.\\n“Even three days’ notice would have been good,” said a former China CDC official. “The way this happened was just unbelievable.”\\nSoon, the sick overran emergency wards and patients sprawled on floors. COVID-19 antivirals sold for thousands of dollars a box on the black market.\\nIn just six weeks, about 80% of the country was infected — more than a billion people, the China CDC later estimated. But even as deaths mounted, authorities ordered state media to deflect criticism over China’s sudden reopening, according to a leaked directive obtained by a former state media journalist and posted online.\\n“Make a big propaganda push,” it ordered. “Counter the false claims leveled by the United States and the West that we were ‘forced to open’ and ‘hadn’t prepared.’”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida began a surprise visit to Ukraine early Tuesday, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping arrived in neighboring Russia for a three-day visit. The dueling summits come as the longtime rivals are on diplomatic offensives.\\nKishida will meet President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Ukrainian capital.\\nHe will “show respect to the courage and patience of the Ukrainian people who are standing up to defend their homeland under President Zelenskyy’s leadership, and show solidarity and unwavering support for Ukraine as head of Japan and chairman of G-7,” during his visit to Ukraine, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said in announcing his trip to Kyiv.\\nAt the talks, Kishida will show his “absolute rejection of Russia’s one-sided change to the status quo by invasion and force, and to affirm his commitment to defend the rules-based international order,” the ministry’s statement said.\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warmly welcomed Xi to the Kremlin on a visit both nations describe as an opportunity to deepen their “no-limits friendship.”\\nJapanese public television channel NTV showed Kishida riding a train from Poland heading to Kyiv. His surprise trip to Ukraine comes just hours after he met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi, and the week after a breakthrough summit with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yoel.\\nIn New Delhi, Kishida called for developing and Global South countries to raise their voices to defend the rules-based international order and help stop Russia’s war.\\nJapan, which has territorial disputes over islands with both China and Russia, is particularly concerned about the close relationship between Beijing and Moscow, which have conducted joint military exercises near Japan’s coasts.\\nKishida, who is to chair the Group of Seven summit in May, is the only G-7 leader who hasn’t visited Ukraine and was under pressure to do so at home. U.S. President Joe Biden took a similar route to visit Kyiv last month, just before the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nDue to limitations of Japan’s pacifist constitution, his trip was arranged secretly. Kishida is Japan’s first postwar leader to enter a war zone. Kishida, invited by Zelenskyy in January to visit Kyiv, was also asked before his trip to India about a rumor of his possible trip at the end of March, denied it and said nothing concrete has been decided.\\nJapan has joined the United States and European nations in sanctioning Russia over its invasion and providing humanitarian and economic support for Ukraine.\\nJapan was quick to react because it fears the possible impact of a war in East Asia, where China’s military has grown increasingly assertive and has escalated tensions around self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.\\nIn Beijing, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that Beijing’s contacts with Russia will help to bring about peace. “President Putin said that Russia appreciates China’s consistent position of upholding fairness, objectivity and balance on major international issues,” he said. “Russia has carefully studied China’s position paper on the political settlement of the Ukrainian issue, and is open to peace talks.”\\nAsked about Kishida’s trip to Kyiv, he added, “We hope Japan could do more things to deescalate the situation instead of the opposite.”\\nKishida is expected to offer continuing support for Ukraine when he meets with Zelenskyy.\\nTelevision footage on NTV showed Kishida getting on a train from the Polish station of Przemysl near the border with Ukraine, with a number of officials.\\nDue to its pacifist principles, Japan’s support for Ukraine has also been limited to non-combative military equipment such as helmets, bulletproof vests and drones, and humanitarian supplies including generators.\\nJapan has contributed more than $7 billion to Ukraine, and accepted more than 2,000 displaced Ukrainians and helped them with housing assistance and support for jobs and education, a rare move in a country that is known for its strict immigration policy.\\n',\n",

The Kremlin, which doesn’t recognize the authority of the ICC, has rejected its move as “legally null and void.”\\nChina’s foreign ministry on Monday called on the ICC to “respect the jurisdictional immunity” of a head of state and “avoid politicization and double standards.”\\nChina looks to Russia as a source of oil and gas for its energy-hungry economy and as a partner in opposing what both see as American domination of global affairs.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nChinese leader Xi Jinping is due to meet Vladimir Putin in Moscow in a political boost for the isolated Russian president after the International Criminal Court charged him with war crimes in Ukraine.\\nXi’s government gave no details of what the Chinese leader hoped to accomplish. Xi and Putin declared they had a “no-limits friendship” before the February 2022 attack on Ukraine, but China has tried to portray itself as neutral. Beijing called for a cease-fire last month, but Washington said that would ratify the Kremlin’s battlefield gains.\\nThe Chinese government said Xi would visit Moscow from Monday to Wednesday but gave no indication when he departed. The Russian government said Xi was due to arrive midday and meet later with Putin.\\nChina looks to Russia as a source of oil and gas for its energy-hungry economy and as a partner in opposing what both see as American domination of global affairs.\\nADVERTISEMENT\\r\\nThe meeting gives Putin and Xi a chance to show they have “powerful partners” at a time of strained relations with Washington, said Joseph Torigian, an expert in Chinese-Russian relations at American University in Washington.\\n“China can signal that it could even do more to help Russia, and that if relations with the United States continue to deteriorate, they could do a lot more to enable Russia and help Russia in its war against Ukraine,” Torigian said.\\nBeijing’s relations with Washington, Europe and its neighbors are strained by disputes over technology, security, human rights and the ruling Communist Party’s treatment of Hong Kong and Muslim minorities.\\nSome commentators have drawn a parallel between Russia’s claims to Ukrainian territory and Beijing’s claim to Taiwan. The Communist Party says the self-ruled island democracy, which split with China in 1949 after a civil war, is obliged to unite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Xi’s government has been stepping up efforts to intimidate the island by flying fighter jets nearby and firing missiles into the sea.\\nTaiwan voters will choose a new president next year, and in an apparent bid to sway sentiment, former president Ma Ying-jeou of the opposition Nationalist Party will visit China next week.\\nMa presided over a period of warm ties with Beijing, but left office under a cloud after China’s legislature rejected a trade deal amid the country’s largest protests since the 1990s.\\nChina’s campaign of diplomatic isolation and military threats have prompted a backlash against Chinese companies overseas and growing support for Taiwan in the U.S. House and European parliaments.\\nIn the latest in a chain of delegations, Bob Stewart, chair of the British-Taiwanese All-Party Parliamentary Group, arrived Sunday in Taipei. Other members of the delegation include Members of Parliament Rob Butler, Sarah Atherton, Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi, Afzal Khan, and Marie Rimmer.\\nAlong with India and other countries who claim neutrality in the Ukraine conflict, China has stepped up purchases of Russian oil and gas, helping to top up the Kremlin’s revenue in the face of Western sanctions.\\nChina has avoided doing anything visible that crosses the red lines laid down by Washington and European governments in regard to financial sanctions and the provision of military aid.\\nThis week’s meeting follows the ICC announcement Friday of charges that Putin is personally responsible for the abductions of thousands of children from Ukraine. Governments that recognize the court’s jurisdiction would be obligated to arrest Putin if he visits.\\nPutin has yet to comment on the announcement, but the Kremlin rejected the move as “outrageous and unacceptable.”\\nIn a show of defiance, Putin over the weekend visited Crimea and the occupied Ukrainian port city of Mariupol to mark the ninth anniversary of Russia’s seizure of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine. Russian news reports showed him chatting with Mariupol residents and visiting an art school and a children’s center in Sevastopol in Crimea.\\nXi said in an article published Monday in the Russian newspaper Russian Gazette that China has “actively promoted peace talks” but announced no initiatives.\\n“My upcoming visit to Russia will be a journey of friendship, cooperation and peace,” Xi wrote, according to text released by the official Xinhua News Agency.\\n“A reasonable way to resolve the crisis” can be found if “all parties embrace the vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security,” Xi wrote.\\nThe trip follows the surprise announcement of a diplomatic thaw between Iran and Saudi Arabia following a meeting in Beijing, a diplomatic coup for Xi’s government.\\nXi wants to be seen as a global statesman who is “playing a constructive role” by talking about peace but is unlikely to press Putin to end the war, said Torigian.\\nBeijing is worried about “potential Russian losses on the battlefield” but doesn’t want to be seen to “enable Russia’s aggression,” said Torigian.\\n“They won’t spend political capital” on pressing Moscow to make peace, “especially if they don’t think it will get them anything,” he said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNorth Korea said Monday it simulated a nuclear attack on South Korea with a ballistic missile launch over the weekend that was its fifth missile demonstration this month to protest the largest joint military exercises in years between the U.S. and South Korea.\\nThe North’s leader Kim Jong Un instructed his military to hold more drills to sharpen the war readiness of his nuclear forces in the face of “aggression” by his enemies, state media reported.\\nThe South Korean and Japanese militaries detected the short-range missile being launched Sunday into waters off the North’s eastern coast less than an hour before the U.S. flew long-range B-1B bombers for training with South Korean warplanes. The North characterizes the U.S.-South Korea exercises as a rehearsal to invade, though the allies insist they are defensive in nature. Some experts say the North uses the exercises as a pretext to advance its weapons programs.\\nPyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the missile, which flew about 800 kilometers (500 miles), was tipped with a mock nuclear warhead. It described the test as successful, saying that the device detonated as intended 800 meters (yards) above water at a spot that simulated an unspecified “major enemy target,” supposedly reaffirming the reliability of the weapon’s nuclear explosion control devices and warhead detonators.\\nThe report said the launch was the final step of a two-day drill that also involved nuclear command and control exercises and training military units to switch more quickly into nuclear counterattack posture, properly handle nuclear weapons systems and execute attack plans.\\nThe exercise was also a “stronger warning” to the United States and South Korea, who are “undisguised in their explicit attempt to unleash a war” against the North, KCNA said.\\nPhotos published by state media showed Kim walking through a forest with his daughter and senior military officials and a missile the North described as a tactical nuclear weapon system soaring from the woods spewing flames and smoke.\\nSaying that his enemies are getting “ever more pronounced in their moves for aggression,” Kim laid out unspecified “strategic tasks” for further developing his nuclear forces and improving their war readiness, KCNA said. This indicated that the North could up the ante in its weapons demonstrations in coming weeks or months.\\nJeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said it’s clear North Korea with its ramped-up testing activity is making “considerable progress” in nuclear weapons technology but did not provide a specific assessment about the North’s claim about the successful warhead detonation.\\nNorth Korean photos indicated the latest launch was of a solid-fuel missile apparently modeled after Russia’s Iskander mobile ballistic system that the North has been testing since 2019. The missiles are built to travel at low altitudes and be maneuverable in flight, which theoretically improve their chances of evading South Korean missile defenses.\\nNorth Korea likely has dozens of nuclear warheads, but there are differing assessments on how far the North has advanced in miniaturizing and engineering those weapons so that they could fit on the newer weapons it tested in recent years.\\nWhile the North after six nuclear tests may be able to place simple nuclear warheads on some of its older systems, like Scuds or Rodong missiles, it will likely require further technology upgrades and nuclear tests to build warheads that can be installed on its newer tactical systems, according to Lee Choon Geun, an honorary research fellow at South Korea’s Science and Technology Policy Institute.\\nSunday’s short-range launch was the North’s fifth missile event this month and the third since the U.S. and South Korean militaries began joint exercises on March 13. The allies’ drills, which are to continue through Thursday, include computer simulations and their biggest springtime field exercise since 2018.\\nThe North so far in 2023 has fired around 20 missiles over nine different launch events. They included short-range missiles fired from land, cruise missiles launched from a submarine, and two different intercontinental ballistic missiles fired an airport near Pyongyang as it tries to demonstrate a dual ability to conduct nuclear attacks on South Korea and the U.S. mainland.\\nThe latest ICBM test last Thursday preceded a summit between South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who agreed to resume security dialogues and take other steps to improve their oft-strained relations in the face of North Korean threats.\\nNorth Korea already is coming off a record year in testing activity, with more than 70 missiles fired in 2022, as Kim accelerates his weapons development aimed at forcing the United States to accept the idea of the North as a nuclear power and negotiating badly needed sanctions relief from a position of strength.\\nIn response to the most recent ICBM launch, the U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency open meeting Monday morning at the request of the United States, United Kingdom, Albania, Ecuador, France and Malta. Security Council resolutions have long banned North Korean ballistic missile activity, but permanent council members Russia and China have thwarted punishment or further sanctions in recent years.\\nThe U.N. Security Council held an informal meeting Friday at which the U.S., its allies and human rights experts shone a spotlight on what they described as the dire rights situation in North Korea. China and Russia denounced the meeting as a politicized move.\\nNorth Korea’s U.N. Mission called the meeting about “our non-existent ‘human rights issue’” unlawful. It also said the U.S. held Friday’s meeting “while staging the aggressive joint military exercise which poses a grave threat to our national security.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has visited the occupied port city of Mariupol, Russian state news agencies reported Sunday, his first trip to the Ukrainian territory that Moscow illegally annexed in September.\\nEarlier, on Saturday, Putin traveled to Crimea, a short distance southwest of Mariupol, to mark the ninth anniversary of the Black Sea peninsula’s annexation from Ukraine. Mariupol became a worldwide symbol of defiance after outgunned and outmanned Ukrainian forces held out in a steel mill there for nearly three months before Moscow finally took control of it in May.\\nThe visits, during which he was shown chatting with local residents in Mariupol and visiting an art school and a children’s center in Crimea, were a show of defiance by the Russian leader two days after a court issued a warrant for his arrest on war crimes charges. Putin has not commented on the arrest warrant, which deepened his international isolation despite the unlikelihood of him facing trial anytime soon.\\nThe trip also came ahead of a planned visit to Moscow by Chinese President Xi Jinping this week, expected to provide a major diplomatic boost to Putin in his confrontation with the West.\\nPutin arrived in Mariupol by helicopter and then drove himself around the city’s “memorial sites,” concert hall and coastline, Russian news reports said, without specifying exactly when the visit took place. They said Putin also met with local residents in the city’s Nevskyi district.\\nSpeaking to the state RIA agency Sunday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Marat Khusnulin made clear that Russia was in Mariupol to stay. He said the government hoped to finish the reconstruction of its blasted downtown by the end of the year.\\n“People have started to return. When they saw that reconstruction is under way, people started actively returning,” Khusnulin told RIA.\\nWhen Moscow fully captured the city in May, an estimated 100,000 people remained out of a prewar population of 450,000. Many were trapped without food, water, heat or electricity. Relentless bombardment left rows upon rows of shattered or hollowed-out buildings.\\nMariupol’s plight first came into focus with a Russian airstrike on a maternity hospital on March 9 last year, less than two weeks after Russian troops moved into Ukraine. A week later, about 300 people were reported killed in the bombing of a theater that was serving as the city’s largest bomb shelter. Evidence obtained by the AP last spring suggested that the real death toll could be closer to 600.\\nA small group of Ukrainian fighters held out for 83 days in the sprawling Azovstal steel works in eastern Mariupol before surrendering, their dogged defense tying down Russian forces and coming to symbolize Ukrainian tenacity in the face of Moscow’s aggression.\\nRussia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, a move that most of the world denounced as illegal, and moved on last September to officially claim four regions in Ukraine’s south and east as Russian territory, following referendums that Kyiv and the West described as a sham.\\n',\n",

He said they blocked the lanes around Khan’s residence with concrete blocks, felled trees, tents and a parked truck.\\nKhan was not in the home, having traveled to Islamabad to appear before a judge to face charges he sold state gifts while in office and hid his assets. The judge postponed that hearing until March 30.\\nSukhera said baton-wielding Khan supporters attempted to resist police by throwing stones and Molotov cocktails and a man on the roof of Khan’s residence opened fire. At least three police officers were injured.\\nSukhera said police broke open the main door of Khan’s residence and found automatic weapons, Molotov cocktails, iron rods and batons used in attacks on police during the week. Sukhera said that inside the sprawling residence, illegal structures had been erected to shelter people involved in attacks on police that have injured dozens of officers.\\nInterior Minister Rana Sanaullah said later that police would do a complete search of Khan’s home, where they found bunkers and suspected more illegal weapons and ammunition were hidden. He said in Islamabad, Khan and many of his supporters were armed.\\nWitnesses in Lahore said police attempted to disperse Khan’s supporters by firing tear gas and chased them to several homes in the Zaman Park neighborhood. Khan’s lawyer appeared in an Islamabad court on Saturday after a top court Friday suspended Khan’s arrest warrant, giving him a reprieve to travel to Islamabad and face charges in the graft case without being detained.\\nKhan had been holed up at his home in Lahore since Tuesday after failing to appear at an earlier hearing in the case. His supporters hurled rocks and clashed with baton-wielding police for two days to protect the former premier from arrest.\\nKhan’s motorcade arrived Saturday near the federal judicial complex in Islamabad, where his supporters also clashed with police who prevented them from entering the complex. The enraged Khan supporters threw rocks at police who responded by lobbing tear gas canisters to disperse them.\\nKhan’s attorney, Babar Awan, filed an application for Khan’s exemption from appearance in court amid special circumstances.\\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar condemned Khan for not turning himself over to police and not appearing in court Saturday despite arriving at the judicial complex gate. He accused Khan of using his protesting supporters to avoid indictment.\\nKhan’s supporter set two police vehicles and several motorcycles outside the judicial complex on fire while dispersing, according to the law minister.\\nKhan, during his road trip to Islamabad, said in a video message that police had broken into his residence in Lahore while his wife was alone at the home. He condemned the action and demanded that those responsible be punished.\\nKhan’s PTI party secretary-general, Asad Umar, in a letter to Pakistan’s chief justice noted that police waited until Khan was en route to Islamabad to storm his Lahore residence. He said the “doors and walls have been razed to the ground” and more than 40 people at the home were arrested.\\nKhan, now the opposition leader, was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament last April. He is accused of selling state gifts while in office and concealing assets, charges he denies. It’s one in a string of cases that the former cricket star turned Islamist politician has been facing since his ouster.\\nThe 70-year-old Khan, who has called for early elections in Parliament, has claimed that his removal from power was part of a conspiracy by his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, and the United States. Both Washington and Sharif’s government have denied the allegation.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0Donald Trump claimed on Saturday that his arrest is imminent and issued an extraordinary call for his supporters to protest as a New York grand jury investigates hush money payments to women who alleged sexual encounters with the former president.\\nEven as Trump’s lawyer and spokesperson said there had been no communication from prosecutors, Trump declared in a post on his social media platform that he expects to be taken into custody on Tuesday.\\nHis message seemed designed to preempt a formal announcement from prosecutors and to galvanize outrage from his base of supporters in advance of widely anticipated charges. Within hours, his campaign was sending fundraising solicitations to his supporters, while influential Republicans in Congress and even some declared and potential rival candidates issued statements in his defense.\\nIn a later post that went beyond simply exhorting loyalists to protest about his legal peril, the 2024 presidential candidate directed his overarching ire in all capital letters at the Biden administration and raised the prospect of civil unrest: “IT’S TIME!!!” he wrote. “WE JUST CAN’T ALLOW THIS ANYMORE. THEY’RE KILLING OUR NATION AS WE SIT BACK & WATCH. WE MUST SAVE AMERICA!PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST!!!”\\nIt all evoked, in foreboding ways, the rhetoric he used shortly before the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. After hearing from the then-president at a Washington rally that morning, his supporters marched to the Capitol and tried to stop the congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s White House victory, breaking through doors and windows of the building and leaving officers beaten and bloodied.\\nDistrict Attorney Alvin Bragg is thought to be eyeing charges in the hush money investigation, and recently offered Trump a chance to testify before the grand jury. Local law enforcement officials are bracing for the public safety ramifications of an unprecedented prosecution of a former American president.\\nIn an internal email following Trump’s statements, Bragg said law enforcement would ensure that the 1,600 people who work in his office would remain safe, and that “any specific or credible threats” would be investigated.\\n“We do not tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York,” he wrote, and added: “In the meantime, as with all of our investigations, we will continue to apply the law evenly and fairly, and speak publicly only when appropriate.”\\nThere has been no public announcement of any time frame for the grand jury’s secret work in the case. At least one additional witness is expected to testify, further indicating that no vote to indict has yet been taken, according to a person familiar with the investigation who was not authorized to publicly discuss the case and spoke on condition of anonymity.\\nThat did not stop Trump from taking to his social media platform to say “illegal leaks” from Bragg’s office indicate that “THE FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WILL BE ARRESTED ON TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.”\\nA Trump lawyer, Susan Necheles, said Trump’s post was “based on the media reports,” and a spokesperson said there had been “no notification” from Bragg’s office, though the origin of Trump’s Tuesday reference was unclear. The district attorney’s office declined to comment.\\nTrump’s aides and legal team have been preparing for the possibility of an indictment. Should that happen, he would be arrested only if he refused to surrender. Trump’s lawyers have previously said he would follow normal procedure, meaning he would likely agree to surrender at a New York Police Department precinct or directly to Bragg’s office.\\nIt is unclear whether Trump’s supporters would heed his protest call or if he retains the same persuasive power he held as president. Trump’s posts on Truth Social generally receive far less attention than he used to get on Twitter, but he maintains a deeply loyal base. The aftermath of the Jan. 6 riot, in which hundreds of Trump loyalists were arrested and prosecuted in federal court, may also have dampened the passion among supporters for confrontation.\\nThe indictment of Trump, 76, would be an extraordinary development after years of investigations into his business, political and personal dealings.\\nEven as Trump pursues his latest White House campaign — his first rally is set for Waco, Texas, later this month and he shook hands and took selfies with fans during a public appearance Saturday evening at the NCAA Division I wrestling championships in Tulsa, Oklahoma — there is no question an indictment would be a distraction and give fodder to opponents and critics tired of the legal scandals that have long enveloped him.\\nBesides the hush money inquiry in New York, Trump faces separate criminal investigations in Atlanta and Washington over his efforts to undo the results of the 2020 election.\\nA Justice Department special counsel has also been presenting evidence before a grand jury investigating Trump’s possession of hundreds of classified documents at his Florida estate. It is not clear when those investigations will end or whether they might result in criminal charges, but they will continue regardless of what happens in New York, underscoring the ongoing gravity – and broad geographic scope – of the legal challenges facing the former president.\\nTrump’s post Saturday echoes one made last summer when he broke the news on Truth Social that the FBI was searching his Florida home as part of an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified documents.\\nNews of that search sparked a flood of contributions to Trump’s political operation, and on Saturday, Trump sent out a series of fundraising emails to his supporters, including one that claimed, “I’m not worried in the slightest.”\\nAfter his post, Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy decried any plans to prosecute Trump as an “outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA” whom he claimed was pursuing “political vengeance.” Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, issued a statement with a similar sentiment.\\nThe grand jury has been hearing from witnesses, including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who says he orchestrated payments in 2016 to two women to silence them about sexual encounters they said they had with Trump a decade earlier.\\nTrump denies the encounters occurred, says he did nothing wrong and has cast the investigation as a “witch hunt” by a Democratic prosecutor bent on sabotaging the Republican’s 2024 campaign. Trump also has labeled Bragg, who is Black, a “racist” and has accused the prosecutor of letting crime in the city run amok while he has focused on Trump. New York remains one of the safest cities in the country.\\nBragg’s office has apparently been examining whether any state laws were broken in connection with the payments or the way Trump’s company compensated Cohen for his work to keep the women’s allegations quiet.\\nPorn actor Stormy Daniels and at least two former Trump aides — onetime political adviser Kellyanne Conway and former spokesperson Hope Hicks — are among witnesses who have met with prosecutors in recent weeks.\\nCohen has said that at Trump’s direction, he arranged payments totaling $280,000 to Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. According to Cohen, the payouts were to buy their silence about Trump, who was then in the thick of his first presidential campaign.\\nCohen and federal prosecutors said Trump’s company paid him $420,000 as reimbursement for the $130,000 payment to Daniels and to cover bonuses and other supposed expenses. The company classified those payments internally as legal expenses. The $150,000 payment to McDougal was made by the then-publisher of the supermarket tabloid National Enquirer, which kept her story from coming to light.\\nFederal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute the Enquirer’s corporate parent in exchange for its cooperation in a campaign finance investigation that led to charges against Cohen in 2018. Prosecutors said the payments to Daniels and McDougal amounted to impermissible, unrecorded gifts to Trump’s election effort.\\nCohen pleaded guilty, served prison time and was disbarred. Federal prosecutors never charged Trump with any crime.\\nNews that law enforcement agencies were preparing for a possible indictment was first reported by NBC News.\\n',\n",

Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.\\nLamichhane also revealed that Shrestha threatened the party’s discipline committee to finish RSP if he were punished. “He has been repeatedly changing his version. His guilt was proven also because the audio was recorded in January.

But neither have they initiated any action against Pandey, nor has Mayor Balen Shah taken any steps in this regard.\\nDeputy Mayor Dangol, who is also the coordinator of KMC’s judicial committee, has the authority to take action on the matter. But she has shirked her responsibility saying she has not received any application.\\n“Yes, I heard such things from the media but I have not received any application. What am I supposed to do unless the victim files an application?” Dangol said.\\nIt has been nearly two weeks since it came to light that Pandey had abused Upreti with foul language and caused her mental stress. Another KMC employee also confirmed it.\\nKMC should have investigated the matter and provided justice to the victim after being informed about the abuse of a female employee at the workplace. But KMC officials have not taken any action yet even though Upreti’s application to the administrative officer was registered on November 27.\\nUpreti, who has been with the City Police since 2016, is a permanent employee. She was on maternity leave from February to May. After she returned to work, she was assigned duty at the KMC’s office in Teku as it is easier for female employees there than elsewhere.\\nIn October, Upreti was informed that she had been transferred to the task force division of City Police at Bag Durbar. Upreti went to inform Pandey that she would not be able to work at Bag Durbar due to her health as it would be difficult for her to do physically exhausting work such as lifting heavy loads after surgery. KMC was removing unauthorized structures, vacating encroached public land and removing street vendors at the time.\\nBut Pandey told her to keep her domestic problems to herself and even ordered her to do 12-hour duties or resign if she couldn’t do that, Upreti has written in her complaint.\\nShe then went to the task force division for four days during which she had to do physically demanding work such as lifting or carrying heavy objects, and as a result she suffered bleeding from the operated area of her stomach. The doctor also advised her against lifting heavy loads and doing difficult work. She then took leave for a few days.\\nUpreti told the duty in-charge about her problem after she felt a little better. The duty in-charge told her that he would arrange for her to work in the office itself. But Pandey did not agree to it, and Upreti could not go to work outside.\\nPandey started calling Upreti to his room every day after that. He would tell her to do her duty if there were other people around. If there was no one around, he would abuse her with foul language. Upreti had started feeling scared as Pandey’s abuses grew, and she was also mentally stressed.\\nOne day Pandey called her again. She told him that she would not be able to go to work outside as it was difficult for her to even breastfeed her baby due to her health. But Pandey told her to leave her child at home if she wanted to work or else resign.\\nUpreti could not even go to the office for the next few days. She received a call on September 30 asking her to report to the office, so she went with her husband and child.\\nAs soon as Pandey saw Upreti, he told her to resign if she wanted to come to work with her baby and started verbally abusing her. He also manhandled Upreti’s husband, who was recording the incident on his mobile phone, and snatched his phone.\\nPandey kept the phone with him for a month. Upreti has written in her application that she got the phone back only on November 3.\\nThe application also states that Pandey had initiated action to freeze Upreti’s salary after deleting evidence against him from the phone.\\nMeanwhile, Pandey has said that all the allegations leveled against him are baseless and false. \"I am a person who always raises voice about women empowerment. This is all an attempt to derail our work. If it was true, she would have spoken about it in the media,\" he said.\\nA KMC employee close to Upreti said that she waited in the belief that she would get justice from Deputy Mayor Dangol.\\n“We had told Ganga to speak about this matter but she waited in the hope that she would receive justice if action was taken on her application.

       "  '\\n                            Actor Irrfan Khan is a Bollywood star and Hollywood chameleon, who has bounced between the two with ease for decades, working with everyone from Mira Nair to Wes Anderson and Ang Lee and stealing scenes in both Oscar-winners (“Slumdog Millionaire”) and blockbusters (“Jurassic World”) alike. But all that’s been put on hold as he undergoes treatment in London for a neuroendocrine tumor, a rare form of cancer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough Khan’s life now is very different from only a few months ago, he still has films that he worked on as recently last year coming out, including “Puzzle,” a poignant character drama expanding to 11 cities this weekend.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe indie film from Oscar-nominated producer Marc Turtletaub (“Little Miss Sunshine”) is about a stifled suburban housewife, played by Kelly Macdonald, who forms a bond with a more cosmopolitan man, (Khan), over a shared fondness for puzzles. It’s one that the 56-year-old actor is immensely proud of, and eager to talk about, but, he also knows very keenly how unpredictable his life has become.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I call him for our interview, he answers politely and informs me that he’s been hospitalized the night prior and asks if might be possible to call him back in 10 minutes. Of course, I say. This happens again, when Khan’s doctors come in to talk to him and he politely asks if we might pick it up tomorrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow are excerpts from our conversations. They have been edited for clarity and brevity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: ‘Puzzle’ is quite lovely, but also a small character drama — a bit of a departure from the bigger Hollywood films you’ve become known for\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: I was looking for something for a long time in American cinema, Hollywood cinema. I have been reaching for this, for a personal experience where I could invest myself and I could have more meat that I could get apart from myself completely and get into something which is unknown. This character had complexity and a strange unpredictability where he himself doesn’t know where things are moving and is in a limbo state. There are so many interesting angles to this person. I was looking for something more personal and to redefine my involvement in a story, where my soul could entangle with this story. You want residue, you want it to last. So it had all that. And the simplicity of writing was fantastic. It was a complex situation, but I love that the way it comes out of the characters’ mouths is very simple. So I fell in love it with it and I shifted my schedule in India and said, “I’m going to do it.” It worked out and I really loved it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: How are you doing in general?\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: I’ve seen life from a completely different angle. You sit down and you see the other side and that’s fascinating. I’m engaged on a journey.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: There’s been a lot of speculation in the media about your condition and you’ve made pleas on social media not to trust the reports. But what do you want people to know about what you’re going through?\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: There are challenges which life throws at you. But I have started believing in the way this condition has tested me, really, really tested me in all aspects — physical, emotional and spiritual. It has put me in a rapture state. Initially I was shaken. I didn’t know. I was very, very vulnerable. But slowly, there is another way to look at things that is much more powerful and much more productive and much more healthy and I just want people to believe that nature is much more trustworthy and one must trust that. The problem with me initially was everyone was speculating whether I would be out of this disease or not. Because it’s not in my hand. That’s nature that will do whatever it has to do. What is in my hand, I could take care of that. And it offers so much that you feel thankful. The way it is opening your windows to look at life. I would have never reached that state even if I had done meditation for 30 years, I wouldn’t have reached it. But this sudden jolt has put me into a platform where I could look at things in a completely different manner. And for that I am really thankful. It sounds strange, but they should trust nature rather than feel sad, and trust that whatever the outcome, it will be for good and it will be for the best.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: What is your day to day like now? Are you reading scripts or planning to work at all?\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: No, I’m completely out of reading scripts. This has become a surreal experience. My days are unpredictable. I used to think my life would be like that, but I could never practice unpredictability and spontaneity. That has happened now. I don’t plan. I go for breakfast and then I don’t have a plan. I take things as they come. That has been really helping me a lot. I don’t make plans. I’m just spontaneous. And I’m loving this experience. There was something missing in my life. I was feeling a little manipulated by myself, by my own mind. There was a kind of disharmony in myself. It was bothering me. And I think this is what I was missing, this spontaneity. I know because we live in a world that is packed with plans, it sounds unrealistic. How could you live your life like that? But life is so mysterious and has so much to offer, we don’t really try things. And I’m trying and I’m loving it. I’m in a really fortunate state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: You’re in London going through treatments. Is there anything you can share about that?\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: I have had the fourth cycle of chemo. And I have to have six cycles and then we need to have a scan. After the third cycle, the scan was positive. But we need to see after the sixth scan. And then we’ll see where it takes me. There’s no guarantee of life with anybody. My mind could always tell me to hang a kind of chip on your neck and say, “I have this disease and I could die in a few months or a year or two.” Or I could just avoid this conversation completely and live my life the way it offers me. And it offers so much. I admit I was walking around with blinders. I couldn’t see what it offered me.\\r\\n\\r\\nAP: So there is some sort of clarity with this experience?\\r\\n\\r\\nKHAN: Exactly, and clarity came like lightning. You stop your contemplation, you stop your planning, you stop the noise. You see the other aspect of it. It gives you so much. Life offers you so much. That’s why I feel like I have no other words but thanks. There are no other words, there’s no other demand, there’s no other prayer.\\n',\n",

So I said what are you talking about? \\'I was always very certain about her and as I said this woman never made a mistake twice,\" Guha is quoted in the biography by Aseem Chhabra.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe contestants faced a range of celebrity judges - actors Shah Rukh Khan, Juhi Chawla and Waheeda Rehman, cricketer Mohammed Azharuddin, media mogul and film producer Pritish Nandy, painter Anjolie Ela Menon, the then founder-chairman of Zee Media (and now Rajya Sabha MP) Subhash Chandra, fashion designer and perfume queen Carolina Herrera, and Marcus Swarovski, the great-great-grand nephew of the founder of the Austrian crystal company.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"She kind of always improved on herself day on day, day on day.

I think she wasn\\'t quite sure initially whether this was the thing she wanted to do. She came in a bit tentatively. By the time the contest started she seemed a lot more collected and definitely more confident of herself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the reason Priyanka felt unsure was because she was an outsider, as compared to some of the other contestants, including Lara who was already a professional model, Guha says.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother mentor, Sathya Saran, says she remembers Priyanka because they did not notice her in the beginning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I noticed her at the talent contest, because she sang beautifully.

He said in a statement late Friday that the report has devastated him and that “it is not right to equate horrific incidents of sexual assault with misplaced compliments or humor.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFollowing the report, Visa announced it was suspending all of its marketing that features the actor’s voice.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN’s story includes one movie production assistant who said Freeman unsuccessfully tried to lift her skirt. Other women talked about unwanted touching on their backs and shoulders. Mostly, Freeman’s accusers say he would comment about their bodies or clothes or make them uncomfortable by staring. A male former employee of Freeman’s production company said the 80-year-old actor would behave like a “creepy uncle.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the article’s authors, Chloe Melas, began working on it following a press junket where she said Freeman clasped her hand, looked her up and down and made comments like, “you are ripe.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I admit that I am someone who feels a need to try to make women, and men, feel appreciated and at ease around me,” Freeman said. “As a part of that, I would often try to joke with and compliment women, in what I thought was a light-hearted and humorous way. Clearly I was not always coming across the way I intended.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said that he did not assault women, create unsafe work environments or offer employment or advancement in exchange for sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis reference to equating his behavior with others was unclear. The accusations against Freeman came out the same day word spread that New York City authorities were filing rape charges against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman’s statement was reminiscent of an email written by longtime television anchor Tom Brokaw sent to friends recently after a former colleague had accused him of unwanted sexual advances.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I am devastated that 80 years of my life is at risk of being undermined, in the blink of an eye, by Thursday’s media reports,” Freeman said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman won the 2005 Oscar for best supporting actor for “Million Dollar Baby.” He was nominated four other times, including for “Driving Miss Daisy” and “The Shawshank Redemption.” His voice is familiar on commercials and as a narrator for documentaries and other productions.\\n',\n",

He didn’t respond to shouts of “Harvey!”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exact charges against Weinstein still had not been made public early Friday.

I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.”\\r\\n\\r\\nManhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance had been under enormous public pressure to bring a criminal case against Weinstein.

Andrew Cuomo took the extraordinary step of ordering the state’s attorney general to investigate whether Vance acted properly in 2015 when he decided not to prosecute Weinstein over a previous allegation of unwanted groping, made by an Italian model. That investigation is in its preliminary stages.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than 75 women have accused Weinstein of wrongdoing around the globe. Several actresses and models accused him of criminal sexual assaults, but many of the encounters happened too long ago for any prosecution.

Because it’s all true. None of this was consensual.”\\r\\n\\r\\nThe statute of limitations for rape and certain other sex crimes in New York was eliminated in 2006, but not for attacks that happened prior to 2001.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew York City police detectives said in early November that they were investigating allegations by another accuser, “Boardwalk Empire” actress Paz de la Huerta, who told police in October that Weinstein raped her twice in 2010. She is not one of the victims in the case on Friday; hers was still pending, officials said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAuthorities in California and London also are investigating assault allegations. Britain has no statute of limits on rape cases; some of the allegations under investigation there date to the 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarvey and his brother Bob Weinstein started his now-bankrupt company after leaving Miramax, the company they founded in 1979 and which became a powerhouse in ’90s indie film with hits like “Pulp Fiction” and “Shakespeare in Love.” The Weinstein Co. found success with Oscar winners “The Artist” and “The King’s Speech.”\\n',\n",

The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions.

Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy.

       "  \"\\n‘Coronavirus exposes the idiocy of Islamophobia’, writes Mehdi Hassan, an Aljazeera journalist based in Washington DC. This precisely captures what is happening in India and Nepal when it comes about Islamophobic approach of looking at COVID-19. The Indian media and government tirelessly blamed Muslims for the infection as if Tablighi Jamaat is the only reason behind this pandemic. Some folks here in Nepal as well tried to give a communal angle to the virus. Nevertheless, Muslims are greatly thankful to the Nepal government as it did not point fingers on them. However, it is sad that it did nothing to make those spewing hatred accountable.\\nLet me assert in the very beginning that I am not defending the Jamaat in any way whatsoever. I am just trying to deconstruct the convoluted case of Tablighi Jamaat and connect various dots that explain how we came here and point out the way ahead to avoid any collateral damage.\\nNepal was grappling with its own inadequacies to address the pandemic and then the Indian TV channels claimed a Nepali Muslim engineering to export more than 200 COVID-19 infected Muslims India with intention to spread the virus there. The irony died many a deaths as the total confirmed cases in Nepal were still in single digits till then. Then came the rumor of two Muslim women in Janakpur throwing paper money with their spits on it so that they can spread the virus. Later, the respective administration clears that the money just fell from their possession and they did not have any such ill-intention and also, they are not infected. These two events are clearly part of systematic efforts to demonize Muslims.\\nThen comes the case of Udayapur where some people belonging to Tablighi Jamaat, who according to media reports are Indian citizens, tested positive. They were found in a mosque, a place where they usually live, and were termed as ‘hiding’ there. Let me tell you, in the days to come some more people from Tablighi Jamaat who are not Nepali citizens may be found stuck somewhere in Nepal and they might even be carrying the virus. Are these people terrorists who are engaged in a holy war using the weapon of virus? Such superficial judgment is not in the best interest of anyone. Nuanced understanding of the entire idea of the Jamaat is essential before jumping to any hasty conclusion. Let me explain why.\\xa0\\nFirst let me give a brief introduction of what Tablighi Jamaat is. This is an organization that came into being some 100 years ago and now has its presence in more than 150 countries. The aim of the organization was to bring Muslims on the true path of Islam which still remains the same after 100 years. The Jamaat adheres to ideology of Hanafi school of thought with the chief tutor being Darul Uloom Deoband, the largest Madrasa in India and probably in the South Asia. When you look at the number of people who are on the move at any given point of time, you will realize the Jamaat is the largest Muslim proselyting organization in today’s time. Devotees join the Jamaat so that they can preach the Muslims. They travel metropolitan cities like London and New York and you can spot them carrying essential items on their shoulders reaching the remotest parts of any country where they can trace Muslims. But these preachers are not employees who are paid to be doing the job of preaching. The United States Institute of Peace describes them as ‘nebulous collection of loosely affiliated, itinerate jamaats(participants)’.\\nThe organization managed to stay away from any controversy as they claimed to remain absolutely ‘apolitical’ in their orientation and completely ‘neutral’ toward all the socio-political organizations and events. Sometimes, their extreme neutrality frustrates the people from every side. Like, they demonstrated an utter silence at time of Babri Masjid demolition and in its aftermath. Their neutrality had indeed frustrated Muslims. Likewise, it is claimed that in their congregations in Pakistan even people with radical orientations do take part. They do not do anything to stop them from participating. They believe one day their preaching will bring those people on the right paths of Islam and they will give up their bad behaviors including the radicalism.This neutrality frustrates the global security agencies at times and this makes some policy makers accuse the organization of being a gateway to radicalism. However the research by USIP nullifies the claims of the organization’s links with any militancy. In fact, the key method that they employ is to never engage in Jihad that indulges in killing people rather pursue Jihad with the evil within the self (Jiahd-bin-nafs).\\nFor most of you, an organization of this gigantic size, their orientation and the remarkable skills to work locally did not exist just a month ago. You also did not know that the bearded person alongside Narendra Modi in 2014, Zafar Sareshwala, belongs to Tablighi Jamaat. Also, you are not aware that Mahmood Madani, the only Maulana who supported India’s contentious Citizenship Amendment Act, is somebody Tablighi Jamaat unquestionably stands behind. Do you think the world’s most sophisticated electoral machine has these picks randomly? It may surprise you that when it comes about Muslims, Tablighi Jamaat was the only entity both the governments of India and Pakistan adored. Imran Khan’s election campaign had specific slogans that targeted to influence this particular ideology. In fact, this reality takes him to the quandary of whether to lock down mosques or let them open. Eventually he succumbed to the pressure and permitted the mosques to remain open during the Ramadan, just days away.\\nThere are two reasons that let the organization continue with their job across the world and you never heard of it: they exclusively preach Muslims with the quest of making them purer. The second, they are categorically against Jihad and any kind of killing or violence and they have no political aspirations. In fact when in 1949 India was considering to ban RSS it also mulled about banning Tablighi Jamaat. On this, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, India’s freedom fighter and first education minister of Independent India, said, ‘yeh log (Tablighi Jamaat) zameen se neeche aur aasman se ooper ke baat karte hain. Inse kisiko koi khatra nahin hai [these people either talk of Allah and his power or they talk of life after death. No one has to feel any threat from them].' It became apparent that not only India and Pakistan saw them through this lens the entire world institutions responsible for global governance saw them from this prism.\\nThough Tablighi Jamaat have been a loved child for many governments but various Muslim groups have seen them differently. Two years ago their institution, Deoband, distanced from Jamaat when Jamaat undermined the importance of education in attaining leadership. Maualan Wahiduddin Khan, arguably one of the most consequential Muslim intellectual, today, once quipped, ‘the Jamaat’s initial aim was to make Muslims of Mewat (who were tribal people) real Muslims. Now they are trying to make the entire Muslim community Mewatis.' Saudi Arabia did not like their methods to the extent that on 13th February 2020 its Ministry of religious affairs notified all the Imams of mosques to denounce the methods of Tablighi Jamaat in Friday sermon. A noted Indian historian Irfan Habib calls TabilghiJamaat ‘an enemy of Islam’.\\nWhen the world gets inflicted with the misery of COVID-19 the organization was on, as usual, its mission and its nebulous preachers were scattered in every corner of the world’s more than 150 countries busy bringing their Muslim brethren on the true path of Islam. The international community missed to spot an organization like this and to alarm them. Let’s admit, barring a few exceptions no country was taking the virus seriously. The fact that the organization does not entertain scholarship and intellectuality, they even failed to comprehend what they were preaching. Otherwise, they would have known that Prophet Muhammad has very definitely asked ‘when a plague happens in a settlement don’t enter in that and don’t come out of that’. Also the prophet didn’t shake hand with a person who was enduring infectious diseases. Their lack of knowledge of Islam becomes extremely evident when amidst this COVID-19 crisis they created a binary between the virus and Allah and left everything on the wishes of Allah. They didn’t know that once when the prophet was travelling with a companion and when they were taking rest the companion left his camel free. The prophet asked, why did not you tie the camel? ‘Allah will take care of it’, replied the companion. On this prophet said, ‘first tie your camel and then trust Allah’. Likewise, the vocabulary of Azaan that calls people to come to prayer to the mosque had been amended during the times of incessant rains so that worshippers don’t face hardship. These were the very underlying reasons countries in the Middle East locked down mosques as soon as pandemic emerged. Azaan vocabularies amended which now says ‘pray in your homes’.\\nThe way people—both Muslims and non-Muslims—are \\xa0reacting to the whole issue of Tablighi Jamaat makes me laugh as well as pains me. This reminds me of a piece by Hamid Dabashi where he had called some of the most highly consequential intellectuals like Richard Dawkins,\\xa0Sam Harris ‘literally illiterate’ about Islam and Muslims. The whole episode of Tablighi Jamaat—from stupid and extremely irresponsible behavior of Tablighi Jamaat to continue with their preaching job to the indiscriminate demonizing of Muslims reflects the same.\\nIrrefutably the decisions to continue with their congregations in various parts of the world was not only irresponsible but was callous and criminal. Any quest of defending the event by citing any other event is futile as two wrongs never make a right. This takes us to some pondering. Had the Tablighi Jamaat known Islam they would have called off their events way before the World Health Organization (WHO) called the COVID-19 a pandemic. If the Islamophobes know even a fraction of what Tablighi Jamaat is, they would not have brought them as a fodder to their Islamophobia. If the states recognize the social cost the society is going to bear due to this indiscriminate dehumanization of Muslims they would have dealt with these Islamophobes in the stringent way possible. Too much illiteracy gave birth to this organization and its flourishing. Too much illiteracy around it is leading it toward another disaster. Plausibly they are terrified and distressed. Efforts should be made to make them feel comfortable so that they come out and report. If there are people from the Jamaat who still believe that they don’t need any medical help and Allah will do best for them, they are without any ifs and buts the enemies of humanity, Islam and Muslims, and must be punished stringently. Blaming them will make them stay indoors. Blaming them at this time of crisis will have longer consequences as the Jamaat has been implicitly seen as an antidote to all the Islamic extremism. Their stupidity and irresponsible behavior being called out as ‘Corona Jihad’ is in extremely bad taste and lacks any futuristic approach.\\n(Mohd Ayub is a researcher based in Kathmandu who focuses on issues of development, globalization, and labor migration)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nIn any outbreak of a new disease, information emerges slowly and rumors are rife. Knowledge and understanding of how to avoid the infection and also what treatments may work against it become apparent slowly over time. Often though it is helpful to look at how similar diseases behave.\\nCOVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-COV-2 virus. A great deal has been written about COVID-19 \\xa0but one area that hasn’t been discussed much in the popular media is the idea of viral load.This is the concept that suggests the amount or actual number of virus particles that invade a body have an impact of how badly a person will suffer from the disease.\\nA familiar viral infection is chickenpox. Many of us will have suffered from chickenpox as children and although this was unpleasant at the time, the symptoms departed and we were left immune.\\nOne fascinating fact about chickenpox is that usually the severity of the diseases varies greatly within a family. The first child to develop it is often only mildly unwell. They will have 24 hours of fever and few pox on their skins. The next child in the family will experience worse symptoms and the third worse still. This worsening of symptoms with each successive case within the family is connected with viral load.\\nThe first child to have the disease will probably have inhaled some virus particles at school and because few viruses entered that child’s body, the immune system fights it with some success. When that ‘index case’ shares air within the house with siblings, they will inhale frequent ‘doses’ of viruses.Then as more than one sibling is affected there will be a lot of virus floating around in the home.\\nIn the case of COVID-19, it is thought that most people are the most ill around day five or six after exposure to the victim. This is also the time when a patient will probably be coughing out a lot of virus particles. This may be the time when the patient will visit a doctor or be admitted to hospital.\\nIt is likely that people working in hospitals, therefore, will be exposed repeatedly to lots of virus particles. This might explain why doctors, nurses and health care workers are among the people who have sadly died from the infection during this pandemic.\\nThe concept of social distancing then is very important because if we avoid close contact with people (the WHO suggests at least a meter distance; further is even better) we are less likely to encounter someone with COVID-19 and, if we do, we are unlikely to inhale or swallow a large numbers of virus particles. This should help ensure that the disease, when it strikes, is mild.\\nA couple of weeks ago, a friend of a friend in the UK returned from a trip to Italy. This was when the pandemic was very bad there so – very responsibly – he isolated himself at home. He needed some materials from his office, though, and went to work one evening after everyone had gone home. Some days later he tested positive for COVID-19. A week or so later my friend developed a sore throat. She worked at the desk next to the person who had just returned from Italy; this friend also tested positive. Happily, she recovered in just three days and her husband didn’t get any symptoms at all.\\nIt seems to me that this is a situation where the friend acquired the infection from one of the hard surfaces at the office but swallowed so few virus particles that she effectively immunised herself without getting especially ill.\\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum of illness in England are the young people in London who have become very ill from COVID-19. It was first thought that healthy young adults were not at risk from the disease so some people felt that this meant that they could continue to go out, use the underground train services and go clubbing. The air in crowded trains and night clubs tends to be stagnant and shared with lots of people so that these would be perfect environments for acquiring lots of virus.\\nMicroorganisms that invade our bodies and cause disease need to bypass our defence mechanisms. Many will either be inhaled or swallowed; a few are spread by direct contact – skin to skin.\\xa0 Unfortunately SARS-COV-2 is able to pass from a victim to someone else both through the air (so-called aerosol spread) as well as by being swallowed. It is difficult to avoid disease-causing organisms that are coughed out by a victim and then inhaled, except through social isolation and distancing. It is easier, though, to avoid transferring virus into the mouth (or perhaps the eyes) by thinking about how virus might get there. Since the virus can live on hard surfaces for at least 72 hours, consider what happens if you touch a surface that has been coughed on. Then you put a hand to your face and thus transfer infection. There is also evidence that the virus is excreted with faeces too so it continues to be crucial to practise good personal hygiene especially after trips to the toilet.\\nThis is why we are being constantly reminded to avoid shaking hands with people and also to wash our hands with plenty of soap and water frequently. Alcohol gels are useful but do not clean nearly as well as proper hand-washing.\\nHere in Nepal, we are waiting and watching, and wondering when COVID-19 will arrive and start making a lot of us ill. There is a great deal we can all do to help reduce the impact of the virus mostly by paying careful attention to the sensible measures that the government is instituting. We must also listen to and act on the messages on posters, on our phones and on the media.\\nLet’s act responsible, keep our distance and protect the vulnerable by avoiding crowding together, even at home. Gathering together – even for good reasons – for pujas, weddings, funerals and festivals just has to be put on hold, though not for long most probably. Then, let’s hope that when this pandemic sweeps through the country most of us will then escape serious illness.\\nIt is hard to really know the extent and effects of the pandemic, where we cannot know how many people have been infected and testing is patchy. But I take great comfort in what happened on the cruise ship the Diamond Princess. The people on board were quarantined, tested and 712 contracted COVID-19. Of these 98.5% recovered, and yet this was in an older population where one might expect the outcome to be much worse. Any death is a disaster for the bereaved family and friends but a 98.5% survival rate sounds a lot more positive than the impression we get from the media and the press.\\n(Dr Jane Wilson-Howarth is a British physician who has lived in Nepal for about nine years over the last 25 years or so.

       "  '\\nCountries like South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan have been relatively successful in the fight against \\xa0coronavirus primarily because they were proactive in controlling it at an early stage, applying the nip in the bud strategy. The Italians and the Spanish ignored it and the virus started to spread at an exponential rate.\\xa0 In the United States, political distrust and polarization have been a defining character of the national politics since the last few years stymieing efforts to formulate a coherent set of policies against the disease to the extent that the states and the federal government cannot yet agree on the best way of battling the disease.\\nBasically aggressive defensive measures against the virus were ignored.\\xa0 Once\\xa0 it gained strength and went on a rampage both \\xa0preventive and curative strategies have been employed but \\xa0the cost \\xa0in human lives and economic distress have been staggering with grave implications for the livelihood of millions of people in the future.\\xa0\\nIn case of China, the government ignored the virus at an early stage but quickly reformulated its strategy and adopted a combination of \\xa0both aggressive preventive and curative measures with a steely determination to implement the nip in the bud doctrine. It was not easy because the disease was already taking\\xa0 roots in Wuhan\\xa0 but the resolve of the government and the people paid off. The results so far have\\xa0 been encouraging and there are reasons to hope that the virus will be completely eliminated. Nevertheless the human cost has run into the thousands and the economy \\xa0has been badly shaken. It will probably take about six months to \\xa0a year to rebound again assuming that there is no second wave of the virus in the fall.\\nThe crisis in Nepal\\nNepal seems to have been aware of the threat of coronavirus. Almost three months ago the health ministry floated a tender for medical supplies as part of preparation to counter the virus. But it is now clear that the initiative was not part of a carefully thought out strategic\\xa0 plan of keeping the country safe from the disease. No preventive measures were visualized\\xa0 nor were\\xa0 curative strategies or a combination of preventive and curative strategies formulated to combat it successfully. The financial and economic implications under possible scenarios were not even thought of. Once the tender was floated the government kept quiet for over two months even though it knew what was happening in China and the rest of the world.\\nOnce the first few coronavirus cases were reported in the press, the government\\xa0\\xa0 was suddenly hyperactive. It ignored the old tender and gave the responsibility of importing goods from China to company with no prior experience of importing medical supplies within a span of 24 hours on the ground that it was now an emergency. The price quoted was three or more times higher than what was available in the Chinese market. Gradually it became clear that the reason the Health Ministry ignored tenders floated months ago was because it wanted to avoid the normal government procurement rules. This was possible only when an emergency situation was present. \\xa0\\nThe government-favored company did bring less than ten tons of supplies but many items were substandard even though the price was many times higher than that quoted by other suppliers. This blatant attempt to swindle from the state coffers even at a time of national crisis has been disgusting and heavily criticized by the general public. Amid heavy criticism, the prime minister (PM) had to cancel the deal if his government was to be regarded as more that a bunch of thugs\\xa0\\xa0 determined to make money at any cost. However, no one believes that any action will be taken beyond this step for the simple reason that a decision of this nature could not have been taken without the involvement of the high and the mighty in the system. In a democracy there is equality before the law but \"some are more equal than others\" goes a saying. And this seems to be the undeclared value system in the country irrespective of what is written in the Constitution.\\nThe need for leadership\\nIn the mean time, the government has taken one positive and welcome decision and that is the lockdown adopted as part of a preventive strategy; however this in itself is not enough. The lockdown policy has the support of the people but it may not achieve the desired results if it is not viewed as a part of a broader strategy with different interlocking components. The\\xa0 major components are: (a) increasing testing for COVID-19, (b) tracking those who could have been\\xa0 infected (c) treating the suspected either through quarantine or hospitalization (d) organizing the production and supply chain (e)\\xa0 minimizing the damage to the economy (f) and protecting\\xa0 the interests of the poor and the downtrodden.\\nAll these six components require centralized policy-making and decentralized execution with a high degree of \\xa0coordination, accountability, transparency and\\xa0 participation of the concerned institutions at all levels without any political discrimination or electoral consideration.\\nThe coronavirus crisis calls for a government that is intolerant of corruption, unwilling to play the game of partisan politics and committed to achieving results under a strategic plan that relies on a mixed aggressive preventive cum curative strategy to defeat the disease and save the economy. Above all, it requires leadership that people can look up to and trust.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nWe have a government that has, technically, the mandate of the people for five years. Its performance during the last two years has been disappointing to say the least but now the PM has the chance for course correction. This\\xa0 time of national crisis is also an opportunity for him to prove that he is a man of integrity, courage \\xa0and character who\\xa0 can rise above partisan politics while\\xa0 taking action even against his closest colleagues who are incompetent, corrupt and are out to exploit the people.\\nThis is a tall order and in view of the performance of the government during the last two years there are ample reasons to be skeptical. On the other hand, it is worth remembering that it is at times of crisis that leadership is most needed. If he fails this time, I doubt if he ever will get another opportunity in the future.\\n(The writer is the president of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPunitaRimal\\nDr. Shyam P Lohani\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has resulted, as of April 14, more than 1.9 million cases worldwide with nearly 120,000 deaths. Among them, more than 1.3 million cases are still active of which 1,305,893 (96%) cases in mild condition and the remaining 4% in serious or critical condition. There were 567, 522 closed cases of which 447, 821 (79%) recovered/discharged and the remaining 21% succumbed to death (Worldometers.info).\\nMany countries have strict lockdown in place, others maintain or extend lockdown and still, others are planning to ease lockdown partly despite the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation in favor of continuing lockdown. There are benefits of easing lockdown in some parts of society.\\nCurrent Scenario\\nDespite the fear that another wave may hit hard with thousands of deaths, most hard-hit countries in Europe are planning to lift restrictions. Italy, after the current lockdown expires on Tuesday, will allow some additional businesses to open. Denmark and Norway will reopen kindergartens and schools from the next week. Austria is planning to reopen smaller businesses this week. One of the hardest-hit countries, Spain, is planning to ease restriction on some, even, nonessential workers to return to work although their new case finding has decreased significantly from the middle of March to now.\\nThe hardest-hit country in the Middle East, Iran, is opening up government offices, shops, services, and manufacturing industries in phases. The logic behind the phase-wise lift is that the economy and government activities must continue with physical distancing still being observed. The first epicenter, Wuhan of China, has ended its lockdown. India has extended the nationwide lockdown until May 3. The new measures such as to halt the air traffic by Israel after their mandatory quarantine period and temperature checks were violated at Ben Gurion Airport and order of a two-day curfew for 31 provinces by Turkey.\\nMost infections do not take place in supermarkets or restaurants in the world. They may take place at risky places such as hospitals, especially in the Intensive Care Units (ICU).\\xa0 There have been a plethora of evidence that the virus gets transmitted from the surfaces of door handles, smartphones or other objects (e.g. paper money). Mass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus to get transmitted; where strangers meet, at will, with other strangers. The mass event that occurred in New York is a perfect example of how coronavirus spread among its citizens. Religious gatherings have also been found to spread corona.\\nLet me simplify it, assume we have 100 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus and, then for example 10 get the new infections.\\xa0 After the incubation period, they may pass it on to their families and colleagues and then assume each transmits to multiple persons. Within a few days, the virus can thus get multiplied by 100 times with the only single at the beginning and then continue. This is how the virus gets multiplied exponentially. Out of 100, say only 20% developed symptoms and are quarantined or treated in isolation and the other 80 remained either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. Those who remain asymptomatic are the potential carrier and transmit the virus to others.\\nClustered lockdown should be practiced in which all those potential points of transmission are blocked such as crowded restaurants, cinema halls, sports events and mass transport systems, etc. The borders should be sealed and only transports that carry essential goods are allowed through the border with precaution.\\nWay Forward\\nThe general public is allowed with restrictions to perform their work. People should follow all the precautionary measures such as wearing a face mask, washing hands frequently with soap and water, using sanitizer, cleaning surfaces frequently such as doorknobs, handles, or other objects that support retention of viruses and a potential source of transmission to human.\\xa0 The offices, industries, schools, and colleges (where physical distancing can be implemented) taking precautionary measures should be allowed to open and other places, even restaurant but not party venues and cinema halls (closed spaces) should remain closed.\\nImmediate relief such as groceries and medicines should be distributed continuously as and when needed for identified needy individuals or families. The government should provide compensation in terms of tax rebate; banks should ease installments and cut interest to all service industries (private schools, colleges, etc.) as well as to manufacturing industries and many relief packages in the long run to private enterprises by the government\\nWe, as laymen, see many private enterprises going to bankruptcy as an aftermath of this COVID-19 crisis. The longer we put lockdown in place, the greater the number of private enterprises filing for bankruptcy. We cannot lock the country for an indefinite period. It has to ease. We do not see the point in general/ complete lockdown.\\xa0 Only if a country can afford, then can it be locked down for an indefinite period and or until vaccines are made available. After all, it has now become necessary to learn how to live safely amid pandemic.\\n(Rimal is the treasurer at the Media Foundation, Nepal and Dr Lohani is the Professor at Nobel College, Pokhara University.

       "  \"\\nManish Thapa\\n\\xa0Data is an invaluable part in negating the impact of COVID-19 on livelihood of families especially of those depending on daily wages, sales of agricultural products and families not having stable source of income in the government's effort to respond to COVID-19. The government needs to collaborate with all like-minded agencies, use whatsoever data they could compile, analyze, and interpret to find and support the communities. In current pandemic scenario, efficient data management can be the savior for many.\\nCOVID-19 and its impact \\nCOVID-19 erupted from the Chinese city of Wuhan back in December 2019 and travelled to almost all the countries impacting millions. COVID-19 spread across the world as there were no strict travel restrictions immediately after the infection was reported. Once COVID-19 was declared pandemic, majority of the countries including Nepal started searching for travel history of those entering the country either by air or land. Though, travel history of those coming from the airport could be traced that could not be done of the individuals entering by land. In such scenario, an efficient database management system becomes very important. After lockdown, all small to large business and industries are closed, daily wage workers are jobless, and farmers are unable to sell their agricultural products. These all factors directly or indirectly affected their income resulting in difficulty to make ends meet.\\nRealization about importance of data\\nOnce the pandemic was declared and country went into lockdown, the government should have looked for data mainly-\\n\\nTo identify the individuals who have travel history and map out the areas where they travelled upon returning to country\\nTo map out the areas with chances of spread of pandemic\\nTo identify and support the most affected or likely to be affected population\\nTo map out the available resources (human, financial, materials/equipment) with government as well as private institutions\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThe government should have immediately conveyed the message to each local bodies to track individuals with travel history and identify families with poor economic condition. It has already announced an economic relief package to support and the local bodies are still collecting data manually delaying the response related activities at the community level. Though, the country is in its third week of lockdown, the government is yet to completely track and test the individuals with travel history and identify and respond to the families in need. This has further worsened the issue among families with poor financial condition leading to dissatisfaction toward government body.\\nUse of data during disaster to respond affected families\\nIn recent years, there has been increasing use of data during any type of humanitarian response or planning by the government and I/NGOs. Whenever any disaster occurs, the government and I/NGOs rush for having data of most affected or likely be affected. After some time, all organizations concerned collect data and respond to the needy families. Accurate data can help local authorities to predict the areas where problem may erupt, support authorities to plan and prioritize their resources toward the geographical areas and communities with highest need and help to effectively coordinate with like minded agencies.\\nData collection practice in Nepal\\nMuch of the data required by the government authorities already exists but in scattered form. In annual manner, the government and NGOs invest millions of dollar just on data collection to identify the unemployed youth, houses without basic amenities such as toilet, drinking water, electricity, etc, access to health services and production and sales of agricultural products. No matter what the objectives are, the major target of all the data collection activities are to identify the families and their needs, plan and intervene through the programs to fulfill their needs. The government authorities officially record the data of every single citizen through national level statistics i.e. census in every 10 years. Back in 2070 BS, government authorities (the then poor household coordination board) conducted survey and ranked households based on their economic condition in more than 25 districts. Likewise, the local bodies repeatedly update their local government level profile for which they conduct census. Similarly, the government officially records information of Nepali citizen for citizenship registration, birth certification, marriage certification, passport, driving license, health insurance schemes, social protection schemes, etc. Likewise, there are number of I/NGOs that conduct surveys and take detailed information of families. Many of the times, each household is required to provide similar information to multiple institutions (government and non-government) more than once a year.\\nIssues faced in lack of appropriate data\\nThe federal government has developed the criteria for the individuals and families that are likely to be affected by COVID-19 pandemic. The local bodies localized the criteria and initiated data collection and response activities. As of now, mostly food items have been provided by the government authorities as well as non-government agencies. The whole process delayed response and seems to be haphazard rather than systematic. Were there any previous collaborative approach between all those data collecting agencies, the response activities could have been done in timely and systematic manner. Though, every institution claims to be data-rich, none of them seems to be working together. The need of repeating same process again and again not only delayed the response but also increased the chances of non-vulnerable having their name in the list of affected and vulnerable families. This has been heard and seen during the Gorkha Earthquake (2015) and floods every year. The same has been seen during COVID-19 pandemic as well with news about people raising their voice against selection of wrong families circulating around the print media and the internet. Though, there have been talks about integrated and centralized data collection system, the government is yet to fully functionalize and operationalize it leading to lack of authentic data. This particular issue has been resolved by issuing national identity cards by European countries, USA, Malaysia, Philippines and India to name a few.\\nFuture government plan \\nThe process of tracing and ranking the families based on their economic conditions from 26 districts has been re-started this fiscal year. More than Rs 600 million has been allocated for the second phase of household identification survey that concluded its first phase some five years back. Similarly, all local bodies have been ranked based on Human Development Index (HDI). These data could be used for effective planning, allocation, and mobilization of resources. Back in the second week of March 2020, the Office of Prime Minister and Council of Minister registered Statistics Bill-2020 at the National Assembly. This bill included the proposal of making data production, processing, storage, publication, and distribution more effective, efficient, reliable and systematic. This bill has dreamt of having National Data System to integrate records of data collected or compiled by the government offices for official purposes. Likewise, the Central Bureau of Statistics has already initiated census, which was done previously back in 2011. Once, the data will be collected, hopefully, the local bodies should not run door to door for collecting data every time any planning is to be done and response activities are to be started.\\n(The author is M.

But this is a globalized world and the cat is out of the bag. I am not an expert on this but what I understand is, this virus will come for us one day, whether we like it or not. As a nation, we can either be prepared for it, or we can be paralyzed with fear.\\nI am sitting in a country that might have got it all wrong by not controlling the virus on time. In the UK the numbers of tested cases was just three in the beginning of February. By now, thousands of people from Prime Minister Boris Johnson to, hundreds of heath workers have been infected. More than 1,000 people have already died. The numbers show no signs of slowing down and the health system is threatening to cave in. Like every country, the UK does not have enough ventilators or ICU, or hospital beds \\xa0– and health workers are lamenting the severe lack of personal protective equipment (PPE). By the end of this crisis, several thousand will lose their lives. As there is limited testing, there is no saying how many have really got it. According to a story from Oxford University, half of UK’s population might have already contracted COVID-19.\\nThe good news is, Nepal has already slowed down the spread of the virus with the lockdown. It means instead of spreading like wildfire – from one person to three people to nine, the rate will slow down dramatically. According to a Channel 4 interview of Hugh Montgomery, Professor of Intensive Care Medicine of University College London, as many as 59,000 people can be infected by a single person by the time the virus covers ten cycles. If you break the cycle, the infection rate slows significantly. \\xa0The lockdown in Nepal means that we have time to plan. It means that we can get our health system in a better place, a chance for the nation to come and work together.\\nNepal and the UK went into a lockdown on the same day. Here, the lockdown still means that shops are open for essentials like food and medicine. People are expected to shop for the basic necessities but just once a week. They are expected to step out and exercise once a day but maintain a two-meter distance. Delivery services are more active than ever. Essential services like water, electricity, garbage disposal are still working. Appreciation for UK’s National Health Service, the NHS has been heartwarming to see. Five star restaurants have been delivering food for NHS staff\\xa0 and stores have been open exclusively for them. \\xa0Half a million people have signed up to support them – from delivering goods to taking phone calls for them.\\nIn these times of crisis, the pecking order has changed. The crisis has shown the importance of the people who have been paid the worst – shop workers, garbage cleaners and delivery van operators. Police are imposing fines on people traveling for no reason. And the government has put together a plan to rescue the economy – an injection of money into the economy, including income support for people who can’t go to work.\\nI am not suggesting the exact same methods would work in Nepal. But there can be measures taken to ensure that basic essential services are provided to people - from food to garbage collection, from water to medicines. Essential services cannot be stopped – the mode of working can be modified.\\nMahabir Pun has shown us that there are ways to innovate – can companies like KTM city/ ANTA and other clothes manufacturer mass-produce PPEs? Can local tailors be employed in the process? Can engineering students look to produce masks or life-saving equipment? What kinds of 3D printing can we use? Unlike the time of the earthquake, Nepal has a local and provincial government which can mobilize locally and it is the perfect time for the leadership to show that electing them was worth it. Some have already shown the quality of their leadership. It also gives the federal government the time to show their mettle and rescue and repatriate the poorest and the neediest. Like the men in UAE, forced to sleep in parks. Like the hundreds of thousand of Nepalis who are taking the arduous journey of coming back home from India, after Modi’s lockdown. They may need to be quarantined but coming home is their right.\\nThis is also the time for the government to show that they can plan beyond themselves. It means reaching out to health professionals from Nepal ,and coordinate with the Chinese counterparts who have experiences dealing with COVID-19. Our health professionals will be the ones who are constantly exposed to the virus and will take on immense stress. I’ve been in contact with some friends who are doctors here and some in New York. They express sadness, and distress as more patients die. Health staff will need all the protection and support that we can give.\\nFor the media practitioners, it means that we need to get the right messages out \\xa0– to the furthest corners – messages that will allow people to plan and prepare, and protect the most vulnerable from the disease. \\xa0\\xa0\\nFor our leaders, this also means letting go of the hubris of the two-third majority government and calling out to people from all sectors who would be able to help out, coming up with an economic plan that will save people from losing their jobs and livelihood, \\xa0devising a rescue plan that will save everyday workers from death by hunger. This virus calls for kindness and compassion, along with strong foresight and planning from Nepal’s leadership. This responsibility falls on our ailing prime minster to social media influencers - what leaders say and show is now more important than ever. \\xa0\\nWhile I am writing this, I have been coughing. My chest feels leaden. I fluctuate between energy and exhaustion. These are mild symptoms of COVID-19. Luckily, my family went straight into a quarantine mode, controlling the spread of the virus with us. As of now, the mortality rate from the virus is calculated between 1% to 3.4%. But if we infect the small proportion who might get their complications, their chances of survival becomes slim, especially if they don’t get hospital support.\\nUnlike the time of the quake, we won’t have the world looking out for us. Our country has survived many disasters and this is just one of many. Fear of the virus will get us nowhere but foresight and planning will help us navigate this pandemic.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAs nations around the world prepare for coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, people involved in the informal sector of economy will be the hardest hit for managing their daily amenities, mostly in developing countries like Nepal. Social and financial protection fo the daily wage workers in the informal sector has always been a major issue in Nepal where more than 70 percent (ILO report, 2019) of the economically active population is involved. This issue has never been more critical than now when the country is in total lockdown, to curb the spread of this deadly virus. Another thing alarming is Nepal’s lack of preparedness toward scaling up it healthcare system, given the current handling capacity could be overwhelmed as the need for intensive care may surge in the near future.\\nThough the pandemic is shaking the whole globe right now, developed countries with comparatively small percentage of their workforce in the informal sector has to struggle less to cope with evolving unemployment issues. In the US, the government has passed a $2.2 trillion emergency relief package that, among others, would provide up to $1,200 in direct relief for American adults as compensation for temporary unemployment. In the United Kingdom, the government agreed to pay up to 80 percent of wages of workers not been able to work due to coronavirus crisis.\\nMeanwhile, the nationwide lockdown imposed by the Government of Nepal (GoN) is definitely a right move to minimize the spread of virus. The lockdown has, however, badly affected the low-income or daily wage workers in the informal sector as their livelihood options have come to a complete halt. These people are in desperate need of financial support in terms of relief packages to manage their basic necessities. Whilethe Indian government has already come with a set of policy measures to combat the economic impact of the fast-spreading coronavirus including some cash transfers to workers in the informal sector, ours is yet to declare any sort of such relief packages for the needy and poor.\\nOne thing that may be stopping the government from bringing relief packages for informal workers is unavailability of data, which may be preventing them from making informed policies. There is the need that lives of informal workers are protected as well as their jobs are secured. But, this does not seem possible at this time. \\xa0Learning from this tragic situation, when this pandemic goes way, the government should find ways to document the active workforce involved in the informal economy, keep measures of their inputs in the country’s overall economic activities and most importantly, develop social protection mechanism for them, especially considering the rough situations that may come again.\\nThis is also the time when health workers worldwide have urged countries to step up measures that can keep reported cases at a level manageable for health-care systems, a concept known as ‘flattening the curve.’\\nNepal has poor health-care services and lacks medical infrastructure, health personnel and equipment; is poorly prepared to handle a large-scale outbreak due to coronavirus. Hence, the need to scaling-up health facilities, in terms of medical equipment and health workers seems another key challenge for Nepal in this difficult time.\\nEven in major cities like Kathmandu where healthcare facilities seem in good numbers, subject to its dense population the danger of wider infection is just a few miles away, if no substantial efforts are made to upgrade its service. More worse is the situation in rural areas where people have far less access to scares health facilities. Nevertheless, the government has taken various precautions to prevent the spread of disease. Quarantine wards and temporary hospitals are being set up across the country and laboratory facilities are being expanded at provincial centers.\\nDespite these worthy steps by the government in expanding medical coverage to curb possible outbreak, much still remains to be done. First, there is the utmost need to upscale capacity of our laboratories for conducing more and more tests. More test of the samples will help map the actual level of spread of the infection. Second, hospitals need to multiply its present capacity for isolation wards with needed medical equipment as well as should increase the number of health workers. And, third, ensure availability of enough personal protective equipment (PPE) for our health workers as they are the first responders to the patients, and are themselves in high risk of infection.\\xa0\\nThis pandemic is a nightmare for all, but rather than panicking we should act responsibly. The government should come up with holistic approach to address multi-dimensional challenges arising while dealing with this pandemic. The most important thing is we should together care for those hardest hit, and reduce our blind spots to risks in this time of coronavirus.\\n(Shrestha is a PhD scholar in Theoretical Economic at Peking University and Joshi the Chairperson of SCOPE Nepal)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nHas anybody ever wondered how transportation of plants in a globalized world affect the environment? Perhaps not everyone has had a sense of it since the notion of globalization in this modern era is symbolized in terms of people and products transported across the globe. Movement of products, including plants and animals were common right since, or perhaps even before, our great explorers discovered regions and continents. That however was done without the knowledge on the range of outcomes it would have. Coming to this point of time, we can see how transportation of seeds and plants has impacted our environment. One of the most prominent example is the pervasive invasive plants that have had a huge impact on the ecology of forest, cropfields, pastures, wetlands and beyond. In fact, it has caused billions of dollars of economic loss globally. Among them is Mikania micrantha, popularly known as mile-a-minute, due mainly to its fast-growing and rapidly-spreading nature.\\nNative to South America, Mikania is believed to have spread across South and South-east Asia, and even in Australia and dozens of Pacific Islands. One would be mulling over how it travelled such a long distance to cause mayhem. Some believe that it was deliberately brought over to continents for plantation, primarily aimed at controlling landslides and as cover crop. The rapid growth and strong rooting makes the soil less prone to landslides. Others believe that natural causes brought them to various spots which later spread across wider geographical regions. Nepal has not been spared off this problem where it is believed that Mikania has spread to 30-plus districts across eastern and western regions of the country. It was first seen in the east and overspreading toward the western region and even toward the northern parts of the country. Its cover is higher in wetland-rich habitats in southern lowland mainly Jalthal Jhapa, Koshi Taapu Wildlife Reserve and Chitwan National Park. The spreading of Mikania in Chitwan National Park has in fact obstructed the movement of rhinos and other wildlife in addition to destroying their habitat.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOur forests in crisis\\nSo much can be heard about deforestation or forest fire ruining our forests in Nepal. But very little is known or talked about invasive species wrecking our forests. Jalthal, a swath of natural remnant forest spread over 6000 hectares area in Jhapa is a living example. Because of its size, bioldiversity and species assemblage, Jalthal is a critical biodiversity hotspot of Nepal. Not limited to that, Jalthal is place where trees and culture meet, where the forest has been crucial for maintaining cultural diversity in the region.\\xa0 Jalthal forest is a source of wide spectrum of ecosystem services people living around. Overshadowing this essential ecosystem, people have been striving to save their forest from Mikania. And it’s not static at all. The more they remove it, the more rapidly it reappears in a few months. As you walk through the lush green jungle of Jalthal, a Kathmanduite who is accustomed to crowd and concrete building, will have a feeling of serenity. For a rookie, even the invasive plants looks like a green bush, and appears to have co-existed with the trees for a while. But in reality, it is killing the forest, by not allowing the regeneration of new trees. In fact, the entire forest biodiversity is bolted by the invasive species and nothing seems to be penetrable through it.\\xa0\\xa0\\nFrustrated with little hope on reviving their forest, people of Jalthal are desperate to get rid of it. Fed up of volunteering, they have sought help from agencies including the Divisional Forest Office in Jhapa, but to no avail. A strong claim for adopting scientific forest management is what they get in response, as if a panacea for the problem has already been tested. ‘Forest officers are trying to promote teak plantation, which is believed to swipe out the invasive species from forest’, says one of the locals in Jalthal area. While ecologists believe that teak might be a choice in getting rid of invasive species, however on the darker side, it prohibits regeneration and growth of any desirable plants around it. It also creates green desert within the forest. A rather ‘quick-fix’ solution is in attempt while a much needed deliberation is set aside. For those who believe attaining prosperity from forestry is possible only through timber, this would definitely be convincing. But this would overshadow the very notion of biodiversity and value of natural forests.\\nThe Solution\\nPossibly the very first idea to get rid of cancer cells would be to do away with it from the human body. That perhaps could be the case of forests infested with Mikania. However, that merely won’t make a permanent solution. Its removal should come along with regeneration of native tree species, and for this, periodic removal is important to allow new growth. Now this does not happen without the involvement of communities. There are 22 community forest user groups operating in and around Jalthal area. Mobilization of the user groups would be of utmost importance. But, the question is would they invest their time and effort just to save forest. Perhaps most of them may, but for others voluntarism could be costly. While there have been attempts to tie up forest conservation with livelihood generation across Nepal, the idea of turning trash to cash might work here. Turning invasive species to compost will have a dual benefit, first Mikania will be removed from the forest, and second compost can be later utilized in farms and even sold in the market. This would likely get in some share of the 150,000 tons of fertilizers that Nepal imports.\\nMost importantly, management of Mikania should not be an add-on to forest conservation. It needs to be an integral part of forest management because we may not know to what extent it would break our forest, but what we already know is that it is catastrophic to our forests and biodiversity. The very notion of attaining prosperity from forests will only be possible if our forests sustain and remain healthy. Overlooking the issue of invasive species will undermine the potentiality of our forests. It is therefore time for the policies to reflect this.\\xa0\\xa0\\nA greater action and collaboration is very much needed at the local level. The government, primarily the Division Forest Office and other local agencies need to create an enabling, and collaborative, environment to engage local forest user groups. Creating an incentive mechanism would be an added value. It should not merely be about ticking off an activity out of the list, after all, we are here because our forests area here. So it's about saving our forests and all of us who live on it.\\xa0\\n(Karki and Sharma are researchers at ForestAction Nepal)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWhy China thrives\\r\\n\\r\\nChina is grabbing fervent attention these days thanks to its high economic growth rate, the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative and the trade war. Positive changes come when the government has one righteous goal - the prosperity of its people. America, in a matter of around 400 years of European settlement, became the most influential country in the world. Europe enjoyed full-fledged prosperity earlier that America and that prevails to this day. However, with the consistent high economic growth rate for almost four decades, China seems to be beating the competition now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article aspires to explore some of the key elements that are propelling the northern neighbors forward in the economy race.\\r\\n\\nGovernment system suited to the soil and stability\\n\\r\\nThere are debates among political scholars around the world about the system adopted by the communist country – is it socialist market economy, private capitalism or state capitalism? China claims it is a ‘socialist market economy’, the term coined by past president Jiang Zemin. Whatever the debates and claims, the thing to be understood is that China adopts a system suited to its soil, unique to the world and that prioritizes people’s economic rights over political ones.\\xa0Countries like China with recorded history going back to over 3500 years have outdated and feudalistic structures with wide social, political and economic gaps in the population coming to the 20th century. The structures need to be demolished to build new, stronger ones, and to narrow the gap. China understood the necessity and orchestrated the transformation ending the monarchy in 1912, and establishing the communist government in 1949. So, unlike the USA, which has a comparatively short history and where almost all people four centuries ago started from the same baseline, China had to have a stalwart government to hit the social structure and to vehemently transform the nation. A powerful government committed to bringing positive transformation whatever the cost propels China’s economic prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, the one-party political system in China, disparaged by the West, gives government stability, something very important to plunge the nation into strategies to realize long-term visions. The stability facilitates the government to plan decades’ long projects and to consistently perform to complete them.\\r\\n\\nNecessary Freedom\\n\\r\\nPolitical pundits around the world claim that the best systems of government have freedom embedded in them, and freedom is the most fundamental prerequisite to prosperity; however, such claims need to speak for the necessity of deeper understanding of freedom too.\\r\\n\\r\\nJean Jacques Rousseau in his famous essay ‘The Social Contract’ claimed that man is born free but everywhere he is in chains. Humans are in chains -- chains which could be dispensed like norms of conservative societies, illogical traditions, and customs, etc., which restrain human potential. In many democratic countries, people fall victim to such chains. China has unshackled people from such chains allowing channeling of all energy on only that is necessary, which is economic prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreedom as the most cherished value is indubitable but the question that flares up is -- is freedom the right to obstruct and to sabotage every development arrangement of the government or is it the availability of the ground to pursue and fulfill dreams? Humans are free when they can hope and can engage to fulfill their dreams, and Chinese people seem to have been availed of this necessary freedom. They can safely walk the streets in the middle of the night, can experiment with novel ideas in science and technology, and can start their own business with regulations that facilitate their endeavor. This is the type of freedom people necessarily want and which drives the economy of a nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nVarious world-class surveys have shown that Chinese women constitute a very high percentage of a total of self-made female billionaires comparing to other nations.\\xa0Women like Yang Mianmin of Haier, Sun Yafang of Huawei, Dong Mingzhu of Gree Appliances and Peng Lei of Ali Baba have been inspiring others by their achievements in the tech world. This happened due to the availability of necessary freedom. Economic prosperity does not come by engaging in the unnecessary in the name of political freedom. The thriving of economy demands for the cruelest of struggle, which in turn demands necessary control.\\xa0For over three decades, China has been marching forward with the highest economic growth and these recent years, it has been challenging others in 5G, artificial intelligence and robotics. According to the publication of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), China was the largest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) among developing economies in 2018 thanks to the attractive environment for the security of investment and the necessary freedom to thrive it provides. If the country had curbed necessary freedom, it would not have been a haven for foreign investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNature operates by rules of binary opposition -- there must be autonomy but there must be control from the benevolent force too. China constrains unnecessary political rights but offers the necessary freedom that lets people flourish economically.\\r\\n\\nInclusive institutions\\n\\r\\nIn the book ‘Why Nations Fail’, authors Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that the nations having ‘inclusive’ institutions succeed whereas those with ‘extractive’ institutions fail. They elaborate on inclusive institutions as those which provide an incentive for talent and creative ideas and extractive institutions as those which allow the elite to rule over, exploit and extract wealth from the weak.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn spite of democracy, many countries are struggling because the system is vulnerable to misuse by political leaders who encourage extractive institutions and serve a few elites. Many times in democratic countries, it is seen that big companies cater only to their profits and puppeteer the government forcing it to ignore the welfare of the larger mass of people.\\xa0In China, the government that intends to rocket the country’s economy empowers inclusive institutions by funding startups and new ventures and also encouraging angel investors and venture capitalists to invest in them.\\r\\n\\nRejecting fatalism and pushing technology\\n\\r\\nChinese culture and system discourage people to see religious reasons behind their adversities and encourage rational approach. More the populace of the country is indoctrinated with outdated scriptures and religious teachings; the less likely they are to thrive. Being a country whose beliefs are not guided by religion, the country certainly has an advantage over others as religions tend to make people fatalistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina has emphasized the development of science and technology. There is massive spending on research and development, students are encouraged to go abroad for studies, and Chinese universities are tied up with the best of foreign universities. People are pushed into being technology savvy. The government has ambitious plans in 5G, AI and robotics. The country has already exhibited its world-class excellence in many infrastructure projects. China’s devotion to flourish science and technology helps it thrive economically.\\r\\n\\nMinding own business\\n\\r\\nOne of the principal reasons behind China’s consistent economic growth also has been its non-interference principle. The country has meddled comparatively lesser into the matters of others. China believes in feeling the stone in water and walking alone silently. While powerful and rich nations are squandering their resources to wage war and topple down governments, China is marching head-on with blinders that allow seeing just the finishing line.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, when other nations are diverging away from their real issues, China has been able to maintain its focus on the rights of its people to economically prosper and is beating others in the economy race.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Mahesh Koirala is an independent thinker with a Master’s degree in political science)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

The overall 40 % or so passed in the past has been due to the strength of results of private schools that have over 90 % passing, whereas in public schools the pass rate hovers around 30 %. The statistics point to a massive tragedy, where neither the government nor civil society seems to be able to reverse this terrible trend.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo amount of tinkering by the authorities to make a better SEE result seems to have mattered – they reduced the course content for Grade X, then they required only Grade X content to be tested in the SEE, they decided students need not pass all subjects in order to complete SEE, and they decided to ask the schools to send practical marks for several subjects. But none of this has helped stem the tide of poorly qualified students exiting school level.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents all over the country continue to go to school with high hopes, but they have been let down by the state and society alike. Their future is shattered when we have results such as the latest one, which also simultaneously destroys the country’s future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\nDepth of disparity\\r\\n\\r\\nThis article is an attempt to analyze in depth the SEE results, an attempt to go beyond the immediate recriminations in the media after which we go back to our daily lives, assuming fatalistically that nothing can be done to improve public school education.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlways, we get numbers and understand that private schools are doing better, but we fail to understand the depth of the disparity, and the serious implications flowing from this. Should we be alarmed by the status quo? What do the SEE results as publicized by the media do to the morale and psyche of students in public schools? What is going on in the homes around the country where there is now such eagerness for education, among the well-to-do and the poor alike? Parents are sending their children to schools, and indeed Nepal has achieved over 97% access with gender parity, but are the parents going to continue to trust public schools after this continuing debacle?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it fair that poor parents all over the country are forced by peer pressure as well as demands of the children to spend their scarce resources on private schools? Simultaneously, what about the massive volume of resources being spent on public schools, squandered in buildings, libraries and labs that rarely get used, and teachers who draw good salary but tend to shirk from the required work. What is the best use of our scarce resources, or shall we simply continue to squander?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have heard much about the impact of social environment and nurture on child development. The lack of early childhood care in our sociologically transforming society and the absence of adequate nutrition might have something to do with the discrepant results in the public schools. However, the lack of stimulation and proper teaching once the children enter public schools in particular definitely handicaps the children more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been numerous efforts to improve public schooling over the years, now that the challenge of access has been largely overcome, however quality stubbornly refuses to improve, as seen in the latest SEE results. Overall, the answer seems to lie in certain decisions to be internalized and adopted by political leadership\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalyzing the SEE results\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing back to the SEE results for 2019, the total number of students sitting for SEE examinations from private schools has continued to grow, at over 29 %, which is almost a third of the total population of students sitting for the examinations. We can see that nearly one-third of the student population is attending private institutions. This itself is indication of the failure of successive governments in terms of improving the quality of public schools – there is no doubt that parents all over the country will opt for public schools if the education were of quality.\\r\\n\\r\\nIncongruously, but correctly, we must pronounce as alarming for the nation – the fact that there has not only been a steady increase in the number of private schools in the country, but also a commensurate increase in the proportion of private school students doing extremely well in SEE.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe best results are in the category of A+ (GPA 3.6-4) in the exams. Of the 325,330 public school students who sat for SEE, 2792 received A+, which comes to 0.86%. Of the 133,945 private school students who sat for the exams, 14,788 received A+, which comes to 11.04 %. Thus students who study in private schools are 12.8 times more likely to get an A+ in SEE than those attending public schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second best category of results are A (GPA 3.2-3.6). Students who study in public schools have a 3.4 % chance of scoring A, whereas those studying in private schools have a 29.8 % percent chance of the same. Students attending private schools are 8.6 times more likely to get A grade than those studying in public schools.\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents in private schools have a 33.25% chance of scoring A or above, or one third of the students in private schools score A and above, whereas 4 % of those studying in public schools score A and above.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile there is a similar proportion of students scoring B in both type of schools, the chances of scoring a B+ is 3.5 times higher in private schools than in public schools. Looking at the lower end of the grades, there is a 69.02% chance that a student in a government school will get C+ or less, whereas for a student going to private schools the chance that they will score such a grade is only 12.87%.\\r\\n\\r\\nCertainly, students should not be judged on the three hour exams they sit for, but this standardized summative test is what the government has chosen to be the benchmark for assessing children when they complete Grade X. We, therefore, have no choice but to regard this as the final assessment as school graduates prepare for college.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also feared that as the SEE exams become more skill-based, the chances are that the public school students will fare worse, because the public school system takes a very long time to respond, thus continuing a downward spiral for public schools and all who study there. It is, therefore, vitally important that policy makers understand this and force the bureaucracy that runs the public schools to start assessing students on multiplicity of skills, rather than the narrow memorization and writing of exams in which they have done quite poorly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been many attempts to change the status of SEE, but all attempts have been shortcuts marked by a reluctance to put in the hard work. The students are always the ones who suffer as the school system administrators play with their lives.\\xa0 When there was a suggestion that the SEE not enforce students to pass all the subjects, it was expected that each student would develop skills and understanding in at least a few subjects. However, nothing has changed. Students now learn the same or less than before because now they do not have to be accountable for passing all the subjects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe letter grading system was introduced in order to change the teaching-learning in the classroom so that the children worked under the Benjamin Bloom's taxonomy, which differentiates between basic and higher order thinking. However, neither the teaching method nor the nature of examinations changed, and with the marks based on first order questioning of retelling and recalling which was converted to grades. The difference between those who get a D and an A is not on the quality of their thinking and their analytical skills, but on the number of questions they have managed to answer correctly.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, given that fact that that students did not have to pass in all the subjects meant that teachers and students both stopped working harder. If they were not going to fail, why should they work harder? We must understand how countries develop: it is by developing a work ethic among the young, at school. The SEE examinations as they have evolved, if anything, take away the necessity of due diligence from teachers, from students and from the education administrators. The end result is the tragic situation of today, where the education system itself is dragging down the prospects of the population and the national future.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the sake of the future\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear that there is something systematically wrong in the way public schools are being run in our country and we all need a wake-up call if we are not going to be stuck in social morass and endless economic distress. We do not have to go with world trends, we need to have a unique system that works for Nepal. The future of our youngsters cannot be compromised for short-term goals without thinking of the long-term development of the country, and the lives of each of these children.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe need to appeal to the administrators of the school system to be committed to the children of Nepal, who represent the future of Nepal. We need to appeal to the representatives who have been elected to the local governments under the mandate of the new Constitution, to build a demand so great for quality in public schools that no political leader at the center, the provinces, or the municipalities, can hope to ignore them. We owe it to the children to start the focus on early childhood and move through the grades providing the best quality of education Nepal can afford.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The author is Director of Rato Bangala School)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n                            Few words of condolences, insufficient and haphazardly distributed relief, and a\\xa0lot of unfulfilled promises of compensation and recovery: this has always been the norm for disaster response in our country. Talks of missed opportunities and possible avenues for the future among the government and the experts flood the media immediately after a disaster only for them to be forgotten in a not so distant future.\\xa0 The families of the victims, however, have to live with the pain of losing their loved ones forever.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we look at our approach toward disaster management, it would not be wrong to say that we have always reacted and responded to disasters as if there was nothing we could do and\\xa0we were just supposed to submit to it. None of the\\xa0major\\xa0disasters has impelled our political and techno-administrative fraternity to urgently develop a robust mechanism for long-term disaster management. Be it the 2008 Koshi Floods, the 2015 Gorkha Earthquake, the recurrent floods in Tarai or the most recent tragedy caused by the unprecedented windstorm in Bara-Parsa, the “lessons learnt” have translated to non-existent preparations for similar future events. And it does not look like changing any time soon which has only served to fuel the increasing doubt in the minds of the public toward the\\xa0direction\\xa0of the current hierarchy on various critical issues--disaster management being one of them.\\xa0 With its action incommensurate with the rhetoric of prosperity and happiness being put forward, it is important to realize that the mismanagement of resources is what is hurting us more than the lack of resources itself.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe say “disasters are acts of nature, damages result from the acts of man.”Disasters are not in our control but our preparations and response to them can greatly dictate the extent of the damages we suffer. Preliminary field studies have highlighted the inefficacy of our existing relief distribution system as can be seen from the state of the afflicted who still struggle to get their hands on basic relief materials even a week after the tragedy in Bara-Parsa. The reports have also indicated the existing influence of the so-called upper-class on the entrusted officials. Despite a lot of concerns being raised over the existing one-door policy/mechanism, the situation has not changed.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne would assume from the number of visits of the affected area by the high-profile leaders of the country, including the prime minister, ministers from the center and the province along with the opposition leaders, that the situation there would not be as dire. But the reality suggests that these visits might have been nothing more than a popularity contest as the pitiable situation, especially of the children, the old and the pregnant women fail to improve. Proper coordination among the governments at the central, provincial and local levels in post-disaster management situation clearly seems to be lacking.\\r\\n\\r\\nLack of government priority\\r\\n\\r\\nAs per the disaster database of the country, more than 12,000 people have fallen victims to disasters in the past decade.\\xa0 And if we exclude the 2015 earthquake, climate-related disasters account for nearly 80% of these fatalities, as per the Ministry of Home Affairs data. Furthermore, on top of the disruption of necessary services, economic loss of about as much as Rs 7 trillion have been incurred in the last 45 years\\xa0 (Himalkhabar, 2075-12-8).\\xa0 While the government has shown promise by prioritizing several infrastructural projects related to hydropower, irrigation and transportation among others and\\xa0championing them as projects of national pride, it has entirely overlooked the means necessary for safeguarding the lives of people. This is a complete antithesis to what the government is trying to achieve through sustainable development as shown by its neglect toward improving the weather forecasting mechanism of the country - it is high time we had a radar-based forecasting system.\\xa0 We are already more than late in coming to terms with the scientific evidence of the ever-increasing threat of climate-related extreme events. And by not preparing consolidated plans to tackle this threat, we are continuously exposing ourselves to unnecessary risk.\\xa0It is not that our officials and experts are unaware of these facts but accountability and responsiveness are what is lacking upon them. After all, it is the poor people who have to suffer, not them.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstitutional aspect\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Disaster Risk Reduction Management (DRRM) Act was promulgated in 2074, replacing the three-decade-old Natural Calamities Relief Act with the objective of shifting from the response-centered disaster management approach toward a more comprehensive disaster risk reduction which focuses on various dimensions of disaster management aligned with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The DRRM Act has envisioned to set up a dedicated body, National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority as well as define the roles of provincial and local governments. However, nearly two years after its enactment, the formation of the authority is still in limbo. Failure to timely implement the policies can lead to further tragedies. For example, recent studies suggest that the 1943 West Bengal famine in India which caused an estimated death of about 3 million resulted not from a drought disaster as is widely thought but from the British government’s policy failures (PTI, 2019-03-20).\\r\\n\\r\\nManagement of disasters constitutes a cycle of processes. Our plans and actions should be along these processes. Prevention, mitigation, response and recovery: all of these aspects need to be equally taken care of. Currently, our focus is much on the mitigation aspect which constitutes the structural measures against disasters. For example, constructing embankments is prioritized over flood forecasting and early warning systems. Preventive measures which include non-structural measures like reliable early warning system, improved forecasting, evacuation mechanism and temporary shelters, etc. should complement the structural measures for effective disaster management.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there are separate departments assigned with these sectoral mandates, it seems they were unable to figure out in time exactly who was commissioned with the task of response and relief after the Bara-Parsa disaster. This shows that the inclusion of local communities and authorities in the process of disaster management with awareness and capacity building can be a vital step toward reducing the disaster risk because after all, it is the locals who are affected the most. Furthermore, incorporating the local or community-based engineering into the mainstream disaster risk management framework is also a necessary step for improving resilience against disasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnical Challenges\\r\\n\\r\\nData is a vital source of information crucial for future planning and decision-making processes. There is no arguing that our data management system is meager at best. Unless strong and reliable database is available, disaster management is extremely difficult. All three levels of the government thus should be connected within an integrated database system which includes data related to demography, socio-economy and agriculture among others. With reliable data, the damage can be characterized better which will give a clear idea of how the response and recovery processes should be planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportance of research activities cannot be undermined in the current scenario. For an emerging nation like us, applied research having a direct impact on the society should be promoted, especially in the universities and academic institutions. However, it is of utmost importance that this research culture be transferred to the governmental organizations as well, as they are the implementing agencies.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major issues we have is the government’s inability to retain skilled technical youths in the country. Young professionals who gain advanced skills and technical knowledge through abroad study/ training in most cases settle there for the obvious prospect of a better future. Consequently, institutional capacity weakens. And whatever number of youths remain, their ideas are seldom heard. In a recent interview, an official from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology mentioned that even if the radar-based forecasting system were to be installed immediately, there were not enough skilled human resources to operate it. Therefore, it is high time the policy makers revisited their perspective on managing the technical human resources of the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the technical personnel are meant to solve real-world problems. But our governmental procedures are such that technical personnel are required to spend more time in overcoming administrative works rather than focusing on the main issues. When the technical personnel are entangled in such administrative procedures, their efficiency is bound to suffer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinal words\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the power holders and the decision makers still refuse to learn from the situation in Bara-Parsa and fail to take decisive action, the idea of ‘prosperous Nepal and Happy Nepalis’ is sure to be limited as mere rhetoric. Having said that, it couldn’t be a better time for the high-level government officials to act pro-actively and come up with short, mid and long-term visions in their respective sectors and convince decision makers to revisit plans and policies that are impeding the progress. Let us all act sincerely and sensitively to build back better.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, with the regular monsoon only a couple of months away and observing the unpredictable global climate pattern this year, we can’t afford any delay in preparing against the floods. Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, heavy rainfall induced flooding in west Japan and Iran, early flooding in Midwest USA, etc. are a few recent cases which we can take lessons from. The best time to prepare for a deluge is when it is still dry goes a saying. Let us all also put our sincerest efforts in minimizing the damage this monsoon.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The authors are students of Civil and Earth Resources Engineering at Kyoto University, Japan.)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            When the Maoist rebellion was attacking all aspects of state and society in the decadal conflict that started in 1996, community forestry (CF) was one of the few things that were not touched upon by this violent movement. Indeed, the Maoists embraced and supported CF as the very model of collective action and benefit-sharing which they wanted to create everywhere in the country through the ‘revolution’. Various independent studies supported that Nepal’s CF remained resilient in times of conflict.\\r\\n\\r\\nFormally started over four decades ago in the aftermath of Himalayan degradation crisis, Nepal’s CF system has truly come of age. With over 20,000 community forestry user groups (CFUGs) across the country, and with over 2 million families participating directly, this system has become the country’s largest platform of civic engagement as well as a solid foundation of local democracy. This movement is also positively correlated with the increase in forest cover to 44%, as some remote sensing studies show. This system is now under stake when the government is trying to introduce a new forest law as part of the wider legislative reform required by the new constitution. An important question that now arises is - how this time-tested and flagship development success of Nepal is being impacted by a proposed change in the forestry legislation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nNew Forest Bill\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the historic Constitution in 2015, Nepal’s parliament is updating over 300 legislations of the country to align the legislative system with the new Constitution. Forest Act 1993, which is seen as one of the most progressive in the world in terms of offering rights to local communities, is also one of such legislations that are being replaced with a new one, and the Ministry of Forest and Environment (MOFE) has already drafted a bill which is entering the parliament soon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not just the new Constitution that warrants changes in the forestry legislation in Nepal; the profoundly changing social and economic contexts reshaping forest and society relations also warrant legislative improvement in community forestry. And as a matter of rule, periodic changes in the forest legislation are necessary to enable positive forest society interface within the system of community forestry in Nepal. As the government looks to finalize the forest bill, there are at least five important aspects which need to be seriously considered to make any legislative changes prudent.\\r\\n\\r\\nResource ownership\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal’s public forests are regarded as ‘national forests’ as per the current law. Community forest is a part of national forest formally handed over to CFUG registered with the District Forest Office. The current Forest Act 1993 allows communities to enjoy perpetual rights over community forests once handed over to them. The government can suspend a CFUG in case of blatant mismanagement of community forest, but there is a compulsory legal provision to re-transfer the right to CFUG by reorganizing the group. Such a perpetual and sustained right of access to forest has been the key foundation for the success of community forestry in Nepal, and deviation from this foundational legal arrangement can jeopardize the achievements made to date.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho regulates CFGUs?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith federal Constitution and the election of three layers of the government - federal, provincial, and local - the question of who will regulate the community forestry system should be explored in the new light. The pre-federal arrangement is that District Forest Office, a district level unit of the national government Department of Forest, is authorized to legally register the CFUG as an institution to manage CF. This office is also legally empowered to transfer a part of national forest to a CFUG as per a forest operational plan, which forms a part of the contract between the CFUG and the government regarding the management and utilization of community forests. No local or subnational government arrangements are part of CF governance. Now in the new federal system, there is a strong and enlarged system of local government, with much greater powers to govern, as defined in the Constitution itself. Forest is also in the concurrent list of the Constitution, with community forestry related matters being the responsibility of local and provincial governments. Given this situation, it is prudent to offer local governments the power to register CFUGs and regulate their institutional aspects. The new Divisional Forest Office, under the provincial government, could be authorized to approve forest operational plans of CFUGs and then to transfer the forest rights to CFUGs. Any matters related to large wild animals, which are not common in community forestry but in national parks and conservation areas, remain the responsibility of the federal government.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenue sharing\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, Local Government Operations Act has been promulgated by the parliament and this has also touched on the subject of revenue sharing in community forestry system. It has required CFUG to pay 10% tax to local government on the sale of forest products by CFUGs to markets. Instead of revenue sharing arrangement, it would be better to have taxation arrangements based on financial transactions and profits. In time to come, CFUGs are likely to take more commercial path, and taxation policy for CFUGs can also be made similar to other businesses. As a matter of principle, taxes from community forestry should be shared among governments proportionately to the regulatory burden, in addition to the base tax levied by the federal government. An expert team can calculate figures through an assessment of constitutionally prescribed roles of the three layers of government, which can then be discussed with representatives of key stakeholders. A proposal for CFUG to pay taxes to local and provincial government may sound upraising to CFUGs, but it is important to reposition community groups in the new federal, democratic system of governance, in a marked shift away from the old Panchayat system when community forestry was devolved beyond local Panchayat governments.\\r\\n\\r\\nService delivery\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the critical aspects of community forestry development in Nepal has been how technical and institutional development services are managed. Nepal’s forest governance history as well as the Forest Act 1993 has authorized the Department of Forest as not only the regulator of community forestry, but also the provider of technical services - such as those related to forest assessment, planning, and management. While this practice has allowed communities to seek technical service from the government when there is limited alternative service outside, this arrangement has problematically mixed up regulatory/monitoring role and service delivery role, creating conditions for rent-seeking and the lack of responsiveness in the delivery of service itself. Based on this lesson, and also recognizing the principle of separation of technical service delivery and regulatory roles, CFUGs’ institutional autonomy should be respected and strengthened when it comes to identifying and choosing technical and institutional development service from the wider service industry. Indeed, there is a need to provide a clear and enabling regulatory arrangement for the registration and operation of service providers outside of the government system, while new Divisional Forest Office retains the power to monitor the quality and regulate the technical service. Technical and regulatory roles thus must be de-coupled.\\r\\n\\r\\nMonitoring and regulatory compliance\\r\\n\\r\\nCFUGs have developed excellent institutional capacity for self-governance, and have functioned well even without active monitoring from the government. Internal democratic practice and accountability procedures have evolved to underpin the institutional capacity of CFUGs. Yet, community system of governance cannot remain isolated from the larger system of governance, in which democratic oversight and regulatory compliance are essential aspects of forest governance. Until now, the Department of Forest, through its DFO, has retained the legal responsibility to monitor the performance of CFUGs. CFUGs are required to submit annual report covering institutional and forest-related activities of the fiscal year. In the new federal system, it is prudent to have multi-level monitoring and compliance mechanisms, assigning complimentary and clear roles to different levels of governments. Local governments should be authorized to monitor CFUG institutional practices - such as periodic general assembly, social inclusion, fairness in benefit distribution and so on. Reporting of these aspects should be done in an annual basis. The provincial government should monitor forest management related practices of the CFUGs, through less burdensome and less frequent reporting, perhaps three-yearly reporting of forest management and condition.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nThe moment to enact a new forest legislation in the newly federalized Nepal represents a new and important milestone in the six decades of community forestry evolution in the country. The new forest bill is an exciting opportunity to update and institutionalize community forestry, which was invented in the era of autocratic Panchayat system and was given a significant update after the advent of multiparty political system in 1990. With four decades of history, community forestry has produced diverse groups of actors - from advocates to critics, so it is important to see CF in a fresh light. Community forestry should neither be romanticized as a domain of community sovereignty, nor as something to be overly regulated by the state. The new forest bill must retain and consolidate the important institutional autonomy that community forestry has gained through years. It is also important to craft democratic connections between CFUG practice and the new federal system of governance. An institutional autonomous community forestry democratically connected to federal system of governance can offer a solid foundation for environmental sustainability and community prosperity in Nepal.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\n                            As a country intending to benefit from the China-led Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and its development potentials, Nepal needs to consider the criticisms regarding China’s practice of “debt-trap diplomacy.” Nepal also needs to work out the necessary strategies to avoid or escape a debt trap, if it indeed is a substantial threat. Under “debt-trap diplomacy,” borrower countries are unable to pay back to creditors the hefty loans with interest, and creditors are in a position to exert influence over national matters. If this is the case, the next issue is how the law and legal mechanisms may assist Nepal when adopting debt financing for heavy infrastructures.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirstly, the nature of the debt problem must be understood properly. It is more of a financial issue rather than a legal one. In the BRI strategies, China is, and will continue to grow as, a planner in addition to a leading investor in infrastructure projects that promote greater connectivity and trade. Many BRI countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are not only resource-rich or strategically-located, but oftentimes, struggling with weak social, political, and economic institutions. However, these are also the countries that desperately need an economic boost through mobilization of internal and external investment opportunities. They lack the infrastructures to facilitate trade, generate energy, promote the movement of goods and people, and stimulate societal growth, among other things. Needless to say, Nepal falls under this category.\\r\\n\\r\\nForeign debt has remained a major issue in international development. Due to the myriad of economic, social, and political obstacles facing such countries, debt trap becomes a major issue when large-scale investments are financed by foreign investors. For a country like Nepal, which has a history of dependence on foreign direct investment and aid, high corruption rates, and slow development, it is important to evaluate the risks of participating in projects under the BRI, as noted above, because the inability to pay back loans can result in a crippling economy, a loss of political power, and, in the worst case, a loss of sovereignty.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat does the debt trap look like?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Center for Global Development’s policy paper entitled “Examining the Debt Implications of the Belt and Road Initiative from a Policy Perspective” (CGD paper) examines the likelihood of problems related to debt sustainability (i.e. rising debt-to-GDP ratios) in 68 borrower countries; it found that eight were particularly vulnerable to debt distress (this did not include Nepal). Among these eight is neighboring Pakistan that has allegedly been charged a 5 percent interest rate on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects that amount to approximately $63 billion, of which $33 billion is invested in infrastructure projects.\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, lawmakers in Myanmar are increasing pressure on the government to pay back its $4 billion debt (with a 4.5 interest rate) to China. Most of the debt is said to have accumulated from 1998 to 2011, when Myanmar was struggling with West-imposed sanctions and only China was willing to lend capital. The debt has caused the government to scale back parts of the Myanmar-China Economic Corridor as well as reexamine the terms of a $10 billion, China-funded port project.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong the critics of the BRI, Sri Lanka has become an example of how developing countries fall into China’s “debt trap.” In late December 2017, Sri Lanka handed over its Hambantota port and 15,000 hectares of the surrounding land to China on a 99-year lease to pay off $1.1 billion in debt. According to a New York Times investigation, large sums of money “flowed directly to campaign aides and activities for Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa [(the previous president)], who had agreed to Chinese terms at every turn and was seen as an important ally in China’s efforts to tilt influence away from India in South Asia.” Additionally, Sri Lanka continued to accumulate debt to China with interest rates higher than those offered in the international market. Many questioned why the funding was approved when preliminary reports indicated that it was not a profitable project.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian scholars argue that the debt trap is caused primarily because of China’s high interest rates, and that countries, like Sri Lanka that handed over the China-funded Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport (MRIA) to India to operate, could benefit from low-interest loans of 1 percent from India. Additionally, Indian critics, like Brahma Chellaney, are especially fearful that China’s “imperial giant’s velvet glove cloaks an iron fist – one with the strength to squeeze the vitality out of smaller countries.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHow does China handle debt trap?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese issues beg the question of how China has and will approach projects that face issues of debt repayment. The CGD paper explains that China has largely dealt with the issues in a case-by-case manner. This has included writing off debt in exchange for disputed territories, forgiving or restructuring debt, and debt-for-equity swaps. However, if China officiates a single, integrated approach, smaller countries will gain more confidence regarding avoiding the issues of a debt trap.\\r\\n\\r\\nChina is also encouraged to join, rather than just observe, as it is doing currently, the Paris Club. The Paris Club is a “non-institution” institution comprising of 22 permanent members that are largely western, creditor nations. The objective of the Paris Club is to “find workable solutions to payment problems faced by debtor nations” that demonstrate a need for debt relief and a willingness to implement the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) suggested economic reforms. The Asian Development Bank, where China has the third highest voting power, is also an attending member. At the least, China is advised to coordinate its efforts of handling debt with the Paris Club and show transparency in its lending. China's presence certainly shows that China takes the allegations seriously.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can Nepal approach the problems of debt traps?\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite these “debt traps,” countries, including Nepal, will continue to approve China’s investment. Sri Lanka and China are expected to sign a free-trade agreement this year to encourage Sri Lankan exports to China. The Sri Lankan ambassador to China has emphasized that the BRI is a great opportunity to make Colombo Port city a financial center in South Asia. Moreover, China and Singapore are in negotiations with Sri Lanka to invest $1.1 billion in cement and steel plants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are various measures that Nepal can implement to prevent debt trap from becoming a reality. For domestic debt, in The Debt Trap in Nigeria: Towards a Sustainable Debt Strategy (2002), authors Okonjo-Iweala et al. argue that the inability of a weak legal and institutional framework, especially at the local levels, to handle public resources can lead to the mismanagement of economies and the problems related to debt overhang (p. 11). Legal reforms should focus on encouraging “effective and efficient utilization of present and future public resources [and] would ensure probity in public resource use, due diligence, transparency, and accountability …” (p. 16). The logic applies in the case of international investment as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, the existence and safeguarding of legal protections are also necessary in ensuring that assuming foreign debt is seriously considered by both the government and the public; for example, the Constitution of the Philippines allows the President to contract foreign debt only at the approval of the Monetary Board, and local laws ensure public participation via governmental representatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe CGD paper suggests that China needs to engage in multilateral lending practices of debt sustainability (e.g., transparency and concessionality) that is largely lacking in its bilateral lending practices. It furthers two recommendations to China:\\xa0 “1) to finance technical legal support to developing country borrowers, through new and existing multilateral mechanisms; and 2) to offer debt swap arrangements in support of environmental objectives” (p. 24). Additionally, Nepal itself needs to ensure the right funding plans, whether that’s grants or soft loans, are in place for large infrastructural projects like the trans-Himalayan railway or the Budhigandaki Hydropower Project.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorrower countries will accumulate significant debt if the projects do not produce anticipated profits. Therefore, it’s important to study and evaluate which infrastructures are essential to the country’s development and will stimulate the economy via, for example, trade, employment, and further investments. For example, in the Philippines, the “combination of domestic economic demand, diversity in aid funding, and a contentious political culture and civil society make a Chinese-dominated debt trap unlikely.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the current administration in the Philippines is ensuring that China has no sway in deciding which projects the Philippines ought to pursue; additionally, only after gaining project approval from the National Economic and Development Authority Board can the government of the Philippines take its proposal to the Chinese government. Typically, the government of the Philippines asks for at least three bidders nominated by the Chinese government, so that it is also involved in the process of picking the bidders and can be held accountable.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor countries that find themselves entrapped in debt, debt restructuring (i.e., reconsidering the terms and due dates of debt toward the advantage of the debtor) is a common tool used for resolution. In 2018, China engaged in talks about debt restructuring with Zambia after warning from the IMF about an impending debt distress. (27 percent of Zambia’s external debt is owed to China.) Scholars recommended that Zambia should increase transparency of its debt and perform a review of and strengthen its existing debt-management system. Moreover, others argue that, unlike the Western approach of measuring a project’s “success” in five years, the return on investment on China-funded infrastructure projects should be considered in a longer term of one to two decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can we take away for Nepal?\\nSome experts opine that the debt traps caused by China’s investments counter China’s own interests and are not motivated to gain influence; in many cases, China is the only available lender of construction services or capital (as was the case with Myanmar). Debt traps would also pressure China’s foreign-reserve exchanges, as investments in infrastructure projects are funded by said exchanges. With BRI projects' cheap financing and Chinese companies’ willingness to take on unprofitable projects, China would lose more if debt traps are widespread.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, some argue that corruption and political interests, not Chinese investments, are major factors in projects turning over a loss and entrapping governments in unsustainable debt. Even still, the BRI has been accused of enabling and sustaining corrupt authoritarians who accept bribes or embezzle funds so that the country eventually goes into severe debt. Demanding transparency about the funding agencies and discouraging anonymity of investors will be important solutions in this regard.\\r\\n\\r\\nCriticisms about debt trap vis-a-vis China-funded projects often originate from Western media and, in the case of Nepal and other smaller South Asian countries, India. Recently, US Vice President Mike Pence criticized China for drowning borrower countries in debt from loans they cannot afford. In response, China has emphasized that BRI projects have helped with development and improved livelihoods. (Currently, the US is promoting the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC), a counterpart of the BRI, to promote free trade in the region.)\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a positive note, China has defended the BRI and demonstrated its support for multilateralism and global governance standards. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that the infrastructure needs of the developing parts of the Asia Pacific will require $26 trillion by 2030, and China has only pledged $1 trillion; this clearly indicates that the BRI is an opportunity for multilateral and private investors from the West, and not a Chinese hegemony. Therefore, Western critics and nations also have an equal opportunity to invest and demonstrate what they preach.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, critics accuse the West of misrepresenting cases that supposedly exemplify China’s practices of “debt-trap diplomacy.” While the New York Times suggestively claimed that China forced Sri Lanka to “cough up a port” to pay back a part of its loans, local coverage of the exchange shows that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who suggested the exchange during talks of debt restructuring, and it was largely perceived as a positive development. Similarly, others point out the requirements of IMF’s loan conditionality has hurt Pakistan’s economy and required multiple bailouts by IMF itself, further indebting Pakistan.\\r\\n\\r\\nLawrence Freeman, a political-economic analyst, stresses that the accusations of debt trap are Western “propaganda and gossip” against China; he points to the British Jubilee Debt Campaign’s 2018 brief entitled “Africa’s growing debt crisis: Who is the debt owed to?” which shows that the maximum debt owed to China by African countries is estimated at $100 billion or 24 percent of the total debt. The rest is owed to a combination of other creditor groups: members of the Paris Club, the World Bank, the IMF, other multilateral institutions, and the private sector (excluding that of China).\\r\\n\\r\\nDebt trap is definitely an important consideration for Nepal as it joins the BRI. As of early 2018, foreign debt comprised of 16.9 percent of the total GDP and was owed largely to multilateral institutions like the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank followed by Japan, China, and India. The CGD paper does not consider Nepal to be at risk of debt distress, and Nepal has actively engaged in talks with China about bilateral lending for infrastructure projects. As far as China is concerned, it has always been considerate in its engagements with Nepal. This relationship is a major strength in dealing with a debt-trap scenario.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery investment assumes a reasonable level of risk. Most importantly, Nepal needs to carefully evaluate the process of selecting projects, of creating an investment portfolio (including considering the debt-to-equity ratio), and complying with the established laws and policies. The decision-making process must be based on the rule of law and the transparency of transactions. A competitive bidding process must not be compromised either. Additionally, the Nepali public should demand the opportunity to bring forth its concerns and actively engage in the process of finalizing important deals. Successful outcomes will depend on how well Nepal is able to negotiate the process of securing loans, resolve arising issues, and cultivate an environment that is conducive to sustainable investment and growth.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0Dr Bipin Adhikari is a constitutional expert and is currently associated with the Kathmandu University School of Law.

The paramount leader proved true to his words; he later shook hands even with the archenemies of China, focused on his goal of steering the country to the summit of economic prosperity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn countries like Nepal, much time, energy and other resources are wasted debating on ideologies. Cadres of political parties debate on socialism, capitalism, communism, etc. often even without having the slightest idea of what these terminologies actually mean. There are heated arguments on Hinduism and secularism, and games of maligning other political parties as pro-India or pro-China.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the people, no matter whether the government stands on the ideology of communism or democracy, as long as it can deliver development, provide quality health and education facilities and the right to freely prosper, it is a good government. Deng Xiaoping, who was vehemently driven by great insight, set his eyes only on the prosperity of China and switched even Mao Zedong’s system of State Controlled Economy to Market Freedom. As a result, China basked in the phenomenal economic growth rate averaging 6 percent for 30 years.\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal should stop engaging in futile discussions of ideology, religion and identity superiority, and focus on expanding the economy and augmenting development activities. Many young Nepalis are forced to join pathetic labor markets around the world and it is a matter of pity that the government rejoices in remittance. When the governments in the struggling countries lack resources and are unable to stir economic activities and create jobs, they can compensate by encouraging entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship empowers people, which in turn promotes a nation.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmid foreign startups like OYO hotels - turned into mega business within a matter of a few mere years - entering the Nepali market with vigor, the government should produce a conducive environment for strongly motivated young Nepali entrepreneurs for the country to be unbeaten in the race of manufacturing ideas in own ground. Given the right environment, Nepali citizens too can spawn new ideas and contribute to the economy. They too can create software and applications to be installed in mobiles, computers and other appliances, which more importantly, will be distinctive to the Nepali soil. In China, undoubtedly, the visionary leader Xiaoping, who set the goals of ‘The Four Modernizations’ in agriculture, industry, defense, and science and technology, is the paramount reason behind the country’s miraculous transformation. He set the bed, which stimulates entrepreneurship in the young Chinese population today. As such, it should not be surprising that 40 percent of the university goers in China graduate with engineering and science degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor achieving the goals of creating entrepreneurship driven society, the government should raise awareness about the importance of entrepreneurial mindset connecting it to rewards of economic prosperity and empowerment. Schools, colleges and universities can be the cradle for cultivating such a mindset. Regardless of the majors the students take, they should be mandated to take at least one subject which teaches them entrepreneurship and provides foundational knowledge on innovation, technology, and financial management. All university degrees should be awarded only after the students have fulfilled internships and project works, carrying 50 percent weight of the entire academic work.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government has to adopt very systematic and scientific methods for the protection of intellectual properties of patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, etc. This raises awareness about the value of intelligence and inspires creativity and entrepreneurship. The government should facilitate easy registration of companies cutting off unnecessary regulations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing the government can do is vigorously run incubation centers, as many as possible, under municipal and village development offices. In biology, incubators are places where young ones are hatched and nurtured. Incubation centers will serve a similar purpose for the startups. They will provide information about processes of obtaining seed money, link entrepreneurs to financial institutions, help to seek angel investors and venture capitalists, help in the regulation of financial activities and management of the intellectual property. They can also help in market research.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, to sustain entrepreneurship, the government should assist in creation and management of investment. Tax rebates and other incentives can be extended to financial institutions that invest and help to accelerate the growth of startups. In China and other innovation-driven countries, when any startups show promises of making big, the government agencies are keen to fund them. Appropriate rules and regulations propitious to small individual investors and venture capitalists should be formulated.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany of the times media houses are accused of spreading negativities. The government can impel media houses to dissipate stories that stimulate entrepreneurship culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne does not always need a big idea like that of Mark Zuckerberg for entrepreneurial achievement. With the right idea, even something as simple as selling coffee can be turned into a multibillion-dollar business, which happened with Starbucks. Moreover, in Nepal, there are plenty of stories like simple common women producing selroti to sell massively at departmental stores and uneducated men employing innovative ideas to generate high yields in agriculture, which engendered great economic transformations in their lives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is time Nepal assimilated ‘Deng Xiaoping’s good cat’ principle and focused on actions that foster development and economic prosperity relinquishing vague unending debates of ideology, religion and identity politics. The government should engage to achieve the real goal i.e., the empowerment of people and economic exuberance. One of the genuine ways to do so will be vitalizing entrepreneurship.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\n                            The International Migrants Day on December 18, 2018 is being observed in the wake of the endorsement of the UN Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration in Marrakesh, Morocco. Defying a fierce criticism from the United States and some other countries, 164 UN member states have adopted the Compact– containing 23 objectives and 187 actions– at the Marrakesh summit on December 11, 2018. Over 20 countries including the United States, Australia and some EU member states have vocally denounced the Compact while 30 other countries did not attend the summit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Compact, which is framed as “a cooperative framework”, is the first-ever global attempt to foster collective international cooperation to better address the complex issues facing the world’s 258 million migrants. The global politics and public opinions at large are vertically split over the Compact’s content, preceding and following its final adoption. The critics see the Compact as an infringement on state sovereignty while others tend to embrace a highly optimistic view of the Compact and consider it as a landmark achievement and the beginning of a new era in international migration governance. Then yet another discourse is skeptic and downplays the Compact as a futile endeavor and a run-of-the-mill document that is highly inspirational but lacking in its implementability. Legally non-binding though the Compact is, while the major challenges confronted by the world’s migrants result largely from instruments and structures embedded in the states’ national socio-political paradigms, the Compact still carries enormous normative significance, particularly for migrant-sending countries such as Nepal.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe critics opposing the Compact argue that it infringes upon national sovereignty and fear that it could lead to an influx of migrants into their countries, dilute their countries’ character, import crime and poverty, reduce wages and take jobs from tax-paying citizens. Some critics have gone so far as to call it a ‘dystopian' UN plan to erase borders, undermine the rule of law and circumvent state sovereignty. The United States, for instance, was the first country to pull out of the Compact in December 2017, calling it “an effort by the United Nations to advance global governance at the expense of the sovereign right of states.” Australia and some countries from the European Union also followed suit. The Compact, however, clearly aims to “foster international co-operation among all relevant actors on migration,” while upholding “the sovereignty of states.” The Compact reaffirms States’ sovereign rights to determine their national migration policies and to govern migration within their national jurisdictions. Neither does the Compact impose multilateralism in migration governance in lieu of the countries’ national policies. Moreover, the Compact adopts a multi-scalar approach to international migration governance, leaving it up to the states to consider whatever governance models better suit their priorities: bilateral, multilateral, regional, or otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome enthusiasts of the Compact portray it more as a panacea to all the existing challenges within international migration and praise it for encompassing issues such as labor rights, use of migration detention, human trafficking, access to social services, xenophobia, recognition of skills and professional qualifications, remittance repatriation, and climate change as a driver of displacement. Comprehensive though it is in incorporating diverse dimensions of migration, the Compact nonetheless cannot be considered a paradigm shift in international migration governance in that it does not oblige states to take measurable concrete actions. Addressing the Marrakesh conference Minister for Labor, Employment and Social Welfare, Gokarna Bista acclaimed the Compact for placing ‘the human rights of migrants at the center.’ Although the Compact considers individual migrants as the subject, not the object, of the migration governance modalities, it shies away from placing the individual migrants at the center of the migration governance discourse. The Compact is indeed a diplomatically balanced document that strikes a delicate balance between migrants’ rights and the sensitivity and sovereignty of the States. Finally, the third discourse on the Compact considers it as a mere toothless document and raises questions on its applicability and ability to create substantive improvements in the lived-experiences of migrants, since states can easily ignore it due to its legally non-binding nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Compact is a political declaration and a cooperative framework; it however fills the void in global migration governance and thus carries important normative significance. The Compact is the first ever agreement negotiated between the UN member states on what Louise Arbour calls ‘an issue that was long seen as out-of-bounds for a truly concerted global effort’ and that covers all dimensions of international migration in a comprehensive manner.’ The Compact is thus an important step forward but not a transformational document that calls for a paradigmatic shift. Amidst the current global politics characterized by contradictory forces of increasing interdependence and networks as well as jingoism and jealous guarding of nationalism, the Compact carries a far-reaching normative significance in the governance of international migration. Also, in such a political milieu an international agreement of non-binding nature such as the Compact could even be more effective than the hard laws.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Compact is neither a threat to national sovereignty in the manner in which some countries and ultra-right-wing political forces have depicted it as, and nor is it a panacea to all the ills in international migrations as conceived by some idealists. It is therefore up to the states and their political leaderships to tap into the Compact for their common benefits, be it through bilateral or regional initiatives.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0(Hari KC is a doctoral candidate in Global Governance at the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Waterloo, Canada)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\n                            Ram Bir Manandhar who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) from Kathmandu-7 has announced resignation. He has declared that he resigned to get Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) leader Bam Dev Gautam elected. CPN has yet to take a decision on Manandhar's resignation and giving ticket to Gautam. We want to ask the CPN leadership the following five questions before it takes that decision.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Voters in Kathmandu-7 have got Manandhar elected to the parliament for five years. He is resigning less than a year into his five-year term. What is the reason behind his digression?\\r\\n\\r\\nManandhar has argued that the country will be developed if Gautam gets to the parliament. There is not even a trace of truth in this claim. The confidence with which he gave this false reason during the press conference proved that he was not worthy of people's trust in the first place.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany suspect that this resignation episode is related to personal development of Manandhar and not that of the country. Many estimate that his resignation is connected to financial benefits, and assurances of National Assembly membership and a ministerial berth. CPN must investigate, if it is unaware of these estimates and suspicions, why Manandhar turned his back on the voters' faith on him and the party. We firmly believe that a few leaders and lawmakers can digress sometimes but the whole party should not be part of that digression.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Top leaders could contest from more than one constituency until the election in 2013. Such exploitative practice is rare in any democracy and was vehemently opposed right from the beginning. But many leaders worked hard to retain that provision amidst all the opposition. The leaders rejected by the voters of one constituency got to the parliament riding on the back of votes from another. Those who won from both the constituencies relinquished one later. By-elections had to be held there spending the taxpayers' money. The state's resources were wasted and the voters suffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provision was removed in the latest general election after efforts of years. Holding a by-election in Kathmandu-7 to get Gautam elected spending tens of millions from the state coffers would mean undoing that reform.\\r\\n\\r\\nUndoing such reforms would be a disgrace to democracy and system. This will increase public disenchantment toward democracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMuch more qualified leaders have lost election before Gautam. Sage leader and the then prime minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai lost in the first general election after restoration of democracy in 1990 to general secretary of the then CPN-UML Madan Bhandari. He was the tallest among the politicians who contested the general election due to his political contribution from the time of Rana regime, determination to fight the Panchayat regime staying in Nepal, leading role in promulgation of the constitution a year earlier and his simple life and great intellect. But he lost the election. There were talks within Nepali Congress (NC) and outside about taking him to the parliament even by vacating a constituency. Many NC lawmakers were ready to resign for Bhattarai. But Bhattarai refused. Democracy's dignity was saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nGautam is hell-bent on demolishing that dignity. His thinking can be read on the basis of the restlessness that always drives him. But can that restlessness and personal ambition overshadow the behemoth that CPN is, and its government with two-third majority?\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The world did not end when Krishna Prasad Bhattarai did not get to the parliament and it will definitely not end when Gautam is not in one. Gautam is among leaders with many weaknesses among contemporary politicians in stark contrast to the tall stature and impeccable conduct that Bhattarai had among his peers. Abuse of power and position, alliance with power centers and bad governance have been the hallmark of Gautam's politics.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was implicated in the gold smuggling scam when he first became home minister. A parliamentary probe committee clearly hinted at his complicity in the scam. The malpractice of smuggling gold through the Tribhuvan International Airport was institutionally established during his term. Gautam and the late NC leader Khum Bahadur Khadka have played a leading role in getting that malpractice established. The recently published biography of former IGP Achyut Krishna Kharel proves that further.\\r\\n\\r\\nGautam showed no signs of improvement when he last became home minister in the Sushil Koirala government. He took a stand to promote corrupt and badly-performing DIGs to AIGs. That ultimately led to appointment of an unprecedented seven AIGs in Nepal Police and the number of AIGs increased to 13 after the court ordered appointment of another six.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany shady political developments in Nepal further stigmatize the conduct of politicians. Appointment of Lokman Singh Karki as the chief commissioner of the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) was one such incident. The greatest interest behind Karki's appointment at the CIAA was that of the Indian intelligence agency. Many NC and communist leaders opposed that and many supported it. Many feigned ignorance for tacit support while some played a major role in appointing Karki as the chief commissioner of CIAA. Gautam was one among the latter ones. For which relation and to fulfill whose interest was he mobilized then?\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticians un/knowingly make many mistakes in a long political career. It is not possible to dig all of those mistakes and that takes us nowhere. But how can CPN move forward if the leaders with such weaknesses are repeatedly revived and get to dominate the party and stymie the growth of capable leaders of the next generation? How will democracy flourish?\\r\\n\\r\\n4. We have yet to be told why Gautam wants to become a lawmaker by removing another elected one. The reason for his insistence is yet to be known. His claims make one feel that the government cannot work and the party cannot function without him in the parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave the government, parliament and party really become sluggish because Gautam is not in the parliament? What led Gautam to falsely believe that KP Sharma Oli has not been able to run the government, ministers have failed to govern effectively, and no CPN leader has played an effective role in the parliament, and his mere entry in the parliament will immediately resolve all these problems?\\r\\n\\r\\nThis illusion in itself is Gautam's problem. His illusion will start to destabilize the party and the government from the day he gets elected to the HoR.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe party has yet to take a decision on asking its elected lawmaker to resign. The decision to ask Gautam contest the by-election also has not been made. But he has already made Manandhar announce resignation through unscrupulous maneuvers. One chairman has already read Manandhar's resignation letter in the secretariat meeting. What does this forebode?\\r\\n\\r\\n5. The by-election in Kathmandu-7 will be a virtual referendum on the government if the party somehow accepts Manandhar resignation and Gautam contests in the by-election. The by-election will be an opportunity for the voters to express their displeasure over betrayal by Manandhar and the preliminary performance of the government. We don't believe Gautam will win the by-election. Our interaction with 51 voters in the constituency hints so. Gautam's loss in the by-election will be a big psychological setback for the government and party. The party will be mired in internal bickering and the government will be destabilized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe left alliance contested the last election under Oli's leadership and the mandate is for him to lead the government for five years. Destabilizing that will not just be a loss for the party but also be detrimental to the country.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe believe the CPN government is already reactionary and is unnecessarily defensive. The government has yet to be familiar with governance. But the government has an unwarranted feeling of guilt about not being able to perform. It has hardly been behind the wheel for six months and it has time to learn from its experience, mend its ways and make itself effective. Results of good works done by some ministries will come in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, therefore, firmly believe this is not a time to risk a virtual referendum. It is time for the government and party to focus on work without letting Gautam's unfulfilled political ambitions cast a shadow on itself. What does the CPN leadership think?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n                            Our attention has been drawn to some provisions related to doctors and health practitioners in the new General Criminal Code that came into effect from first Bhadra, 2075 (August 17, 2018).\\r\\n\\r\\nClause 230 (1) and (2) is full of flaws. It seems that people who do not know anything about medical science have proposed the clause. In fact, it can take many individuals lives. There is nothing small or big in medicine. One tablet can cause anaphylaxis or one surgical incision can cut nerve or artery or even cause septicemia.\\r\\n\\r\\nMedical error has been defined as an unintended act or one that does not achieve its intended outcome, the failure of a planned action to be completed as intended (an error of execution), the use of a wrong plan to achieve an aim (an error of planning), or a deviation from the process of care that may or may not cause harm to the patient. Heart ailments cause 611 thousand, cancer 585 thousand and medical errors 251 thousand deaths, according to statistics from US Hospitals for 2013.\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at clause 230 (3) and (4), any of us can be in prison from three years to whole life.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippocratic Oath prohibits all of us from treating any patient with wrong intention. If we do so, we are not physicians. In that situation, our license has to be confiscated by the council or other regulatory bodies.\\r\\n\\r\\nHippocratic Oath today binds the American Medical Association’s Code of Medical Ethics (1996) and has remained a benchmark for ideal conduct of the physicians in the Western Civilization. In reality, oath-taking in recent decades has risen with almost 100 percent of US medical schools administering the oath today from just 24% in 1928.\\r\\n\\r\\nClause 231 (2) a and b treat malicious treatment by physicians like murders. They state that no physician will treat maliciously, and the physician’s license will be confiscated if there is any concern and complaint about malicious treatment. I have never heard and read about any physician treating maliciously in my life. How can a patient go to a physician who is treating maliciously?\\r\\n\\r\\nClause 232 talks about medical negligence. Is it medical error or is it a different thing? If we talk about medical error as medical negligence, there will be no space left in the country’s prisons and there will be no doctors left in the hospitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nNobody has discussed, what happens if doctors or nurses die while treating patients with hepatitis, swine flu, AIDS and other ailments or doctors develop bone marrow cancer due to over exposure to radiation or oncologists die due to chemotherapy preparations or pathologists die due to liver pathology secondary to formaldehyde solution.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have not discussed doctors and nurses having mental and physical breakdown due to long hours of stressful work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, this law has been put forward without enough homework and no stakeholder was invited in the discussion process. It is still not too late to correct it. I am sure with the able leadership of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, this problem can be corrected once and for all.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe discussion, in my view, has to be focused on how to produce able doctors, how to provide life-long education, how to participate in maintenance of certification, how to do clinical and basic science research, how to make better hospitals where doctors can perform best surgeries, treat patients in the best possible way, and how to build safe institution.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems our focus has deviated from the main goal. Let physicians and allied specialties come together to show the correct path and solidarity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also love our patients and country as much as other people do. Let us not corner the practitioners of this noble profession. We may have weaknesses, like any other human being, but these all are correctable. No doctors should be in the prison to correct medical errors.\\r\\n\\r\\n(The author is Medical Director at Grande International Hospital)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            I, as an exiled Bhutanese citizen, prisoner of conscience, human rights activist, and elected public representative from southern Bhutan to the National Assembly from 1973 to 1984 and royal advisory councillor elected by the National Assembly of Bhutan on 30th November 1984, would humbly like to put down the following points for Your Excellency\\'s kind consideration.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil early 1980s, all the Bhutanese citizens were living happily and in harmony but in 1988 there was a drastic change in the attitude of Bhutanese Government. New rules and regulations were introduced with the rhetoric of \"One Nation One People\" that particularly affected the Lotshampas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Citizenship Act 1958, passed by the resolution of National Assembly of Bhutan was revoked and a new Citizenship Act 1985 was implemented, without the consent of the National Assembly, with a strong intention of making as many Lotshampas stateless as possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, as a responsible public representative, I reported about this grievous national issue to the king for rational justification. But, to utter surprise of the most southern Bhutanese, the king ordered my arrest. I was detained in police custody, where I was inhumanly humiliated and tortured. I was released on the third day after a written agreement that prevented me from meeting more than three persons at a time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I started feeling trepidation in my own motherland, I was compelled to enter India and then to Nepal for safety and security. Eight months later I was kidnapped from Nepal by Mr. V. Namgyal, the then ADC to the king of Bhutan, and taken back to Bhutan where I was jailed in isolation, and physically and mentally tortured for a decade. I was declared to be innocent and released on 17th December 1999 due to lack of any evidence against me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I was released from the physical chains, and came out of the high four walls of the dark jail, I still feel trapped in the chains of multiple maladies. That torture, that anguish I suffered while in detention continues to haunt me to this day.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Bhutan, people of Nepalese origin were living in the southern region of the country since early 17th century. And, they comprised more than one sixth of the total population of Bhutan.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince late 1980s the regime started to allege this community, Lotshmpas, of being illegal immigrants after implementing the new laws, and prioritized “Tibetan-based Bhutanese culture” to antagonize minority ethnic-Nepalese community. Nepali language was banned in schools, a slightly modified Tibetan dress code was promoted as Bhutanese dress code, the Driglam Namzha, was enforced on the general public, and all types of Nepali costumes worn by Lotshampas were banned.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeside all these, the atrocities went to the extreme when the Government of Bhutan closed down 66 schools in the southern belt and converted them to temporary army barracks. Harassment, arbitrary arrests, detentions, burning of Lotshampas\\'s houses and rapes by government machinery were rampant. People were killed in jails during interrogations and torture. Thousands of them were evicted mostly at night and that too during the mid-monsoon season, intentionally done so to hide the heinous crime of the regime on its innocent citizens from the notice of international media and human rights groups.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch adamant stance of the regime compelled the Lotshampas to organize peaceful mass rallies in all the southern districts to draw the government’s attention. But the government reacted by capriciously snatching the nationality of genuine Lotshampas and all their movable and immovable properties, and rendered them stateless.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the late 1990s Lotshampa refugees began entering Nepal. The Government of Bhutan then started to distribute thus robbed and snatched properties of the Lotshampas to the royal family, some civil administrators, militias and the soldiers who were involved in all those killings and torture.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Lotshampas, who stayed behind in Bhutan, resisted the atrocities of regime but their citizenship certificates have been revoked and they were/are not allowed to take part in elections.\\r\\n\\r\\nBhutan’s citizenship laws state that the persons who have left the country of their own volition, without the knowledge or permission of the government would not be considered citizens of the country. This law was imposed merely to sideline the genuine Bhutanese of Nepalese ethnicity, the Lotshamphas. Exiled Bhutanese are not allowed to meet with their relatives back in Bhutan even to attend funeral rites.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe international community and the government of Nepal tried, and are trying their best, to repatriate the genuine Bhutanese to their country Bhutan, though many refugees were compelled to resettle in the third countries against their will due to the adamant stand of the Bhutanese regime and fading basic facilities provided to the refugees in the camps. And such situation has divided the Lotshamphas community both in exile and inside Bhutan. Solving the Bhutanese refugee issue just by resettling them in the third countries, as presumed by the international community, is going to be more shame than reality, and such move has definitely helped and encouraged the Bhutanese regime to evict more Lotshampas from Bhutan in future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this pathetic background of the Bhutanese refugee, the international community should play an important role for execution of the basic human rights and to guarantee those rights which the Constitution of Bhutan guarantees. There are almost 10,000 Bhutanese refugees in the refugee camps in Nepal. The international community should play a role to repatriate them to their homeland with all safety, security and dignity.\\r\\n\\r\\nApart from this, there are hundreds of Lotshampas in the prisons of Bhutan without judicial trial. The Government of Bhutan is treating them as criminals even though they are not. They are human rights activists and the government should treat them as prisoners of conscience.\\r\\n\\r\\nThousands of Lotshampas residing in Bhutan are deprived of basic civil rights. They are not allowed to take part in elections and even their properties are confiscated by the government. I, therefore, appeal for their safety, and their human rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a member of the UN, Bhutan needs to guarantee the rights guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). Article 5 of UDHR guarantees the rights of a person against torture, and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Article 9 of UDHR guarantees the rights against arbitrary arrest, detention or exile, and the rights of nationality for everyone have been guaranteed in Article 15 (1).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe property rights have been enshrined in Article 17 (2) which reads ‘No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.’ However, these rights have remained only in the documents and ethnic-Nepalese Bhutanese are deprived of these rights.\\r\\n\\r\\nBhutan ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Child on 1st August 1990. It has to implement the CRC provisions. Article 7 states ‘The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and, as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents.’\\r\\n\\r\\nAs a state party, Bhutan too must ensure the implementation of these rights, but the refugee children are deprived of the rights enshrined in the CRC and its two protocols ratified by Bhutan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe list of people involved in killing, rape, arson, eviction, torture, extrajudicial killing, shooting, plundering of properties, distribution of thus plundered properties among the partners in crime, prevention of repatriation, etc., are included but not limited to the following people only.\\r\\n\\r\\nList of Royal Family \\r\\n\\r\\nKing

       "  '\\n                            August 18, 2008--10 years ago to the day--the day is remembered for two reasons; first, Pushpa Kamal Dahal assuming office of the Prime minister (PM) and second, the catastrophic disaster of Koshi river that devastated the lives of millions in Nepal and India. A decade since, Nepal has adopted a federal republic system while Dahal has transformed his identity as the joint chairman (along with the current PM KP Sharma Oli) of the largest party of Nepal but sadly, the fate of the Koshi river and the people living along its banks have largely remained unchanged. While many of us might have erased the tragic event from our memory, for the thousands of people in the adjoining villages, it has left a haunting memory for the years to come.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat caused the disaster?\\r\\n\\r\\nKoshi channel is confined between the two giant embankments about 4.5 meters high on both the banks right from the Koshi barrage to the upstream (32 km on left bank and 25 km on the right including downstream). These embankments are primarily made from earthen materials (clay, sand or silt) which cannot withstand the high stress that the river flow exerts. So to prevent potential erosion and damage to these embankments, structures called spurs are constructed. These structures protect the embankment by deflecting the high-velocity flow away from the embankments toward the channel.\\xa0 However, during this process, there is a high risk that these spurs will themselves get eroded because they too are made from earthen materials with some gabion protection around the tip where the impact of flow is maximum. Once these spurs start eroding, there is a high possibility that they will be washed away in no time. So what exactly happened during the 2008 Koshi flood disaster?\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_128229\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"826\"] Inundated Jamuwa and Kushaha Village. Photo Credit: Basistha Raj[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to the long-term westward shifting trend of the Koshi, the flow had been concentrated along the eastern embankment for a couple of years. Being a wide river (as wide as 11km at some sections), Koshi contains multiple channels (braided) across its width and the river discharge is not uniformly distributed among these channels. One of the channels acts as a primary channel with a major proportion of the river discharge flowing through it. Between 11 to 14 km upstream of Koshi barrage, the majority of the flow was concentrated along the eastern embankment in the early August of 2008 (can be seen on satellite images, USGS). Some damage to the spurs at these locations were noticed few days ahead of the disaster (Sinha, 2008). In fact, these locations were identified as vulnerable a year before the disaster. A timely repair could have averted this tragedy, experts say. Prof. Sinha from IIT, Kanpur termed it more as a technical and administrative carelessness rather than a disaster.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe treaty on Koshi consigns the overall management (including the maintenance and repair) of the barrage and embankment to the Government of India. Since the completion of the embankment in 1963, a total of eight major incidents of embankment failure have occurred. However, 2008 was the first instance where the embankment upstream of the barrage was breached. Eventually the magnitude of the damage was also greater compared to the previous instances.\\r\\n\\r\\nLessons still unlearned\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disaster of 2008 occurred at a discharge four-five times below for which the barrage is designed for. The problem of Koshi, as many of us might think, is not only the large volume of water it brings in the monsoon but also the high proportion of sediments that it carries. Koshi is one of the rivers with highest sediment load in the world. The high volume of sediments that it transports from the upper catchment area, gets deposited in the lower reach due to the reduced gradient of the river which causes a change in the river morphology. Various studies have suggested that in the post-embankment period, the river bed has been consistently aggrading resulting in the reduction of channel capacity. The embankment on Koshi has outlived its effective lifespan; only trying to strengthen or heighten the embankment will rather amplify the flood risk. At the time when embankment on Koshi was being planned, Bihar chief engineer GF Hall mentioned that ‘embankment don’t control floods, they merely transfer the problem from one place to another’ (Dixit, 2008).\\xa0 According to DK Mishra, an expert on Koshi flood issues, the flood-prone areas in Bihar have increased to nearly three folds since the implementation of embankments. Similarly, studies on Mississippi River, USA have shown that the efforts to tame the river through embankments have made it more feral. Such issues have left a serious question among us: Do embankments really control floods? Our conventional perspective of viewing the river system as consisting of a mere cubic meter of water needs to be changed. From a narrow hydrological perspective, the focus should be shifted to a broader and dynamic hydro-geomorphological approach which considers the linkage between water and sediments in the river processes. For example, the intake of Sunsari-Morang Irrigation Project near Chatara once had already been shifted to a new location as a result of the change in the river morphology which abated the withdrawal of design discharge. Similar problem has arisen again recently and the study is ongoing for the next alternative. This is just a case on how the geomorphological factors can impact the water-related projects and implies a strong lesson for integrating these factors in the future projects. ‘Rivers are the mirror of their watershed’ goes a saying. The high volume of sediments carried by Koshi indicates an excessive erosion in the upstream watershed which can be attributed to (but not limited to) unscientific human interventions. Any efforts to managing the river in the downstream area, must take into account these upstream dynamics. JICA in its Master Plan on Koshi, 1985 also clearly manifested the watershed management in the Koshi basin as an integral component of the water resources development. Meanwhile, Water Resources Ministry in India has already started drafting a policy for sediment management on its river systems for the sustainability of river environment and related projects.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_128232\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"826\"] Villagers trying to evacuate to safety. Photo Credit: Basistha Raj[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat next?\\r\\n\\r\\nDisasters don’t come ringing an alarm bell. The 2008 disaster should have instigated an urgency for the long-term solutions to Koshi flood problems but the sad fact, no step has been taken in that direction. In fact, the barrage and embankments were envisioned just as a short-term mitigation measure while the recurrent disasters in the past have long prompted for an alternative approach. And any attempt to find a one-stop solution will again be a big mistake. The dynamic nature of overall Koshi basin and its river system demands the shift from traditionally practiced ‘river control’ approach to the broader ‘river management’ approach which considers the multi-dimensional aspects of a river system. The planning and decision processes need to be based on sufficient scientific data backed up by rigorous research. Although some non-governmental research institutions have intensified their activities in the recent times, research works within the government institutions are almost nonexistent.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_128230\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"724\"] Satellite image showing Koshi River, Barrage and the breach portion.[/caption]\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother hindrance in the planning or research process is the lack of data. Sufficient network of data measurement stations needs to be established to better represent the spatial heterogeneity of the basin which is crucial in understanding the underlying physical processes in the basin. Being a trans-boundary river, it might be inevitable in the future to form a common portal for data and information sharing between upstream and downstream nations. A high-level commission on Koshi basin (or a river basin authority) comprising of a panel of experts may be formed to reassess the future perspective on the overall water resource management of Koshi basin taking a lesson from the past pitfalls. The talk on the development of inland and trans-boundary navigation system has already gained momentum. It would be better if we proceed with the overall basin development plan and deal with navigational aspect as an integral part of the overall plan. However, there is status quo bias between what is desirable and what is viable.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere cannot be a better way of achieving prosperity than through optimum use of water resources. The goal might not be achieved overnight but at a time when we have a stable political scenario under a strong government, the foundation can certainly be laid in the right direction. We have talked the talk for far too long. It is time to walk the talk.\\r\\n\\r\\n[caption id=\"attachment_128231\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"826\"] Upstream view of Koshi Barrage during monsoon.

       "  \"\\nWhile I was lingering on the search box of my computer, I thought of typing “word” in it. But, accidentally, I typed “white”. Typing error is a common thing, but what I typed was not so common. The thought travelled intermittently inside my mind. Questions jumbled here and there. But, deep down, a question was torturing me—Why I chose white, why not any other word starting with the letter “W”? The answer lies within me and us—within our system—schooling and socio-behavioral malpractice.\\nSuddenly I thought, white has no whiteness unless it jostles with blackness, or yellowness. The structuralists explicated similar thoughts many years ago by saying everything has two poles; white-black, water-land, male-female, and these poles are called as binary oppositions. But, by giving the divergent idea, Jacques Derrida – pioneer critic of deconstruction, explained about binary oppositions by saying ‘one of the two terms govern the another”. So, we can simply say, in the case of racism white governs black. The root lies here.\\nSociologist William Julius Wilson defined racism as an ideology of domination. First, I think, we have to understand about the racial inequality and racial discrimination. Suddenly I remembered Devah Pager and Hana Shepherd, saying racial inequality concerns about unequal outcomes in income, education and health. Whereas, racial discrimination concerns about unequal treatment of races. These two factors combine as racism. So, racism is not just a term used for the discrimination on the basis of color between people, rather, it is about the whole socio-economic agenda of people living in the society.\\nA Problem of Past\\nWhen Christopher Columbus stepped into America in 1492, people were already there. But, white-privilege claimed that Columbus discovered America. Till now, we read that false history. Ian Haney Lopez, writer and professor at the University of California, claims: construction of racism started from 1492. During 1500-1619, first Africans were brought to America. The root of racism inside America started to flourish from\\xa0The Naturalization Act of 1790 which naturalized white people as free white person with good moral character.\\nIn contrast, racism started in Europe from the Middle Ages. Historical documents reported in European History Online explains that: xenophobia was persistent during ancient Greek civilization. During the Middle Ages, black Muslims were treated as uncivilized and were disregarded from white Christians. Though, European Christianity has some black martyrs like Gereon and Mauritius. During colonization, black people were brought to Europe from Africa for slavery, racism started from there. European practice of racism can be seen in these two old advertisements of Pears’ soap.\\n\\n\\nVintage Advertisement of Pears' Soap in Europe; Credit: Pinterest/fid.moda\\nHistory of racism in Europe was not only Afrophobia but was Antisemitism also. The horrendous crime of the Holocaust committed during the Second World War was also a practice of racism. Around six million Jews were murdered systematically during the Holocaust. The cynical idea of Hitler’s thought on racism created mass killings in Europe which will always give pain to humanity.\\nNepal, too, hasn’t been untouched with racism. Many among the majorities in Nepal, do not consider minorities as their people. Upendra Yadav, leader of the then Sanghiya Samajwadi Forum in an interview to Aljazeera in 2015 said: “The mainstream Nepali parties don’t consider tarai people as their own,” this statement hints toward the racial inequality practised in Nepal. The dark-skinned people of tarai, typically known as “Madhesis” are racially discriminated in Nepal as outsiders—especially as Indians. The main agenda of three ‘Mahesh Movements’ in 2007, 2008 and 2015 was to restore the rights of Madhesis who were racially discriminated in Nepal.\\nA Problem of Present\\nNowadays, the world is saddened with the tragic death of George Floyd, an African-American who died last week after being pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer with his knee on Floyd's neck even as three fellow officers remained bystanders. The officer held his knee for nearly nine minutes, on the video captured of the incident. Floyd pleads “I can’t breathe” but to no avail. Protests have been triggered not only inside America but around the world. Black people are again demanding for their equality enshrined in the Constitution and the American Declaration of Independence that states 'All men are created equal.'\\nA Statista (data gathering website) statistic shows that a black American is 2.5 times more likely to get killed by the police than a white American. Similarly, in Brazil, homicides rates per 100,000 black or brown people increased from 32.42 in 2006 to 43.15 in 2007. These numbers show us that people from minority race die more despite being less in number. The white privilege in education system also discourages the minorities; racial minorities are less likely to achieve a degree than the majority whites. David Wellman describes white privilege as a system of advantage based on race. The world is dominated by this white privilege which needs to be confronted.\\nSimilarly, racism persists in the healthcare system too. \\xa0COVID-19, according to BBC News, causes more deaths in racial and ethnic minorities because they don’t have healthcare access and facilities. In Britain, black British and ethnic minorities die 50 per cent more than white British people due to COVID-19. Similarly, in Brazil, deaths are more reported among blacks living in favelas (slums). The idea of racism is not about discrimination about color but about having access to the facilities given by nation and country.\\nWhat in Future?\\nThe word racism is a dirty word today. A racist person gets punished more because of the law. A white woman called police to arrest a black man who asked her to leash her dog in the Central Park of New York as required by the rules. She was later fired from her job with the employers stating that such racism cannot be tolerated. The majority in Nepal are also getting closer to ethnic Madhesi people and respecting them in comparison to the past. Education and awareness are changing people’s thoughts. But, cases of racial discrimination still remain in the world.\\nThe idea of white privilege cannot be eradicated in the blink of an eye. The world needs to create equality in inequalities such as: education, healthcare, socioeconomic and other outcomes. People should not be differentiated on the basis of their color. The reason behind my typing white while meaning word is the white privilege which entered into my unconscious through the socio-economic and education system. There are many “I” in the world who practice this white privilege. Unless we reform the society to create equality, more George Floyds will suffer in the future and the ugly practice of racism will persist.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nIn Nepal, the government-imposed lockdown seems to have taken a longer route with no alternatives left alongside. The increasing cases of COVID-19, with each passing day, have caused dismay and trepidation among the general public. The pandemic has been dominating the headlines for months, traumatizing the general public with fear of infection and death. Although this disease hit the globe as a fast-spreading and ruinous viral infection, lately it is not concealed from the general public, as experts in diverse fields of study have strongly indicated, that this health crisis can soon ravage our economic system and abet a famine. This article is mainly focused on analyzing the preparedness of Nepal, a least-developed country, to deal with a food crisis amidst a pandemic; with a crashed economy, import dependency and a fragile supply chain, while millions of its citizens working in the Middle East and neighboring India are losing their jobs and returning home.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nCOVID-19 has global consequences\\xa0\\nAccording to the new figures from the World Food Program, over a quarter of billion people around the world may face acute hunger by the end of 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. That figure nearly amounts to double the number of 135 million people who currently face acute hunger as per the Global Report on World Food Crisis 2020 in 55 countries just before the pandemic. So it is likely that the problem that arose as a health crisis at the beginning of 2020 will bring about a global food security crisis by the end of this year. Political activist Marcus Garvey said 'Hungry men have no respect for the law, authority or human life' and that has been recently proved by the protest in Chilean capital Santiago amidst the lockdown. The reason behind the protest is said to be hunger and unemployment. Recently, similar instances are being reported from different parts of the world.\\n\\xa0Our bitter reality\\nNepal has yet to be self-sufficient in food production despite being called an agricultural country. Although, about two-third of the population is engaged in agriculture, the sector’s contribution to the GDP has been only around 27 percentage. In the fiscal year 2018/2019 itself, Nepal imported agricultural and livestock products worth Rs 224 billion. Heavy reliance on import, even for basic foodstuffs for two meals a day, has posed a threat of food scarcity to the government. As the rest of the world is also enforcing lockdown to contain the virus, the strategy of the government to maintain the food supply while the food imports shrink and the supply chain is disconnected, remains the main matter at hand.\\nSocial distancing and lockdown have resulted in fewer laborers in the field to grow, harvest, and process the crops. The crops are rotting in the field as a consequence. Further, the seeds, pesticides, fertilizers are not easily accessible to the farmers, adding more problems to crop sowing in the upcoming season. The disturbances in movement of food containers and trucks, and extending border delays have also resulted in spoilage of perishable products. The limited supply of goods has already led to an increase in the cost of those stuffs, while the purchasing power of general people is decreasing, which might further worsen the situation.\\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0\\nAnguish of citizens\\nDespite the coronavirus spreading worldwide affecting the whole of humanity, it also brought the social disparity between the rich and the poor to the fore. The poor are the ones most affected by the virus who are going hungry. In Nepal, there are millions of people whose life was already hanging by a thread even before the start of the pandemic. According to World Data Lab, 7% of our population is living in extreme poverty, and the situation is becoming horrendous with each passing minute. The rich people have stocked up the foodstuffs to adjust with the lockdown routines whereas the poor ones have been skipping meals so that the stocks don't run out soon. Recently a story of a Nepali journalist living in isolation hit the social media, depicting the scenario of Nepalis fighting the disease with mere water and biscuits. Poor nutrition and resulting weaker immunity leaves people of any age group vulnerable to many more diseases.\\nI fail to put into words the condition of many daily wage workers and laborers who have difficulty in feeding their families even once a day. They have battled not only against the deadly virus but also against hunger every moment respecting the laws of the government. How long are the poor supposed to endure the pain and suffering, when the only policy the government is undertaking to tackle the coronavirus is extension of the lockdown?\\nBracing for the future\\nThe pandemic has struck all the economies of the world, as a result many states are limiting their export because of the uncertainty that tomorrow holds. So, it is completely left upon us to take a step to battle out this period.\\nThere has been a drastic change in consumer buying habits, which must be taken into consideration at the moment. The government should prioritize the foodstuffs, and should grant access to them along with other agro inputs. The large area of uncultivated fertile land in the rural areas and the millions of youths returning unemployed from abroad, if articulated together with attractive packages and programs by the government, can not only solve our problem of food shortage and unemployment at present but also pave the way toward food self-sufficient sustainable future. Regarding supply management, e-commerce and the delivery companies could work perfectly fine which is also in consonance with social distancing. Social safety nets or relief packages can be provided to those who are the most vulnerable, which could be granted in the form of either cash or kind. Individuals themselves can play a vital role by avoiding panic buying and hoarding foods.\\nHunger is the ultimate challenge\\nA hungry person cannot distinguish right and wrong and only looks for any way to get food. So will that hungry stomach still follow the government's order of lockdown when the person's own and the family’s life is at stake? The English criminal case of R V Dudley and Stephens showed the situation where the defendants were shipwrecked by a storm and left stranded in an emergency boat for more than 20 days. They then killed a young boy accompanying them to save themselves from starvation. So it cannot be denied that soon we might be forced in such a situation where hunger will make us do things that we never dreamt of. It is the responsibility of not just the government but also of all citizens to protect ourselves and also the ones in need of help during this time of crisis. It is only through collective efforts of all that we can battle out through this pandemic.\\n(The author is a student at Nepal Law Campus, Kathmandu)\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nSt David’s College is a small independent school in North Wales in the United Kingdom. Ordinarily, at this time of year, pupils from St David’s College would be taking part in an adventurous expedition somewhere in the world. From locally, here in Wales to Arctic wildernesses, to African plains – and just about everywhere in between. These pupil-centered expeditions involve journeys using a variety of modes of transport. From exploring on foot, the expeditions may also include sailing boats, canal boats, or travelling self-sufficiently in canoes or sea kayaks. The activities take our pupils to the highest mountain tops and to the lowest depths of caves and mines.\\nExcept this year we can’t. But just as St David’s College has adapted to teaching in the virtual classroom, the headmaster challenged the pupils to join him on the school’s first ever virtual expedition to Nepal – to Mt Everest and help celebrate Everest Day across the globe.\\nSetting off on a journey with an unknown outcome, having the comradery of friends and being part of a team with a shared goal, are always key themes of the school’s \\xa0‘traditional’ expedition model. However, ‘The Headmaster’s Challenge’ and it’s accompanying hashtag ‘#get2everest’ created more successes and benefits and worldwide connections than we could have ever imagined.\\n\\nIt’s the first ever ‘whole school’ physical challenge that has got pupils, parents, staff, brothers and sisters all involved. It’s not a ‘sponsored event’ nor is it a ‘competition’ between pupils and houses. Everyone is encouraged to set their own challenges and it’s up to them to try and achieve them.\\nSo how does it work? At the start of the half-term holiday the Headmaster, Mr Russell, challenged the whole school community to see if we could ‘virtually’ walk, bike, swim, row or run, from St David’s College to Mt Everest in Nepal - a distance of approximately 7,500 kilometers. Utilizing an ‘App’, everyone has been able to log the distances that they have been able to clock up at and around their own homes. A total collective daily distance travelled is then calculated and plotted on a map of the world.\\nEveryone including staff and parents was encouraged to take part and log the exercise distances – no matter how big or small. However, we were soon inundated with requests from past pupils and the wider community if they could join us too.\\nAs we made our virtual journey,the geography department was able to tell us what famous landmarks we would be passing en-route. Almost every department in the school is now part of the challenge. The English department gave us daily facts about authors or scenes from books that we’d pass. History re-lived famous battle grounds and design technology teachers showed us buildings of cultural importance. Art and the chaplaincy showed us how prayer scarfs and flags were made and their significance. Maths kept a close eye on the calculations. Biology showed us the rare and exotic animals that we might come across in the different regions that we travelled through. The cross-curricular list goes on.\\nThe Headmaster’s Challenge has created something incredible that we could all do together while we are apart and as a result has created a community that is thriving on exercise, while learning together along the way. We arrived in Nepal Friday night – perfectly timed to help celebrate ‘Everest Day’ in Nepal.\\n(The author is head of Outdoor Education at the college)\\n\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nHe stood on the hallway of a hospital with a history of two episodes of fever. He was 79 years old. “I live alone. I usually visit my neighborhood friends and spend time with them. I’d frequently attend political group meetings.” he said. After the announcement of nationwide lockdown in Mid-March, he claims he has not visited any religious or political gatherings. He has not mingled with his peers in the Sun. Unidentifiable alien-like people with white gowns, masks and head gears asked him if he had any other symptom. The long hallway of the hospital was filled with people of his age. Some of them were coughing while others just waited for their turn to see the doctor. While he sat there alone, waiting for his test report, he recapped 79 years of his life. His report confirmed that he was negative for SARS-COV-2. But he was not happy. He was still nervous, socially isolated, and lonely.\\nSince December 2019, cases of viral pneumonia caused by the novel coronavirus have been reported all over the world. Even though most of the younger population are affected, the adverse outcomes of COVID-19 have been observed in advanced age. Eight out of ten deaths reported have been in adults over 65 years. COVID-19 undoubtedly affects those with chronic medical conditions such as coronary artery disease, obstructive lung disease or malignancy. The disease usually becomes rampant in care home facilities with old age residents. But, the impact of COVID-19 on the psychology of older adults is under-rated, under-diagnosed and under-treated as the iceberg phenomenon goes.\\nThere is increasing recognition that health of seniors is not only a function of medical variables but also socioeconomic condition, environment, and delivery of health care services. The “Age- friendly domains” by the World Health Organization, 2007 includes: social participation, social inclusion, communication, community support, health services, outdoor spaces, and transportation. COVID-19 has caused absence and unavailability of all these domains, resulting in an \"age-unfriendly” society. We are socially isolating our seniors. There is lack of public transport. Friends and family do not visit their older parents. This might protect them from the virus but will increase mental health problems in the long run.\\nA study done by Santini et al. predicts that social isolation increases depression and anxiety among older adults. Isolation at home brings in a lot of other risks. There is increase in morbidity and all-cause mortality. There is decrease in the physical activities and increase in sedentary time. It can lead to obesity and increased risk of vascular events. Decrease in physical activities also facilitates cognitive decline. It increases risk of falls and associated injuries. They become frailer with each passing day. Lack of daily essential supplies amidst the lockdown adds to the suffering. Older adults are out of daily medication stock due to nationwide lockdown.\\nThere are certain strategies that could be useful though. Telemedicine helps in medical consultations. It is recommended that every older adult should do at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity throughout the week. Nutritious diets should be encouraged via tele-calls. Personal hygiene is to be maintained. Social networking sites with online group calls are some of the ways to keep up their mental spirits. Reading books of religious or political importance is a hobby for some of them. However, about 30 percent of the population of South East Asia is illiterate. Most of them have neither used an internet nor read a newspaper all their lives. There is lack of technological development in our part of the world. And, it is unfortunate that even telephone networks do not prevail in some of the areas.\\nHe visits the nearby grocery shop at 5 PM every day.

       "  \"\\nBanks and other financial institutions were unable to expand their business as the interest rate in loans had increased four times and economic activities had not significantly increased. Returns had decreased significantly. We were hopeful of an economic dispersion after formation of a two-third majority government and political stability. However, the world has been taken aback by a sudden coronavirus crisis. Nepal cannot become an exception during such a crisis. Due to the lockdown, entire economic activities have come to a halt, and therefore, there was no way banks and other financial institutions would be immune to the crisis. Looking at the quarterly report that arrived at mid-April, we can see that banks and other financial institutions have been pushed toward a grave situation. If the government and the central bank are unable to provide aid to these institutions, this industry will face problems which will ultimately make the economy unstable.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nDue to the limited economic activities, the government had previously decreased the expected rate of economic growth, and the Central Bureau of Statistics has further downgraded the projected growth rate to around 2 percent following extended nationwide lockdown. This shows how scary the situation will be. There is a state of confusion as to when the lockdown will end and how we should move ahead with it. Economic activities have remained at a standstill with just emergency and essential services carrying on. People have stopped going to the hospitals even for regular checkup. In absence of any economic activity, a decrease in the banks’ profit was expected. They have not been able to earn back the loan interests. During such circumstances, banks have been forced to manage their loss with provisioning. This was until the April. Lockdown has been extended multiple times since then and it is still unknown when it will end. Due to this, interest collection for the month of Ashadh (ending mid-july) also seems to pose many challenges.\\xa0\\nPublic Health and Economy, both together\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\nThere is no debating the fact that public health and safety is the main priority for the time being. However, in the coming days, the government will have to find a middle point in between public health, pandemic control and economic activities. Staying in a constant state of lockdown can lead to famine and people will start dying not from diseases but due to the unavailability of food. In order to kickstart the economy, the citizens should receive cash or other means of relief. Therefore, in order to relieve banks and other financial institutions from this problem, the government and Nepal Rastra Bank should adhere to a relevant policy.\\nLack of open heart and mind to raise the economy I do not see a possibility of relieving public health and the economy with a simple solution. It is extraordinary time for us and there is no extraordinary cure for it. Kickstarting the economy is the biggest challenge of the current time. Many countries are moving ahead while maintaining a delicate balance. In our country as well, if the government were to invest properly, the economy will rejuvenate and livelihood will carry on as well. We have been facing a lot of loss since the past two months and it is unsure how much we have to face in the near future as there is no way to measure it. A relevant policy is required to counteract this problem. By observing the world economy, the government should increase product consumption.\\nThere is one aspect of the lockdown making the people unemployed and there is another aspect of the food and other products rotting away. Regular consumption materials have not to reached to the consumers. For many seasonal producers, the season for their products is slipping away. Now, there is no possibility of distribution of such goods and it is yet to be decided whether the raw materials will be useful for the next year or not.\\nLockdown is not just a problem, it can also be taken as a possibility. We have fallen behind in many sectors, especially in terms of infrastructure and transportation. If the government is to invest in such sectors, it will create job opportunities and will develop our infrastructure as well. We must identify the sectors we might become independent in. Investment in agriculture, medicine, education and health will improve people’s livelihood. Currently, we are only discussing about the lockdown, however, we are not sure how we are going to move ahead with the treatment should the people start to become sick. How many ventilators do we have? It is essential that we work toward outlining how we are going to establish good health centers and develop infrastructure to support it. This will not only increase local health quality but also cut expenditure. It also provides local employment and adds toward developing people’s livelihood.\\nMisconception about banks and other financial institutions \\nThere is a misconception about banks and financial institutions among the general public as well as various policy makers, which surfaces from time to time. Currently, the government and industries have been pointing that the banks have been accumulating huge profits that should be curbed and managed. It is important to understand that banks and other financial institutions are also companies and firms. The concept of profit and loss is defined according to the business. Banks have been accumulating huge deposits and providing loans accordingly. This is equally risky and has equal investment from the shareholders. Banks have been operating billions of rupees of the people’s deposits and the shareholder’s capital. Every bank has an average capital of 12/13 billions. This also needs to be returned.\\nIn a huge risk to them, these financial institutions have been investing the depositors' money. Banks have the responsibility of keeping the money safe and return it back to them with interest. Considering interest and other expenditure, it is important to understand that the banks only earn a small margin of profit. The Nepal Rastra Bank has stated that the banks cannot increase the interest spread by more than 4.5 percent. Many businesses believe that the problem will be solved by decreasing the interest rate. That is, however, not a valid argument. Everyone has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. But it is not right to give equal relief to everyone. Every business should be studied and relevant standard for relief should be outlined.\\nThe pandemic has narrowed down our economy. The government should focus on how it can improve infrastructure and decrease the expenditure of the banks by taking foreign loans.\\xa0 In doing so, the banks will also be ready to help. We must not be accusatory, we must instead develop a complementary mindset. In doing so, the government can generate revenue which can be helpful to run the state affairs. It is not only the government and the businesses that need to spend, the expenditure of banks is also very big. In such a hard time, we must move ahead with the spirit of camaraderie and not of hatred. In the coming days, it is important to discuss which sector might flourish. Banks arguing about not getting discounts and businesses arguing about not getting favors is ruining the environment and this is a completely disruptive mindset.\\nThe act of pitting banks, business and the policy makers against each other should not be done. Those who have taken loans are protesting about the interest rates. Banks are also unable to provide relief. Therefore, it is essential, in the coming days, to not point fingers at each other and rather work together.\\nDecreasing interest rate\\nCurrently, the Nepal Rastra Bank has ordered to reduce business loans flat by 2 percent. It is necessary to study about what sort of effects COVID-19 has had on businesses. How can the banks give two-percent discount on the interest rate for loans? If the banks’ ‘cost of fund’ will not be less, how can they give it? The central bank has asked to provide a two-percent discount now, it might next ask to provide a four-percent or even six-percent discount. How will the banks provide that? How will the banks earn it? Banks don’t have money themselves. Their return on equity is not high. For example, coronavirus may have affected 99.99 people out of 100, but it most certainly has not affected every person in a similar fashion. It is necessary to study the businesses’ balance sheet and provide relief accordingly. Currently, the government has provided a two-percent discount on interest. Will it suffice for every business? The government should provide relief according to the nature of the problem. How can we come out of such a problematic situation? Everyday, new situations keep arising. The government should change and activate its plans according to the situation of the global economy. Our plans will certainly fail if we move in with one size fits all approach. Situational resolution, therefore, is necessary.\\nProblems in management\\nThere is some contention between the manager and the management in relation to the topic of interest. The governing body has stated the roles and rights of the manager as well as the management. But every organization has its own style of management. In the place where I am working, there is no contention between the manager and the management. Banks and financial institutions are managed by the management. In recent times, the contention created by the rule of lowering of the interest rate has created some friction between the manager and the management, which is really sad. It is important to maintain the trust people have on banks and financial institutions. This should be further solidified. It is necessary to talk in a responsible manner when dealing with sensitive issues. It is important that everyone should rise above their self-interest, and move forward.\\nCoronavirus has taken the world aback. Banks and financial institutions are no exception. It is important that the banks should support people in their decision to reduce their financial spending in the commercial sector. In times of crisis, banks and financial institutions have helped others and operated successfully. They will always move on. But it is important to change with time. Those who successfully capture timely opportunities move forward as leaders. It is not that banks and financial institutions have not faced troubles in the past. It depends on how they operate. If the banks move forward, hand-in-hand with the people, whilst systematizing the rules, they will certainly move past this situation.\\nNo alternative to cutting expense\\nAccording to the quarterly reports, banks have shown lower income but the expenses remain the same. It is apparent that the banks have to move ahead with time and have to prioritize technology. The governing body has orderedthe \\xa0banks to open many counters and to develop infrastructure accordingly. It is necessary to change in that aspect. Internalizing the new and emerging technology can help protect banks. Mobile and tablet banking can be used to provide in-home services. This can result in minimizing the cost and amount of manpower being utilized.\\nIn the coming days, banks have to prioritize technological advancements instead of old practices and the governing body should make it legally acceptable. If we look at neighboring India, one can easily open a bank account with their aadhar card. We also have a system of mandating accounts with citizenships, but the authenticity of that is also questionable. Therefore, to push the bank toward modernism, the government should develop infrastructure to support it, with which, banks and other financial institutions should be able to provide exceptional services and the customers should also be able to avail that from their home. Banks and financial institutions should not just be seen as a place for employment. The rising work-force is increasing expenses. Development and utilization of technology, therefore, is important to re-task such human resources to other production sectors.\\nImportance of a dynamic relief package\\nAs of now, India, and many other countries, have brought big relief packages to kickstart their economy. Currently, it is important for us to develop a dynamic relief package rather than a concrete package. Bringing in one size fits all relief package may not be useful.\\nTherefore, relief packages must be relevant and the government should not be stingy whilst bringing it. The package being distributed by the government goes back in terms of tax. \\xa0Citizens and businesses cannot utilize it. As of yet, businesses have been running at a high risk. However, the revenue being generated by the businesses is being utilized for infrastructure development and national operations. An individual may not need relief, businesses need it. The government should consider its relief toward the business not as reliefs but as investment. If the government is able to invest in time and rejuvenate day-to-day activities, revenue will start increasing and will pave the way for infrastructure development. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli's vision of 'Prosperous Nepal, Happy Nepalis, can be realized by this process.\\n(The author is chairman of Siddhartha Bank)\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nOur economic growth and development activities will be pushed back by at least a year or more due to this COVID-19 pandemic. The market is mostly shut, institutions are closed, and daily economic activities have gone down sharply. The tourism industry is another sector that is severely impacted by the ongoing situation. Despite gloomy circumstances, the situation could be taken as an opportunity to promote agriculture if handled properly. This crisis has taught people how important agriculture is, and could be a great opportunity for Nepal to promote agriculture for sustainable development. There is an increasing interest among youths working abroad to return to their country and get involved in agribusiness. Therefore, if the government could bring attractive policies regarding agriculture it could tempt youths to stay in Nepal and engage in agriculture This will not only boost our economy but would also keep the young labor force in the country.\\nAbout 66% of people are dependent on agriculture which contributes roughly 33% to the country’s GDP (The World Bank). Apart from agriculture, remittance remain the backbone of the country's economy, with Nepalis abroad sending home cash around 30% of the country's GDP. Nepal is the 19thmost remittance dependent country in the world (The World Bank, 2019) Due to this pandemic, many of these workers have lost their jobs and want to return to Nepal. This could mean an increasing number of people getting involved in agriculture. Hence, an improvement in technology and improvement in our agricultural system could see a huge boost in production and our overall economy.\\nThe current situation demands a boost in agriculture for a healthy and prosperous economy. First of all, our conservative thinking regarding agriculture needs to change. In society, those who are involved in farming are still regarded as lower class, uneducated, and a failure. Nepal was once an exporter of several agricultural products. Now it imports food grains worth billions every year due to change in food habits and lifestyle.\\nAgriculture in Nepal could be made more attractive and profitable with some improvements. For example, cash crops like tea, coffee, jute, sugarcane, and some medicinal herbs can be exported to countries with high demand in the external market. Researches should be done regarding how we could increase productivity, and there should be special schemes and subsidies to the farmers from the government. For example, legalizing and commercializing marijuana could do wonders as it has a big demand in countries like the USA. Proper research could lower the production cost, which, in turn, would attract more youths toward entrepreneurship and commercial agriculture. Gaining wisdom from traditional farming and following the path of mechanized agriculture and innovative irrigation facilities could increase both food quality and quantity. The provision of storage houses and processing plants should be established, and priority should be given to domestic products to minimize imports. It not only ensures food security but also uplifts the quality of life of people.\\nNepal still has not fully recovered from the devastating earthquake of 2015 yet. This means we could be seeing the effects of the current pandemic for years and recovering completely from it will take time. There is a high chance of an increase in poverty if we do not take smart decisions to boost agriculture in time. Well-managed agriculture could assist in ensuring a sustainable food system and income-generating opportunity. Also, agriculture is the best way to recover the rural communities from any loss incurred during this pandemic and create greater resilience in countries like Nepal. Our country should take the COVID-19 situation as an opportunity to welcome our youths from abroad and initiate these modern agricultural mechanisms with proper planning and vision.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nLoneliness is not just a sad feeling that we need to get rid of because we want people to be slightly happier. Loneliness is dangerous. People suffering from loneliness are in a constant fight or flight mode. These increased stress levels lead into a number of things but there are some consequences that are more severe than others.\\nSeveral studies have shown that feeling lonely results in a 29% increased risk of heart disease. Feeling lonely also increases the risk of having a stroke by 32%. You might not believe it, but when it comes to heart disease, loneliness is a bigger killer than obesity.\\nAll of us have experienced loneliness at some stage and who knows you are feeling right now reading this article. The youngest and the oldest generations are the loneliest generations. And while most research is focused on seniors; the amount of loneliness in young people is severely underestimated.\\nIt should be no surprise to anyone that lonely children, teenagers and young adults perform worse at school and experience more suicidal thoughts than their socially connected peers. Same is the case with teenagers, adults etc. An employee cannot give a satisfactory output if he/she is victim of loneliness. Let’s be true for a moment that we all have experienced that as it is humanly possible.\\nLoneliness is a pandemic. It does not discriminate on age, gender or borders. It happens all over the world and it happens more frequently to those of us who are already vulnerable. And the worst scenario is that the people who suffer from it does not speak openly and thus fall into the darkness of depression from where it’s not easy to escape. And the eye of the depression doesn’t count whether it’s hazel, amber, black or brown when you are trapped already. Loneliness is often at the root and always a contributor to depression.\\nSo, let’s talk about this known stranger openly breaking all the boundaries we know and put loneliness in its place.\\nLoneliness can be attributed to things such as:\\n\\nThin Family Fabric\\nAge\\n\\n\\nExpectation\\n\\n\\nRejection\\nBad Memories etc\\n\\nNowadays the family texture is wearing ragged. The calming touch of loved ones, family, friends etc has been a characteristic of the Nepali society. But that is in decline. The family touch is much valued in Nepal but unfortunately, it is depleting with time and is a significant reason for distress particularly in old age. Realization of the beauty of our culture is immensely necessary for the new generations or they can witness the value of western family culture in this very COVID-19 pandemic. (I’m not a criticizer of the western civilization).\\nSeeing the current scenario a child flies away for higher education, job etc just a few years after entering teenage. And hence loneliness starts in a parent and is neglected. We all have seen that in our neighbourhoods, in family, friends. Weak family bond causes loneliness among senior people. And it is likely to develop into a serious health issue in the future, if not now. Globally, depression affects 7% of the older population and is predicted to become second leading cause of disability by 2020.\\nSo, is the case with expectations, rejection, bad memory etc. Actually, every point is connected to expectations. You begin to deplete inside, since the day you start germinating expectations. It begins to suck you like parasite from inside and you never know when the days of yours ends.\\nAs Lao Tzu once said: “No expectations mean no disappointments. And, never being disappointed means your spirit never grows old”\\nRejection can be from anyone you love unconsciously. It could be parent, seniors, boss, co-worker, crush, friend, girl/boyfriend, spouse etc. Even your own body sometime rejects the change inside you biologically. It wonders if you chop your own body due to the pain of rejection. But we don’t. Why? We can see and treat what is happening physically but it become hardly incurable when the disease is connected to our emotions, I would say soul.\\nIt is simple you cannot cure the infected, contaminated soul by outside medicines. You have to go inside; you have to transcend yourself into love.\\nWe can cure physical diseases with medicine but the only cure of loneliness, despair and hopelessness is love, Mother Teresa once said.\\nHow to deal with loneliness, what is the solution to this? Let's have some spiritual contemplation.\\nHere I am talking about the love which is fabricated with the fabric of consciousness. But as soon as you hear the word love, your inner experience may give its own definition. You may start to think that the love that did not succeed or happen.\\nThose who have succeeded here, where they are also successful, think a little carefully. Here everyone fails. Those who fail are the ones who succeed, those who succeed also fail. Because the relationships built in ignorance and fainting does not come to fruition. Awaken yourself and the fruit called love will grow enriched in your inner being naturally. To be loved, to love and to become love are different phenomenon. To become love is godliness, the quality, the inbuilt properties what existence provided you. Unfortunately, that godliness is murdered by society on a daily basis. What I want to say is you become love yourself. To love one needs another person, but to love oneself has no meaning for another.\\nLike a flower blooms in solitude, no one sees the flower bloom, the flower blooms in its own pleasure. Flowers are not saddened by the thought that no one came to see them today, no one complimented them, no painter, photographer or journalist came. Nature simply doesn’t care.\\nIf you aren’t in love with yourself, your love for others will be betrayed. It’ll just be acting. It is said that there must be fragrance before there is fragrance. Where there is love, there is forgiveness. The shadow in the back of love moves like a shadow in your back. Not being able to forgive means it was something else. You may be looking for authority or ownership in your alleged love. You made a request and that request disappeared somewhere in the sky. Now you are looking at the sky with a sad heart, it is a proof of your unconsciousness. In fact, the answer never comes.\\nFirst of all, it is important to know that loneliness is the ultimate truth of the world.\\nSome may think that getting married, making girl/boyfriends, shopping, drinking, etc. is the solution to loneliness. But believe me, all these moments are fragile, dependent on each other, the last journey is that of loneliness.\\nI have seen married and unmarried couples, friends being sad, lying to each other. All this is evidence of unconsciousness.\\nPeople like to destroys the things which gives them a trouble. But trouble is not caused by others. Say, if there is anything wrong with your wife, you are free to go to the Himalayas. But the evil is not in the wife but in yourself because even after going to the Himalayas you can find a wife again. The nuisance is inside you. You can't be alone. You need someone who can be your friend. And hence the trouble begins.\\nBut loneliness is natural. And unless you recognize your inner self, you will continue to be weak. Weak ones are self-violent.\\nSo, sing with the whispering wind, identify the present.\\nIt is said that the flower that is to bloom tomorrow has its bud getting ready today.\\nEvery now and then you are creating the future to come. Each moment is being built inside you. You create your own time.\\nSo, live today, if it doesn't feel awakened living in the present, it may not feel tomorrow, it may not feel near in the future. There is no other way to live, there is today and there is life.\\nSo, let’s transform every bad memory in a pleasant one, a new lesson and move forward.\\nBad memories will play the most often, but just because the memory comes up doesn't mean you have to watch it. Change the channel or replace the network if it needs.\\nLet’s watch the loneliness from the mirror of science. But keep this in mind that even with the science you have to be in moment, present and alive. Otherwise there’s a slight difference between magic and tragic.\\nModern science explains that we as humans are fundamentally built to be a part of a group. We are fundamentally built to depend on others and to have others depending on us.\\nSo, if we keep the momentum of science it simply means that there’s nothing cool or brave or great about going through life alone. So, please call the friend that you all have and just be bored together. And then let people in. Because when you lean on others, you are helping them and you are helping yourself.\\nAccording to the study by Holt Lunstand and team, the support of family, friends and neighbors can increase your chance of living to a healthy old age by 50 percent.\\nHence, the decisions are ours, the ceremony to choose is ours, the festival to lighten up our lives is ours, to celebrate the awakening is ours. Choose wisely.\\nSee you in the future, if the existence let me live, if the present allows me to write.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nFriday, May 1. It had been raining all morning—quite unusual for this time of the year.\\nBesides the persistent rain, something unusual was unfolding in MadhyapurThimi, an old town 10 kilometers east of Kathmandu city center.\\nAfter crisscrossing the town, six ambulances with flashing lights and blaring sirens screeched to a stop one after another to the main entrance of Nepal Korea Friendship Municipality Hospital.\\xa0\\nResidents in the vicinity, observing the lockdown restrictions in the homes, started to peek through their windows.\\nThe emergency crews wheeled 17 people to the hospital’s triage station purpose-built for COVID-19 patients.\\nThe municipality hospital had been preparing for this ‘dreadful’ situation for a while. Soon, all the components of the hospital sprang into action and directed the incoming patients in their newly set-up isolation and intensive care (ICU) facilities.\\xa0\\nPatients, showing mild to severe COVID-19 symptoms, were taken to the hospital’s special counselling and sample collection section. And medics took their throat and nasal swab samples.\\nThe hospital had recently built a new molecular facility for COVID-19 detection. All in all, these incoming COVID-19 cases were well taken care of as per the COVID-19 preparedness protocol that the hospital had put together. Fortunately, this was only a preparedness drill.\\nUnder the leadership of the mayor’s office, the hospital conducted the drill in collaboration with the Nepal Red Cross Society and the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal.\\nThe hospital and the municipality were able to identify some important gaps, and lessons learned from the exercise which were incorporated into a polished plan for COVID-19 preparedness.\\n(The author is One Health expert and Executive Director of the Center for Molecular Dynamics Nepal.

       "  '\\nThe last fortnight of the 2076 BS (ending mid-April) was an unexpected misfortune for me and my family. Loss of father is a big tragedy and it befell upon us suddenly. Early in the morning, my 80-year-old ‘Ba’ left his body and this world, without a chance of a formal goodbye.\\nThen, the cultural self-quarantine started. I had to live separately, wear white–loin cloth (kaupin, dhoti and mekhala), cook my own food, wash dishes and clothes, take bath in a separate \\xa0dhunge-dhara (stone spout), sleep on the floor with few radi-pakhis (hand-knitted woolen mats and blankets) and white cover on the bed, head, and all over the body. I was not allowed to touch anyone; everybody would rather run-away from me. A very bitter experience at the time of the irrecoverable loss of the father.\\nBeing a psychiatrist and a mental health student, I had always felt our culture in general, the final rite function in particular, was an indirect method for grief-resolution. Yes, the person who has lost his loved one, near and dear one, will remain in grief. \\xa0As the psychological theory explains, death-grieving process follows certain emotional defense reactions—denial, anger, bargain, depression, and acceptance. The Hindu cultural practices facilitate the ways to overcome these grieving emotions. We say, after a person dies, the soul leaves the body, so the body is not ours now. The body built up of the five elements of the nature—earth, water, fire, air, and ether—has to be released to the atmosphere. So, as soon as a person dies, we hurry in initiating this process, we cremate the body at a river-bank, and release the ashes left over-or remainder, to the river. Hence, all the five elements of the dead body are liberated to their respective destinations.\\nThen, we treat the soul which has gone to the atmosphere as preta; i.e., the floating body-less soul. This floating thing does not have its own body and it cannot touch the ground, and may be a nuisance to the family, if not treated properly. It remains as such in the atmosphere unless its nearest relative (mostly the son) provides some ingredients (water, milk, rice ball-pinda etc.) to prepare its miniature body. Such body-building process is completed in 10 days when the son does the departed soul’s aurdhadaihik kriya. These ten days, the son will be in self-quarantine as devised by the culture, as explained above.\\nYes, the last 15 days of the bygone year (2076), I had to practice those cultural rites for my late father. When the 10th day function is over, the preta gets its miniscule body, and is able to receive our offerings (water and pinda). On the 11th day, we provide food (rice-balls) and other necessary things (bed, clothes, sandals, umbrella, utensils etc.) for the preta for its divine journey. On the 12th day, we do sapindikaran shraddha so that the preta will join its ancestors and extended families in heaven being as a peetri. Now, the departed soul is no more a trouble-making nuisance (preta), rather our respectable peetri, who will bless us for our peace and prosperity. On the 13th day, we do purification ceremony, purifying our body, our home, and we are accepted by other members of our family and society as touchables.\\nYes, these 10-13 days seem to be very troublesome. Being untouched, separated, alone, feels terrifying and stigmatizing indeed. For me, cooking my own food, washing utensils and clothes, eating one meal a day (that too rice and ghee), were extra burdensome, really; as I was never used to these cooking-washing business. But, I feel, it is our culture’s treatment to resolve our grief. The processes of ‘denial, anger, bargain and depression’ will not much effect our mind when we are actively engaged in these processes, and we are able to accept the universal reality of death easily. Our loved ones are not dead; rather they have just changed their clothing, left the old clothes (body) to get the newer ones, as Garuda Purana and Shreemad-Bhagwadgeeta explain. If we do these final rites faithfully and hopefully, the preta becomes peetri, and guides us throughout our life; blesses us and our children with peace, prosperity, and wisdom.\\nMay be these are just our fantasy; based on the hope, faith or belief system, but, I don’t think these are mere superstitions or myths. These death rites will definitely help us overcome our psychological pain and sorrow, and guide us in our journey of life. This will heal our stress-related psychiatric reactions, adjustment issues and protect us from the potential post-traumatic disorders. We know exposure, and releasing, relieving, and revisiting are the only ways to deal with the traumatic-stress associated with the loss (or death in particular). Our culture facilitates these processes. We are exposed to the dead bodies as early as possible, we carry them, worship them and cremate them as soon as possible. Our faith-based theories on rebirth and reincarnation, preta-peetri, are the psychological dogmas that enable us to accept whatever has happened. Our scriptures have well-explained these: death is not an end, birth and death is a cycle, death of anybody who has taken birth is the universal truth.\\nThese two-week self-practice of quarantine will make these beliefs even more strong. Being a mental-health personnel and having self-experienced these practices, I do believe our culture is soothing my pain and sorrow, and have healed my grief, and I am able to fully recover from this anguish. The culture has empowered me to accept the truth as it is.\\nApart from these, the process of self-quarantine as I practiced last month, and as it is being followed in our culture for so long, is very much scientific system, I believe. Quarantine, the term we are getting familiar in the last four to five months following the COVID-19 pandemic, has been culturally advised in our part of the world for time immemorial. Why can’t we see its positive aspect? It might have made us disinfected indirectly. The nearest and the dearest ones of the dead person, who might have died following a grave infection, are ultimately quarantined for two weeks during the process of the aurdhadaihik kriya, making sure that the community transmission is curtailed. What a scientific culture? Isn’t it?\\nAlso the two weeks of self-cooking and washing, for me, might have enabled me to live independently after the loss of the father who had taken care of me till date. Yes, this process will make the child’s independent life easier, as our guru had explained me last month.\\nThus, the two-weeks cultural-quarantine process I was involved last month enhanced my craving to dwell our cultural heritage and religious scriptures more and more. This will definitely help me achieve my goal of bridging spirituality with psychiatry; which I have started actively probing from this New Year (2077).\\n(The author is a psychiatrist with Dhulikhel Hospital-Kathmandu University Hospital)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt is obvious that most people wish to have light skin. When I was small my friends, those innocent kids, who were dark-skinned used to wish for lighter skin on their birthdays. Many dark-skinned people face complications of different forms just because they were born dark. “Kalo Din” as a bad day, “Kalo” person as if somehow, they are less of a human due to their color tells us how we perceive the color black. It is time we redefine the color black.\\nIn the context of Nepal, when the child is born, it is common to find visitors commenting on the color of the baby as part of the compliment--lighter the better of course. When that dark-skinned child starts school, other challenges come along the way. There is where they start getting nicknames like “Kaaley” and “Kaali”. Some may argue these nicknames are a form of love but guess what? It’s mostly not. We never consider that child’s mentality and we kind of make them believe being lighter-skinned somehow means more beautiful and superior. And it seems to apply more on girls than boys.\\nAs time passes by that dark child and even her friends, are socialized and groomed up in such a way with a concept that being black is not beautiful. No matter at school or home or even at relatives’ house, her skin color becomes a topic of discussion time and again. Her skin color is mentioned several times intentionally or unintentionally which she doesn’t want to hear more. This also massively affects confidence and shatters their self-esteem.\\nThere comes a time when that dark girl enters her teenage. For dark-skinned girls in our community, this phase is one of the toughest ones. The girl stands in front of the mirror wishing her skin was lighter. She compares her skin with her lighter friends and tries to build that much-needed confidence. Probably the only satisfaction she gets is when she knows she is going to be around someone even darker. She then tries multiple makeup products, starts believing whatever ideas she hears and reads to look lighter. She realizes the real life does not come with a photo editor app. Some girls are even forced to give up on their dreams just because of their skin color. She is constantly hit with a feeling of less respect and different dimension of judgment just because of her skin color.\\n\\xa0\\nOur mind is programmed such that we think black means less attractive or even a “jinx” at times. We don’t even bother thinking black is just another color and it could resemble something beautiful and powerful. Perhaps we need to remind ourselves the very first learning at school happened on a blackboard. We love wearing black suits to look smart and bold. In the Maasai tribes of Kenya and Tanzania, the color black is associated with rain clouds, becoming a symbol of life and prosperity. But here we are guided by certain philosophies where black symbolizes negativities like the \"blacklist\", \"black market\", \"black flag\", \"black magic\" et cetera. We know black is just a color, however, we have set our mindset to think to be fair is beautiful and being dark isn’t. We have heard stories of dark-skinned bleaching their skin, putting tons of make-up only to be accepted in the group.\\nEvery color has its importance and meaning. For example, red symbolizes love. We do not know who defined the symbols of all these colors but just because someone had a specific idea at some point in history does not mean we cannot evolve for better. We could reduce so much hate and social problems if we could treat every color equally. If we redefine black as “bold and beautiful” probably the next generation with dark skin would be proud of their instinct and fulfill their potential with high self-esteem. Who knows, there might come a time in the future where makeup products will be widely sold to make skin darker instead?\\nEveryone deserves the crown of their beauty and uniqueness. You are beautiful regardless of your skin color. There will also be toxic people in society, so people with dark skin should remember that they are not here to improve everyone- that’s not practical anyway. We hardly hear about anyone with dark skin winning international beauty pageants. Some dark-skinned do win the pageants but they are few and far between. But 2019 was different as black women won both the Miss World and Miss Universe titles with Toni-Ann Singh of Jamaica crowned Miss World and Zozibini Tunzi Miss Universe.\\nTunzi grew up in a society where dark-skinned wasn’t deemed beautiful but knew she could be a role model. After winning the Miss Universe competition, she now wants to see black children do not feel inferior because of their skin color. It is time we all accepted what we have and what we are provided by mother nature. Beauty is just not having lighter skin, it comes in different flavors and shades. There may come a day when the future generation may accept black as the color of boldness, comfort, strength, beauty, and protection if we start changing our mindset today. Beauty lies in the eyes of beholders. We need to renovate our perceptions of beauty leaving behind all the stereotypical thoughts regarding color black.\\nToday there are many famous and successful doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, leaders, singers, players, movie stars in the world who are successful despite being black. Neither all are black, nor all are white. No matter what their skin colors are, they have made their journeys possible due to their inner potential, hard work and dedication. When we are confident and be bold enough to stand out in the crowd, we can change the perception. So, it’s time to shine not to hide your inner potential and the shade of your skin color.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFlatten the curve via lockdown; then what? As long as the health infrastructure does not see an unprecedented scale of enhancement, then we’re pretty much shifting the burden of COVID-19 to the future. The burden comes in (at least) two ways – public health (assuming the virus is as lethal as many are believing) and economy.\\nWe could argue that one of the biggest reasons Nepal has not seen a surge of COVID-19 cases is the lockdown. But there are fundamental problems with lockdown.\\nFirst, it does not get rid of the virus itself.\\nSecond, it invariably delays the immunity which is, as it stands today, our best hope against the virus. We know that people in the labs are putting in their best efforts to come up with a vaccine; but we also know that putting in best efforts does not necessarily yield the desired outcome. We never had vaccines for HIV or MERS. I suppose we do not think that back then the people in the labs took their mission to develop a vaccine any less seriously than they are doing now. Now even if we do get one, let’s buy the World Health Organization’s words and say it arrives in 18 months. Are we, then, prepared to impose this lockdown for 18 months? How will we sustain everything else for those 18 months? If you shut the economy, what are we placing our bet on, to save us all? Still, that is being optimistic. Let’s say it takes five years. Do we go for five years then? There is no difference between a five-week lockdown and a five-year in principle. Or, what if it never comes about?\\nThird, if we act rationally and slowly and incrementally open the economy after, say, seven weeks, then we’re going to start catching the virus again. In other words, the whole lockdown will have been in vain from public health perspective; and from economic point of view, an intervention of criminal proportions.\\nWe are missing the mark on many things in the meantime. We do not know if the strains that are prevalent in China, Europe, US and the rest of Asia and the ones that are here in Nepal are the same ones. We know now that they are different in Europe and the US. Have we been studying that in the meantime? This is a research that should have been happening parallelly in Nepal.\\nFurthermore, we are ignoring what the data suggests. If we look at the data, it is telling us that the old and ones with pre-existing conditions are more at risk. A Stanford study has found that 99.2% of fatal cases had underlying illness. Now we can all agree that the reason you go for a lockdown is to contain the transmission rather than kill the virus. A rational approach then would be to identify the ones that are most susceptible, and then take necessary measure to ensure that they are not coming in contact with other potential hosts so long that they are not already affected. We haven’t been doing this either.\\nWe also know that the young and healthy are less susceptible. Of course, this does not mean that they will not catch the virus; but this notion of risk should not mean that the state imposes a ban on earning a livelihood. To put that in perspective, let’s take the number of motorcycles that are in the zone of Bagmati. It is over a million. That effectively means that every day, over a million people put their lives at risk by simply choosing the take a bike-ride for whatever reason. But we do not ban motorcycles despite knowing that the risk is real. And that is because we know that that proposition of banning motorcycles is not rational. One cannot overstress the fact that everything else that hurts and kills, also exists alongside the virus and we cannot unsee them. In fact, we now know that those (young and old alike) who were tested positive for COVID-19 in Nepal did not exhibit severe symptoms and our hospitals could easily treat them. There is, therefore, no science or rationality behind this extension of lockdown; just a fear. And only a more painful future awaits us.\\nAnd now this,\\nThere is reason to believe now that the virus may have been in circulation as early as September, 2019. By the end of December, China “alerted” the WHO. January 24, first case confirmed in Nepal. In the midst of this head start, Nepal chose to rather continue to witness and promote the Visit Nepal Year, 2020; even self-proclaiming to be a COVID-19-free country. On March 23, a nation-wide lockdown is announced to go into effect from 6 am of the 24th. Now, why do you go from a “COVID-19-free” country to a nation-wide lockdown in a snap, despite having only one active case of virus, and after having practically squandered the head start? The answer is, to exhibit something (anything) that resembles decisiveness in part of the government that much of the people were already expecting by this point; and equally importantly, to display political power. In other words, popularity and authority, the two dearest factors for a political leader are what led to the nationwide lockdown in Nepal. Concern for public health played little role, if any.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n(The author is a researcher at Samriddhi Foundation, and can be reached at akash@samriddhi.org )\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nLam and I were at the Hamad International Airport in Doha on March 17. It was our last exchange before Lam would catch his flight at 2:30 am or so to Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and I would go back home to Kathmandu. We’d blamed coronavirus for the situation we were in, for the emotional rollercoaster that we’d experienced—not knowing the ride really hadn’t even begun. While we were in quarantine, Lam tested positive for COVID-19. This was a big reality check for both of us and many of our friends. Something we had only seen in memes and farewell letters had snuck its way into our reality. Two days later I too tested positive for COVID-19.\\xa0\\nNepal only had one case of coronavirus prior to mine which was of a student who had already recovered. Therefore on paper, my country maintained a 100% recovery rate. Due to this, many citizens took pride in the fact that Nepal did not have any other cases. Many beliefs went around on why we had been spared by COVID-19, reinforcing a form of national pride rooted in conspiracies. Under these circumstances, I was the second ever and the only active case in Nepal. My case, therefore, had no previous protocol to follow and not many knew how to approach my situation.\\xa0\\nMy family was notified of my test report at 10:00 pm. Despite my sister repeatedly telling me that I had tested positive I refused to believe it. I had shown no symptoms until that day. Retrospectively thinking, between the time I got tested and the report was released, I had convinced myself that I had been over-thinking. I had found some comfort in denying that I had the virus and denying the possibility that I may have infected anyone with it. The thought that I may have infected people on the way or my own family remained my biggest concern after coming to terms with my situation for the rest of the days that followed. After all, the doctor had specified that I had a large virus count, which meant I was extremely contagious at that point. Amidst my thoughts of concern and anxiety, an ambulance was headed toward my house to pick me up immediately to place me into the isolation ward at the Teku Hospital.\\xa0\\nThe symptoms started on the very first night at the hospital, where I was admitted on the 22nd of March. I had massive stomach pains and the accompanying shortness of breath meant I was not able to sleep the whole night. You know how when you pay attention to your breathing and it starts feeling more and more abnormal every time you inhale? It was like that for several days. My chest forbade me from taking deep breaths. I no longer was control of my body and the virus was.\\nGetting out of the bed had to be done with effort, eating had to be done by force and insomnia prevailed. I distinctly remember a night when after reading about lack of smell being a COVID-19 symptom, I tried to smell a bar of soap. Surprise, surprise I couldn’t! Talking about symptoms. I also had minor dry cough, while I did not have a fever at any time. Nonetheless, it is important to note that my case was mild. My heart goes out to those who have had to experience this virus, many who have had it much worse than me.\\xa0\\nThroughout all of this, the media played a big role in my circumstances. I knew I would have to bear the consequences of everyone coming to know that “a 19-year-old girl, a student who had travelled from France via Doha on the 17th of March” had tested positive.\\nKathmandu is a small city. To those who knew me, these details automatically struck my name. Although the media kept my name anonymous -and I’m not exaggerating when I say this—almost every outlet I knew, had quickly written an article about me with the above-mentioned details and many more. Some that were true, but many outright false. Lam had become my female roommate in Paris. I had apparently met with many relatives before I got tested. My parents were made into doctors. A particularly striking article was the following: Republica, an English daily that publishes The New York Times in Nepal, had labeled me a ‘super-spreader’ out of speculation. They didn’t know my story, they didn’t have any evidence of me spreading the virus. But to many people, that was who I had become—a SUPER-SPREADER.\\xa0\\nThe 23rd of March was something else. Somehow, somewhere, someone else had decided the narrative to my story. They had changed up my facts to fit theirs. I became subject and subjected to the stigmatization that surrounded coronavirus in my country. Social media was exploding. People were blaming me, people hated me, and many even went as far as to give me death threats, suggesting that they rather have me shot dead than alive.\\nThe negative comments got to a point where my doctors would often call requesting me not to check the news. I had proof of my self-quarantine and I had proof of how careful I had been, yet I did not have a voice. My anonymity was necessary to assure my physical safety. Even amongst my own social media circles, I saw many who posted about my case (not knowing the patient was me), oftentimes with negative connotations. Stories with facepalms and sighs! Nevertheless, I understand that they may have been misinformed and did not have the intention to hurt the patient, to hurt me.\\xa0\\nThat day, the Health Ministry went on to call a press conference specifically to discuss my case followed by a lockdown. I sat on my bed wondering how I had gone from self-quarantining in my room to causing my entire nation to go into lockdown. Yes, I was in many ways responsible for my government's decision to go into a nationwide lockdown. At that moment I wish I had reminded myself that it could have been anyone else in my shoes. But the reality still was that it had been me. It was overwhelming and this story was one for the books.\\xa0\\nAmongst all the chaos, I was, am and will always be extremely grateful to my nurses for keeping my spirits up. On the 24th of March, the nurse on duty had called me simply to say she wanted to convey the message that one of her Facebook friends was praying for me along with their entire village. Upon knowing that the nurse worked in the hospital where I was admitted, the man had requested her to let me know of this. These little gestures massively raised my spirits throughout for the next three weeks. The nurses called me every now and then until the end to simply check up on how I was, even during times when it wasn’t necessary. My doctors too have shown immense kindness toward me, constantly ensuring me that everything will be ok.\\nIf you have made it thus far thank you for making an effort into understanding my situation from my perspective today. I have recovered from all of my symptoms and after a month of landing in Nepal, have finally tested negative. The majority of the people who were on my flight have been contact-traced and none were found to be infected by me. Everyone in my household also tested negative to the virus, due to the cautious decision to self-quarantine. Lam too has fully recovered and is in good health.\\nI am aware that many things have been left unsaid in this article: whether the hospital had adequate preparations, what communications between me and my doctors look like, or what kinds of medicines were provided to me. Neither have I talked about the measures I took in self-quarantine and my recovery process. However, I am always free to talk about any of these things and may write about many of these aspects in the future.\\nFinally, today my mental and physical health remains intact, due to support from my family, my doctors, my nurses and my friends. To those who have been aware of my situation and continuously supported me, I am largely grateful to you and everything you have done for me in the past three weeks.\\nOne thing I have grown to realize in this process is that oftentimes we disregard the mental health part of the virus. Symptoms like shortness of breath can largely exacerbate one’s anxiety as well as the ignorance the public may show toward them. COVID-19 is not something to stigmatize and could happen to anyone and at any given point of time. This is something we all have to understand. To anyone else who may find themselves in a similar situation to mine, I remain at their disposal should they wish to talk about it or have any questions and I wish them a speedy recovery.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nI have tried to summarize the information I could find in the Nepale media and government press briefings about the nine positive cases in Nepal in this timeline. Except for Case 1, other cases are still recorded as “active cases”.\\xa0\\xa0 The text below explains what is shown in the chart.\\nExcept for Case No. 9, all were imported cases, and I have tried to document (wherever possible), when (and how) the person arrived in Nepal. I have also added information on how (if available) they traveled to their home districts.\\xa0\\nWe need to note that the date the positive cases were announced are not the days they were infected.\\xa0 The person must have been infected days before they arrived in Nepal (or during their travels).\\nUntil all the international flights were closed on March 22, there were many flights coming in every day from China and other countries. Kantipur(7 April) reported arrival of 20,054 people from 65 countries during the 10 days (14-23 Mar) before the closure of the airport.\\xa0 Among them 19,553 were Nepalis.\\nTens of thousands came across the land before the closure of the border with India.\\xa0 I may add here that just between April 2-6 positive cases in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarkhand increased from 120 to 339 (183%). So, the week(s) before this, when the Nepalis started returning, the virus must have already taken hold in this region.\\nThe infected persons further took taxi, bus, microbus, and also traveled by air (e.g. Buddha Air, Yeti Air).\\xa0 They stayed with relatives in Kathmandu or in hotels, and one even had a dinner party booking two rooms in a hotel.\\xa0\\nThe bottom line is that during all this time, the persons with positive had come in contact with numerous persons.\\xa0 In addition, the 175 students (who returned from Wuhan) plus 64 passengers who came from affected countries (on March 21) were all negative.\\nHow fortunate that no one else has been infected!\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nThe COVID-19 crisis, which has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), has infected more than 1.3 million people and killed around 75,000 while over 250,000 people have recovered.\\nNepal has reported nine cases, with one cured and eight positive at the time of writing this. There has been no officially reported death from COVID-19 in Nepal until now. While this is not a very bad news at the moment there are certainly things to worry about. There is also concern about under-diagnosis which may have resulted in lower number of cases.\\nThis article will focus on the overall efforts being made and additional measures that would help to deal with the crisis.\\nOverall security and safety of health workers and frontline workers:\\nThe government should focus on boosting the morale of health workers. Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and encouraging words from leaders, mainly the prime minister or his deputy, and health minister are important. Guidelines regarding PPE is developed by the WHO and also approved by Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP). PPE is needed for following reasons:\\n\\nto motivate health workers, ambulance drivers and security persons or people working on the front line.\\nto reduce number of infections as we need to protect the health workers from getting infected in the first place. They will also be carriers if not provided adequate PPEs.\\nto protect health workers on the frontline who are waging the battle against COVID-19, whom we cannot afford to lose.\\nto protect other security persons from getting infected.\\n\\nBesides, government should provide quarantine facilities for the health workers and take care of their safety and security.\\nCivic engagement: \\nThe government has imposed lockdown and asked people to stay home unless for urgent reasons or emergency services. The people are helping the enforcement by staying home as much as possible. The government has also asked for donations for relief funds. It should seek to mobilize civil society to deal with current crisis.\\n\\xa0Garner the support from I/NGOs: \\nIt is imperative for the government to engage NGOs and INGOS and seek their support and mobilize possible resources, including available expertise and human resources. The government should tap on their resources and connections by mobilizing them.\\nInvolvement of private medical colleges and hospitals: \\nThe government should provide PPEs to the private medical colleges and big private hospitals and engage them to deal with this crisis. The medical colleges have large infrastructure and equipment as well as a large number of trained human resources, health workers, specialists, etc. We will need their full support to deal with this crisis.\\nRaising awareness: \\nWe need to adopt and put all preventive measures in place and take precautions, but not panic. We don't want to see more people with mental health problems related to COVID-19. Besides, the social media and anti-virus campaign should focus on stigma and discrimination issues beyond hand washing, social distancing and so on. We should not let anyone be stigmatized, harassed or discriminated because of the COVID-19 infection.\\nThe government need to take extra measures beside those already been taken:\\nCoordination among different levels of government\\nThere needs to be a clear coordination at all three levels of government and allocation of roles and responsibilities. There is a need for better management of quarantine centers along with the basic services as envisioned in the guidelines by Ministry of Health and Population. There is a clear need of security forces to provide security at those centers.\\nLockdown and overall government response: \\nThe government has extended the nationwide lockdown until the next week. In the meantime, lockdown is no panacea in itself. This is where we expect further work from the government in for preparations to prevent, contain and mitigate the impact of COVID-19 We need to implement/adopt it as per our local context and culture. Farmers should continue with agriculture.\\nTesting Increase:\\nThe most important thing is testing which the WHO has marked as the best strategy to contain this pandemic. It is where we are lacking the most. So far only over 1,400 tests have been done. The government has brought test kits and some PCR machines and is increasing sites where the test can be done which will certainly help increase the number of tests in the coming days. Sample collection and delivery up to the center should be done properly.\\nContact tracing: \\nAnother is contact tracing and testing people coming from abroad and putting them in either home quarantine or in quarantine facilities which are arranged by the government. The collection of data is very essential. Mobile teams of health workers, female community health volunteers (FCHVs) and security persons need to be mobilized for contact tracing, sample collection and enforcing quarantine as necessary. While this is already being done it needs to be stepped up.\\n\\xa0\\nRelief package and financial stimulus plan:\\nThe people are not only cooperating with the government but are also paying the prices. The businesses are closed and the people are forced to stay home and so on. The relief package brought by the government seems too little too late and there is no stimulus plan for the business sector and migrant workers who returned from abroad but whose contribution in the form of remittance is the backbone of our national economy.\\nLogistics supply:\\nThe emergency purchase and provision of adequate ventilators, ICU set ups, and emergency medicines and other equipment supplies should be ensured. There are chances for shortage of oxygen supply as well. Hence, procuring as many oxygen concentrators as possible could be helpful. The various organizations should coordinate with the MOHP to identify the needs and help procure necessary equipment and supplies.\\nMigrant workers returning from India: \\nThere have been news reports that people have been forced to stay on river banks for days and nights because they cannot enter Nepal because the borders are closed. The Nepalis who have reached the border points should be let in and immediately put in mandatory quarantine for 14 days.\\nNepali diaspora/ Nepalis living abroad: \\nThe government should further use embassies and missions abroad to take stock of the Nepalis living abroad. The migrant workers and students abroad who are worst hit by this crisis need to feel that government is coordinating with various governments regarding their safety, security and treatment.\\nPM Relief Fund:\\nThe government has appealed for donations in PM relief fund. Many companies and corporate houses and business organizations have contributed. There is also a policy that requires medium and large scale enterprises to spend one percent of their net profit on corporate social responsibility. However, the money is spent by the corporates themselves and meaningful works are not done most of the times. The money needs to be channelized and spent in the government identified priority areas or go to the PM relief fund directly.\\n(Dr. Koirala is involved in infectious diseases and public health works.

       "  \"\\nHours of flying in the air staring at clouds from the window seat. Hours of train journeys watching hustle and bustle of stations. Hours of road trips living my favorite songs in imagination. I have cherished these moments alone all my life. Yes, I am a lone wolf and I have been living an emotionally isolated yet self-contained life.\\xa0\\nSo, am I a shiftless or indolent person? Certainly not. I started my career at a young age and have been working happily for more than fifteen years. But I have been into introversion since the time I remember. All these years, I spoke way less when I was with people. I made fewer friends. I shared feelings lesser than I wanted to. I didn’t share my opinion until I was asked to. People often thought I am an egoistic person. Some punched this feedback straight on my face.\\xa0\\nWhile I was cutting myself off from people all these years, I grew up with a habit that many found a strange one.\\xa0\\nThe practice of talking to self. Conversing with self every day helped me know myself better, understand myself better. My vision for my ambitions got clearer. Most importantly I infused my soul with the ability of self-healing. I started knowing whom to reach out first when something did not go well. Self companionship turned out to be the best gift I offered myself.\\xa0\\nSelf-isolation doesn’t just mean we physically trap ourselves behind the walls and do not see anything outside. The experience of isolation is a mental state. Isolation, in fact, is a response to the external world. It is a state where the mind remains unaffected by what’s happening around. Up to a large extent.\\nNew York based professor Matthew Bowker who researched solitude has stated that - it’s a deeper internal process that strengthens your relationship with yourself. You can stay isolated even when surrounded by people. This fit into my belief system years back.\\nI lived almost 10 years of my active life alone. All these years, the only person I spent most of the time with was myself. Because I wanted to be that way. Sitting all day in solitude never got me bored.\\xa0\\nI read. I wrote. I meditated. I cooked. I did dishes. I cleaned up. I danced. I sang. All in front of myself. I didn’t have to leave anything. I didn’t have to distance from others while getting closer to myself. Self companionship is what always soothed and healed my heart.\\xa0\\nI lived willingly alone. I would wait for office hours to end not to get rid of works, but to run toward my apartment to cherish solitude. I would want nights to be longer not to sleep more, but to be around myself more. I would wait for Saturdays and Sundays to relish 'alonement' my way.\\xa0\\nI loved it more than anyone when UK-based writer Francesca Specter introduced the word alonement in one of her articles saying she finds alonement so enticing. She defines alonement as the state when a person is not lonely. A few criticized her saying she is too young to talk about the merits of being alone as she hasn’t seen its adverse effects. But there were a lot many who praised the concept.\\nIn one of his interviews, American Buddhist monk Reggie Ray has said, the power of solitude lets a person closer to her/himself and their life and to the people around them. That means a person who practices self-isolation or solitude is more compassionate to others.\\xa0\\nI remember, two years back when I broke my phone’s screen into pieces, I wanted to have an experiment. My Samsung had hit the floor hard and stopped working due to screen damage. I purposely decided not to get a new phone for a few days. Those four days I lived with a non-smartphone just for needful calls, clock and alarm purposes. I would be in the office during daytime and morning/evening would be a no-scrolling time. Due to the nature of my work and the designation I held, I had to get a new phone that supports the internet otherwise I would extend those four days to 40. It felt so quiet without social media and the internet at least for few hours a day.\\xa0\\nLiving an emotionally isolated life is a mindful and sane decision that shaped me as a spiritual person.\\xa0\\nWhile so much is going on in our world right now, I am witnessing stay-home-order days as just a few of the usual days in life. And I have been wondering how perfectly each of Blaise Pascal’s words, said in the 17th century, is making sense today: “All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.”\\n(To read more from the author go to\\xa0www.leenachitwan.com)\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nMisinformation and disinformation around COVID-19 do more harm than the coronavirus itself as it restricts one from getting accurate information about health care and disease prevention. It has increased targeted online hate speech toward individuals who are infected by the virus in Nepal and those at possible risk of infection further putting them at the risk of physical violence. This has created unnecessary trouble and fear in their lives. There has also been increase in racial discrimination and pseudo-nationalism around the world. Digital rights activists are already expressing concerns about the risk of mass surveillance of people by the state and non-state actors giving the excuse of pandemic.\\nCorona pandemic has been directly affecting the way we interact with one another in real life and online and has changed our behavior. The information related to the virus and pandemic we receive everyday is almost overwhelming with outpouring of news and updates from around the world. There are enough conspiracy theories about the virus and misinformation about how it could spread, prevented and cured. Much of the misinformation is based on our cultural and religious beliefs and being spread in the form of images, memes, short videos, texts, reporting, statements, blog posts, etc.\\nSocial media platforms have provided people with autonomy to be able to produce media content instead of just being a consumer, as opposed to other media like TV, radio or print media and given multiple source of information on any subject matter. It has proven to be one of the most powerful tools in the digital age for mass mobilization and social change. However, during crisis like this, social media platforms are also used to spread misinformation and disinformation. And specially if the content feeds to emotions, they travel really fast with no fact-checking. In stress and confusion, the validity of the source is often\\xa0 not checked before people share it further. COVID-19 is also being called the “first social media pandemic” and the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling it an “infodemic” given the widespread misinformation and disinformation around it.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat are harms and risks of misinformation and disinformation?\\n\\nRestricts one from getting accurate information\\n\\nMisinformation and disinformation are directly linked to people getting inaccurate information about their health care and disease prevention and puts them at greater risk which is against the right to health and right to information of individuals, as guaranteed by the Constitution of Nepal as well as international treaties Nepal has been signatory to. This also shadows the factual information from verified sources which are specially important given the nature of contradiction of coronavirus. As digital literacy among Nepali citizen is only 31% (2019), the lack of awareness on filtering and fact-checking, the lack of accurate information can create an environment of panic and anxiety.\\n\\nTargeted harassment and trolling\\n\\nThere are many conspiracy theories as to how coronavirus spreads leading to targeted harassment toward certain communities and nationalities in real life and online. In the\\xa0 social media, we can see hate speech against the people who left Kathmandu after announcement of the lockdown, mostly because of the classism in Nepal society fueled by disinformation about them. There has been sharing of mal-information as well, where several list of passengers from different flight that flew to Nepal were leaked with personal details of individuals which led to online abuse toward the individuals in the list. Among them, a 19-year-old girl who had a travel history to France was slut-shamed and threatened of rape.\\n\\nCurtailment of freedom of expression\\n\\nThe terminologies around misinformation and disinformation are often used without understanding the effect it could have. Often “fake news”\\xa0 is used by media and publication, which is inadequate and has no clear meaning to describe the complex phenomena of mis-and dis-information. It has also been used to justify censorship laws and curtail freedom of expression and press freedom. Malaysia is an example where it passed anti-fake news law before the election in 2018. Nepal government has been hostile toward freedom of expression in the past years, be it be through the infamous Information technology bill or monitoring social media activities of journalists. So we can only hope another repressive law is not introduced in the name of ‘managing misinformation and disinformation’. There has already been an arrest of a Nepali citizen for producing and sharing of an audio clip related to COVID-19 case in Nepal. It is the government\\'s responsibility toward to provide the citizens with reliable information and data through their websites and press releases so that people could follow those accurate information, instead of just putting those who spread \"fake news\" behind the bar.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSurveillance from the state and non-state actors\\n\\nTracking of individuals who are infected by the virus and are at possible risk for public good is necessary but it depends on how it is being done. The collected information of people who are infected and who are at possible risk should be used responsibly taking into account the right to privacy of these individuals. The information and data that are collected are to be stored safely and used ethically. Given the lack of data protection law and mechanism in our country this is something unlikely to happen. Corona pandemic should not be an excuse for mass surveillance by the state or non-state actors including privacy companies, social media platforms, etc.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSpread of rumors\\n\\nRumors in relation to the pandemic created artificial scarcity in the market and panic-buying was visible even in Kathmandu. People who could afford bought enough supplies including cooking gas. This puts the underprivileged under further disadvantage. Groups with an intent to spread disinformation might use opportunities such as the pandemic to spread hatred toward certain communities and further spread misinformation related to the pandemic.\\n\\xa0\\nWhat can you do as an individual to counter misinformation and disinformation?\\n\\nBefore you share any content on social media, check the source:\\n\\nDon’t believe in any information just because it is shared a lot or shared by someone you trust. Check the source of information. Is it from an authorized media or publication, a national or international health institution, or your trusted local organization/ community radio/local newspaper? If you do not find authorized source of the information, do not share or forward it further.\\n\\nFact-checking\\n\\nThere are platforms that can help us check facts such as Snopes, EUvsDisInfo, etc. South Asia Check has been debunking the myths and misinformation around coronavirus in the Nepali context. You can cross check the information using different search engines (Firefox, Google, DuckDuckGo, etc.) to find any reporting on it. Don’t share just any information via messaging apps or in your social media until then. If you come across any misinformation in your online circle, inform them about it and encourage them to delete/not to share.\\n\\nWorking to change human behavior\\n\\nIn the situation where the information is overloaded, we need to act smarter to change human behavior in terms of consuming and sharing of misinformation. People should be skeptic about the information they consume and the sources from which that information comes should also be under scrutiny.\\n\\nUse of media and social media responsibly\\n\\nMedia can debunk the misinformation after fact-checking. Improve the heading of the articles instead of focusing on click-bait. When you find misinformation being circulated in your network and community, direct them to the trusted source or share the content in the language they can understand. Some reliable sources are WHO Information Network for Epidemics, COVID-19 Nepal and Nepal Corona Information. Digital literacy becomes important here so people know how to navigate truth and facts amid tons of information around them. Media can also work to make government responsible to share correct information and data to the public to control spread of rumors and misinformation.\\n\\nUse of technology\\n\\nWhile using the fact-checking tools we already have, we can make use of more tools for fact-checking and verification. Technology companies could be supported to build such technology by other stakeholders through financial or human resource support. We need mechanism and technology to counter misinformation and disinformation along with legal action against those who spread those information. In Taiwan, technology was used in many ways from managing the panic-buying of face-masks to countering misinformation and disinformation.\\n\\nSupport social media platforms and make them accountable\\n\\nIf you think any social media content could be misinformation, report them. Social media are also working to counter misinformation. Companies like Facebook and Twitter have been trying to combat misinformation through content moderation and by providing factual information related to COVID-19, however, we can do our share of work too. While we support and appreciate the effort of social media platform, we also need adequate non-English content moderation.\\n(Shubha Kayastha is Executive Director at Body & Data that works in digital rights from the lens of gender and sexuality in Nepal)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in its 2012 report concluded that, “there exists a credible allegation amounting to a reasonable basis for suspicion that a violation of international law has occurred” and “these cases merit the prompt, impartial, independent and effective investigate by competent judicial authorities.”\\nThe government and the Maoists signed the peace agreement to put an end to the ongoing conflict. The agreement was founded on the commitment to uphold the human rights and international law. The two parties mutually agreed to set up the truth commission for successfully carrying out the transitional justice (TJ) process.\\nTJ process is primarily based on the political structure of the nation and social contemplation of past violations. The global practice of TJ includes formation of the truth-seeking commission, prosecution of alleged violations, vetting, compensation and reparation to the victims. Nepal has developed the TJ governing law to implement the peace agreement. The Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (EDETRC) Act, was passed and promulgated by the parliament in 2014.\\nThe act set up two high-level mechanisms: Truth and Reconciliation and Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. These commissions are mandated to register complaints, investigate, mediate and recommend names of the perpetrators for judicial prosecution.\\nThe end goal of these mechanism is to create an atmosphere for reconciliation and ensure violations are not repeated. Even after years of formation, the commission and its independency is in utmost controversy. The commission was first formed in 2015 and as it could not significantly deliver much even after term extension, the mechanism is currently vacant. A new list of commissioners are ready to take the positions for the next number of years. What status quo evinces is: delivering on transitional justice is not really the priority for the government, regardless of the party alliance, and that the commitment expressed while signing the peace agreement, is now no more obliging in the contemporary politics of Nepal.\\nDelay Promotes Impunity\\nMedia Foundation estimated in its report in 2011 that the decade-long conflict claimed around 17,265 lives, left 4,305 disabled, 78,675 dispossessed and displaced, thousands of civilians tortured, and hundreds of women/girls victims of rape and other forms of sexual violence. The whereabouts of around 1,302 is still unknown.\\xa0\\nThis is the rough figure of what has been inflicted by the war on the state and the people. The figure and reports on cases of violations reflect the disregard and contempt for human rights that resulted in barbaric acts during the conflict. Institutional impunity for these crimes have outraged the conscience of mankind.\\nConflict victims view the legislation as a tool that allows the perpetrators to enjoy impunity. Less has been done to hold anybody accountable for the list of violations. Successful TJ programs recognize the centrality of victims and their special status in design of such process. Prevailing law is not victim-centric and it also contravenes with the established human rights principle.\\nThe OHCHR Note outlined that the act does not provide sufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality of the commissioners.\\nCommenting on specific provisions of the act, the note highlighted that clause 13(2) and (3) suggests that the diversion of conflict-related cases from criminal justice process to the TJ commissions for consideration. This will eventually result in criminal investigation or prosecutions being possibly delayed, prevented or even denied.\\nThe act drew criticism as it was drafted extraneously and without scaling of international standards that Nepal abides by. The provisions of the act on investigation, prosecution, amnesty, reconciliations do not comply with the international standards. TJ process not only concerns about the monitoring, documenting or reconciliation of the violations, it also focuses on seeking the truth behind the crimes, providing justice to the victims, ensuring right to knowledge and establishing accountability on the part of the wrongdoers.\\nPrinciple 19 of the UN Updated Principles on Combating Impunity provides that, states shall undertake prompt, thorough, independent and impartial investigations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and take appropriate measures in respect of the perpetrators, particularly in the area of criminal justice, by ensuring that those responsible for serious crimes under international law are prosecuted, tried and duly punished.\\nClause 22 of the act has empowered the commission to start mediation and proceeding reconciliation after the application has been filed by either party. The provision purports a situation where the commission could play a major role in concluding reconciliation between the parties, even when either of them files the application for mediation without other party agreeing to it.\\nLaw Delivering Ineffective Remedy\\nArticle 8 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states, “Everyone has the right to an effective remedy by the competent national tribunals for acts violating the fundamental rights granted to him by the constitution or by law.” The primary law regulating the TJ process of Nepal ignores the right of effective remedy facilitated by the competent national tribunals. Clause 2(e) of the act defines “reparation” as “compensation, facility or concession made available to the victims as stipulated in Clause 23.” Where Clause 23(1) reads “reparation”, including “compensation, restitution or rehabilitation or any other appropriate arrangement to the victim.”\\nThe assertion of law depends on how definite the words of law are. Definition of “reparation” should be made more assertive by specifying the victim’s right to reparation, which also entails to right to restitution, compensation, and rehabilitation, measures of “satisfaction” and guarantees of non-recurrence.\\nTJ process assists post-conflict and transitional societies in investigating past human rights violations and bring out the know-how of the events taken place. The right of individuals to know the truth is supported by several treaty bodies, regional courts, and international tribunals. TJ commissions are non-judicial by nature. The best it can do is, map out patterns of past violence and conclude on how these destructive events developed into war crimes. This is an incremental step toward realizing the right to know the truth.\\nFor the effective implementation of the right to truth, a strong and credible documentation system is prerequisite. The TJ commissions have recorded thousands of complaints. But to look into the merits of the case has been a far cry for the mechanism. Delay in functioning of the TJ commissions, have already caused vulnerability in securing evidence against the violations. Timely investigation and documentation of the complaints, would have generated a rich source of information regarding the history of conflict and the repressive actions of the state actors. Archiving of the complaints, securing the imminent evidence and subsequent development of documents was vital to ensuring victims’ and societies’ right to the truth. On these matters, Nepal as a state has failed in its obligations.\\nA Non-Concluding Remark\\nCivil society members, human rights activists and people of Nepal have been voicing for establishing the accountability for violations committed during the conflict, but progress remains measurably slow. The Cabinet passed the amendment draft and is ready to proceed the draft in the House. The draft has been clearly rejected by the victims and other interest groups. The draft has failed to incorporate the orders of the court, recommendation by victims, international organization and previous commission enquiries.\\nIn this pretext, a sense of doubt on the ownership of the mechanism is palpable. In order to regain confidence, prosecution should start immediately, in the cases where court has already issued arrest warrant or writ of mandamus. The next step would be to amendment in the law as a way-out to slot in the resentments of the victims and to widen the rationale of transitional justice.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\n                            All the doctors were back from their morning rounds to have lunch. That is the time when they can laugh at each others’ jokes, plan classes for their students, and discuss issues of their patient.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr Jeevan (name changed) was almost 30 minutes late for his food that day. The rest of the group was joking about him as everyone knew how he grabs his bread, both pieces together when he is hungry. But there was something unusual about Dr Jeevan that day. He sighed and told everyone that he had to ventilate a 15-year-old boy, Sangharsha (name changed), who had come from very far. The boy was diagnosed with Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).\\r\\n\\r\\nGBS is a rare disorder in which body’s immune system attacks its own nerves, causing paralysis of the whole body. Paralysis starts in the feet and gradually ascends upwards and involves the upper limbs. At times, it also involves respiratory muscles and the patient is not able to breathe and requires mechanical ventilation. The exact cause of this illness is not known but it is often preceded by an infectious illness such as a respiratory infection or diarrhea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no cure for GBS but a drug called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), if given at an early stage of illness, can speed recovery and reduce the severity of the illness. Most of the time patients will be able to walk independently in six months. In Sangharsha’s case, his paralysis was very rapid. Mechanical ventilation alone would not be enough and IVIG was very expensive, about Rs 80,000 a day and had to be given for five days, for a total cost of Rs 400,000. There are also other added costs for treatment in the intensive care unit.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr. Jeevan was feeling helpless and at the same time guilty for ventilating Sangharsha. He knew without IVIG and with only a mechanical ventilator, it would be very difficult to save Sangharsha. Sangharsha’s father is a farmer. They come from a small beautiful village in Dhading around 50 kilometers from Kathmandu, a three-hour trek from the nearest bus stop.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe has three elder sisters. When Sangharsha and his father left for Kathmandu, his mother remained home to take care of the girls, their mud house, their millet farm yard, and a goat. When they arrived at the hospital, his father had only Rs15,000.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that amount of money, treatment for Sangharsha would be next to impossible even at the government-owned Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital (TUTH) where he was admitted. The healthcare system in Nepal has no insurance plans and treatment is almost always out of pocket. All the money had already been spent on other medicines and investigations, with none left for the life-saving drug, IVIG.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Sangharsha was under the care of experts, the treating doctors and his father already knew the painful reality. Keeping Sangharsha on a ventilator would just prolong his sufferings. Doctors had already concluded that he could not be saved.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the doctors were discussing Sangharsha’s conditions, one of them blurted out “Poverty is killing more people than the diseases!” This is a cliché among the doctors, and no one in the room paid much attention.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the corner of the room, another young doctor, Dr Asha (name changed), seemed oblivious to the discussions and was focused on her mobile. But unknown to the rest she had already started to look for funds.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe created a Viber group of her friends and family, and told them about Sangharsha’s condition and their treatment dilemma. To her surprise, within half an hour she had received many responses and before long enough money was raised for one day of IVIG. There was a ripple effect in this group.\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the next 48 hours, there was an overwhelming response from near and far. Even a very small amount, when put together was sufficient enough for another two days of IVIG. There were discussions and disagreements as to whether spending so much money on IVIG for one child with such grim outlook was the right thing to do. Wouldn’t this money be better used for many other patients? The doctor who started this drive had many sleepless nights wrestling with this question, but she followed her heart and did not stop. She believed deeply that what she was doing to save this boy’s life was right.\\r\\n\\r\\nSangharsha received three doses of IVIG. He was breathing with the help of a mechanical ventilator and was awake and alert, but he could not speak. His only means of communicating was blinking his eyes. At times he felt bored and depressed. Once he needed his back scratched and no one understood him and his blinks. He cried in frustration and his tears did not stop for several hours. It was heart-wrenching to see him sob and unable to express himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe continuous noise of monitors and ventilators, the constant changing of very sick children in the beds next to him because they did not make it, and his doctors discussing his prognosis in low voices and sad faces made him feel even more distressed. He gradually started to lose hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about six days, his father wanted to take him home, even though he knew his son wouldn’t be able to breathe if all the tubes were removed. Later it was discovered that the father had not eaten for days and was starving. He was not even sleeping, as he had to be constantly available to get medicines and other things necessary for his son’s care. The caring nursing staff planned for food, and some even shared their own tiffin. From that day on, he was not called during the night-time so he could get enough rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter about three days, the father was a little settled, but boredom was deeply grasping Sangharsha. To help keep him entertained and his mind active, doctors and nurses played Nepali movies in their phones for him. Sangharsha watched one particular Nepali movie almost 20 times!\\r\\n\\r\\nSangharsha was a fighter. After 15 days, he acquired a severe chest infection, requiring high doses of very strong antibiotics. This time money for his treatment came from Indra Jawahar Kosh, a private charity that provides financial support to under-privileged children.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe antibiotics and Sangharsha’s fighting spirit were effective and he came back from the brink. Also, while he was on the ventilator, the tube accidently came out several times, requiring multiple reinsertions. When multiple attempts for tube reinsertion are required, the child is less likely to make it, but this was not the case for Sangharsha. As with his recovery from the chest infection, Sangharsha proved once again that he was not giving up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the days passed by, the treating doctors, including Dr Jeevan and Dr Asha, became increasingly skeptical regarding his outcome despite his progress. Even on the third week of ventilation, his muscle strength was not improving and it appeared he would require longer ventilation.\\r\\n\\r\\nLonger ventilation does not just mean more expenses but also increasing possibility of an adverse outcome. Whenever longer ventilation is required, the option is to perform tracheostomy i.e. creating an opening in the windpipe from outside and attaching the ventilator tubes through this opening. The outer opening is temporary and can be closed after few months. But the procedure itself can present many complications and, though very rare, can even take person’s life because of massive bleeding from the opening.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe father was counseled regarding the benefits and risks of a tracheostomy but chose not to allow the procedure. Although Sangharsha agreed to it, several attempts to convince his father failed. This created an ethical dilemma regarding further treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nProlonging ventilation meant risking more infections and complications. One of the dreaded complications is the narrowing of the windpipe rendering the person unable to take enough air without any tubings. Even if Sangharsha were to recover from paralysis, because of the narrow windpipe he wouldn’t be able to breathe sufficiently on his own.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo everyone’s surprise it was found that the father was resisting because he had been told by a faith-healer to not make any disfigurement on the boy’s body.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven with all the skills, knowledge, and resources of the health care system, sometimes deep-rooted superstitious beliefs challenge you and make you accept it despite no scientific basis. Since the father was going against the child’s best interest, Dr Asha took the role of an advocate for the child.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn expert in medical ethics was consulted and then it was decided to seek help from lawyers, hospital administrators, and police if the father did not comply with the treatment. But even here there was some disagreement among doctors because after a tracheostomy, very skilled and gentle care of the opening is required, and there was doubt as to whether Sangharsha’s father or mother would be able to do it at home.\\r\\n\\r\\nFortunately, on that very day the tube accidentally came out, the doctors decided not to put the tube in again and Sangharsha was given oxygen through a face mask. He seemed to tolerate it, and though his breathing was not optimal, he managed to get enough oxygen.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone now was keeping his/her fingers crossed. Soon he started to move his little finger and after another five days he was slowly able to breathe on his own. His feeding tube, which was inserted through his nose when he arrived at the hospital, was taken out after 34 days and he gradually started to swallow. Though he was not able to move his limbs or body, now he could talk very clearly. On day 42, able to talk clearly though still unable to move his limbs or body, Sangharsha was finally discharged from the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nSangharsha was destined to live. For everyone in the hospital it appeared to be a miracle.\\r\\n\\r\\nMiracles do happen but they don't happen on their own. Help poured in from people all around. Dr Asha listened to her heart and did not think of the mountain of medical statistics against the odds, and raised enough funds for his successful treatment.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe multiple re-intubations did not cause any problem in his throat. Most times intubation and re-intubation cause lots of problems in patients, including making it difficult to regain their voice. But for Sangharsha, his father’s intuition, superstition rather, turned out to be a savior. Sangharsha could even sing when he left the hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed to be divine intervention and Sangharsha won the battle.\\r\\n\\r\\nDr Asha is still troubled about what she did. What if Sangharsha had not have made it? How would she have answered to all the generous people from Nepal and Nepalis in the US and other well-wishers who donated their hard-earned money at her request? What would she answer to those who told IVIG shouldn't be used for this kid as the same amount of money could have saved many more lives? What would she have told his father if they had performed tracheostomy, and it had failed?\\r\\n\\r\\n(The author works at the Department of Child Health, Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\n                            When a heavy star dies, its core ends up as either a black hole or a neutron star. Scientists have a good understanding of most of the puzzles associated with black holes, thanks to the general theory of relativity Albert Einstein formulated in early 1900. However, many mysteries about neutron stars are yet to be understood.\\r\\n\\r\\nDinesh Kandel, a young Nepali researcher and a Ph. D. student at Stanford University is currently working at the forefront of the field, pursuing a deeper understanding of this exotic object.\\r\\n\\r\\nBorn in Chitwan, Dinesh completed his schooling from Budhanilkantha School. He recalls being particularly passionate about physics during his high school days at St. Xavier's College. This passion led to his participation in the International Physics Olympiad in Thailand, where he won a bronze medal for Nepal. Due to this achievement, he was offered a full scholarship by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, one of Asia’s premier institutions. Currently, he works at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University on the theoretical and observational studies of neutron stars.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nDinesh Kandel. Photo Courtesy: Stanford University website\\r\\n\\r\\nNeutron stars are one of the densest objects in our universe and are over 10 trillion times denser than iron. “A teaspoon of a neutron star weighs about as much as our Mt. Everest. Because of the extreme density, the pressure inside the star’s core is so high that most of the charged particles merge forming a star composed primarily of uncharged particles - neutrons,” Kandel says.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne perplexity about neutron stars is how heavy they could be. Scientists believe that these objects can’t be over three times heavier than our Sun, otherwise, such a heavy mass would lead to a total gravitational collapse forming black holes. Another mystery is how a neutron star’s mass and radius depend on each other. Solving these puzzles is crucial in understanding what kinds of matter exist inside a neutron star.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo help solve these puzzles, Kandel has been developing techniques to estimate masses of neutron stars by studying their light pattern. “Many neutron stars are not found isolated in the sky but are found orbiting another star, similar to our earth-moon system.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince neutron stars emit remarkably energetic light and particles, in such cases, beams of energy from the neutron star splash the surface of the companion star and makes the star almost as hot as our sun. These hot systems emit light of wide frequency-range — from optical light that our eyes can see to X-rays to light of even higher frequencies,” Kandel says.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo observe these light signals from the neutron star systems, scientists have commissioned different telescopes. The optical light is monitored using terrestrial telescopes of large size, and the x-ray is monitored through space-based telescopes, two of which are NASA’s Chandra telescope and European Space Agency’s (ESA) XMM-Newton telescope.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nThe sky pattern of neutron star system’s X-ray light. The pattern looks like a bright and dark double ring. (source: Kandel et al. 2019)\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his recent works published in The Astrophysical Journal Kandel has proposed a detailed theoretical model of how the neutron star binary systems emit X-ray light. “Both neutron star and its companion star have extremely energetic winds colliding with each other. Because of this collision, electrons are accelerated to extremely high energies. Because space around neutron stars has a high magnetic field, these electrons emit a distinct signature of X-ray light,” Kandel says.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this published study, Kandel has accurately analyzed X-ray light from two neutron star systems using the data from the Chandra and XMM telescopes and modeled some important properties of two neutron stars. Modeling the real data with his proposed theory has provided some exciting predictions for the mass of these systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe found that both neutron stars are more than two times heavier than our Sun. “Although these results are encouraging, we need more work and more data to work on. The future is challenging, at the same time exciting,” Kandel says.\\r\\nKandel’s research article can be read at https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab24d9\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nGenetic material collected at a Chinese market near where the first human cases of COVID-19 were identified show raccoon dog DNA comingled with the virus, adding evidence to the theory that the virus originated from animals, not from a lab, international experts say.\\n“These data do not provide a definitive answer to how the pandemic began, but every piece of data is important to moving us closer to that answer,” World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Friday.\\nHow the coronavirus emerged remains unclear. Many scientists believe it most likely jumped from animals to people, as many other viruses have in the past, at a wildlife market in Wuhan, China. But Wuhan is home to several labs involved in collecting and studying coronaviruses, fueling theories scientists say are plausible that the virus may have leaked from one.\\nThe new findings do not settle the question, and they have not been formally reviewed by other experts or published in a peer-reviewed journal.\\nTedros criticized China for not sharing the genetic information earlier, telling a press briefing that “this data could have and should have been shared three years ago.”\\nThe samples were collected from surfaces at the Huanan seafood market in early 2020 in Wuhan, where the first human cases of COVID-19 were found in late 2019.\\nTedros said the genetic sequences were recently uploaded to the world’s biggest public virus database by scientists at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThey were then removed, but not before a French biologist spotted the information by chance and shared it with a group of scientists based outside China that’s looking into the origins of the coronavirus.\\nThe data show that some of the COVID-positive samples collected from a stall known to be involved in the wildlife trade also contained raccoon dog genes, indicating the animals may have been infected by the virus, according to the scientists. Their analysis was first reported in The Atlantic.\\n“There’s a good chance that the animals that deposited that DNA also deposited the virus,” said Stephen Goldstein, a virologist at the University of Utah who was involved in analyzing the data. “If you were to go and do environmental sampling in the aftermath of a zoonotic spillover event … this is basically exactly what you would expect to find.”\\nThe canines, named for their raccoon-like faces, are often bred for their fur and sold for meat in animal markets across China.\\nRay Yip, an epidemiologist and founding member of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control office in China, said the findings are significant, even though they aren’t definitive.\\n“The market environmental sampling data published by China CDC is by far the strongest evidence to support animal origins,” Yip told the AP in an email. He was not connected to the new analysis.\\nWHO’s COVID-19 technical lead, Maria Van Kerkhove, cautioned that the analysis did not find the virus within any animal, nor did it find any hard evidence that any animals infected humans.\\n“What this does provide is clues to help us understand what may have happened,” she said. The international group also told WHO they found DNA from other animals as well as raccoon dogs in the samples from the seafood market, she added.\\nThe coronavirus’ genetic code is strikingly similar to that of bat coronaviruses, and many scientists suspect COVID-19 jumped into humans either directly from a bat or via an intermediary animal like pangolins, ferrets or racoon dogs.\\nEfforts to determine the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic have been complicated by factors including the massive surge of human infections in the pandemic’s first two years and an increasingly bitter political dispute.\\nIt took virus experts more than a dozen years to pinpoint the animal origin of SARS, a related virus.\\nGoldstein and his colleagues say their analysis is the first solid indication that there may have been wildlife infected with the coronavirus at the market. But it is also possible that humans brought the virus to the market and infected the raccoon dogs, or that infected humans simply happened to leave traces of the virus near the animals.\\nAfter scientists in the group contacted the China CDC, they say, the sequences were removed from the global virus database. Researchers are puzzled as to why data on the samples collected over three years ago wasn’t made public sooner. Tedros has pleaded with China to share more of its COVID-19 research data.\\nGao Fu, the former head of the Chinese CDC and lead author of the Chinese paper, didn’t immediately respond to an Associated Press email requesting comment. But he told Science magazine the sequences are “nothing new. It had been known there was illegal animal dealing and this is why the market was immediately shut down.”\\nGoldstein said his group presented its findings this week to a WHO advisory panel investigating COVID-19’s origins.\\nMichael Imperiale of the University of Michigan, a microbiology and immunology expert who was not involved in the data analysis, said finding a sample with sequences from the virus and a raccoon dog “places the virus and the dog in very close proximity. But it doesn’t necessarily say that the dog was infected with the virus; it just says that they were in the same very small area.”\\nHe said the bulk of the scientific evidence at this point supports a natural exposure at the market, and pointed to research published last summer showing the market was likely the early epicenter of the scourge and concluding that the virus spilled from animals into people two separate times. “What’s the chance that there were two different lab leaks?” he asked.\\nMark Woolhouse, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Edinburgh, said it will be crucial to see how the raccoon dogs’ genetic sequences match up to what’s known about the historic evolution of the COVID-19 virus. If the dogs are shown to have COVID and those viruses prove to have earlier origins than the ones that infected people, “that’s probably as good evidence as we can expect to get that this was a spillover event in the market.”\\nAfter a weeks-long visit to China to study the pandemic’s origins, WHO released a report in 2021 concluding that COVID-19 most probably jumped into humans from animals, dismissing the possibility of a lab origin as “extremely unlikely.”\\nBut the U.N. health agency backtracked the following year, saying “key pieces of data” were still missing. And Tedros has said all hypotheses remain on the table.\\nThe China CDC scientists who previously analyzed the Huanan market samples published a paper as a preprint in February suggesting that humans brought the virus to the market, not animals, implying that the virus originated elsewhere. Their paper didn’t mention that animal genes were found in the samples that tested positive.\\nIn February, the Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Department of Energy had assessed “with low confidence” that the virus had leaked from a lab. But others in the U.S. intelligence community disagree, believing it more likely it first came from animals.\\nExperts say the true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years — if ever.\\n',\n",

Some agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and the State Department already have restrictions in place. The White House already does not allow TikTok on its devices.\\nCongress passed the “No TikTok on Government Devices Act” in December as part of a sweeping government funding package. The legislation does allow for TikTok use in certain cases, including for national security, law enforcement and research purposes.\\nMeanwhile, lawmakers in both the House and Senate have been moving forward with legislation that would give the Biden administration more power to clamp down on TikTok.\\nTikTok remains extremely popular and is used by two-thirds of teens in the U.S. But there is increasing concern that Beijing could obtain control of American user data that the app has obtained and push pro-Beijing narratives and propaganda on the app.\\nChina has long been concerned about the influence of overseas social media and communications apps, and bans most of the best-known ones, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube — and TikTok.\\n',\n",

The upscale area of Zaman Park where Khan lives was under siege since Tuesday. The government was sending additional police to tackle the situation after hundreds of Khan’s supporters showed unexpected perseverance.\\nEarly Wednesday, Khan emerged from his house to meet with his supporters, who faced tear gas and police batons the whole night to save him from arrest. He said he was ready to travel to Islamabad on March 18 under his arrest warrant, but police did not accept the offer.\\nThe confrontation outside Khan’s house continued.\\nAbout a dozen police and some 35 of Khan’s supporters were reported injured. Tear gas shells and pieces of bricks littered the pavement as Khan’s followers fought back with batons they had brought to resist police, who were preparing for a final effort to arrest Khan.\\nKhan, who was ousted in a no-confidence vote in Parliament in April, was ordered to appear before a judge in Islamabad on Friday to answer charges of illegally selling state gifts he had received during his term as premier and concealing his assets.\\nThe former premier has avoided appearances before the court since November, when he was wounded in a gun attack at a protest rally in the eastern Punjab province, claiming he was not medically fit to travel from Lahore to Islamabad to face indictment.\\nLast week, he went to Islamabad to appear before three courts, but he failed to appear before the fourth court to face indictment in the graft case, which is a legal process for starting his trial.\\nKhan has claimed that the string of cases against him, which includes terrorism charges, are a plot by the government of his successor, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, to discredit the former cricket star turned Islamist politician.\\nOn Tuesday, Sharif told Pakistan’s Geo television that Khan’s arrest was ordered by a court, and it was not political victimization.\\n“We will arrest him, and will do it on a court order,” Shahzad Bukhari, deputy-inspector general of Islamabad police, told reporters earlier in Lahore.

       "  '\\nWhen a Russian fighter jet collided with a large U.S. surveillance drone over the Black Sea on Tuesday, it was a rare but serious incident that triggered a U.S. diplomatic protest and raised concerns about the possibility Russia could recover sensitive technology.\\nU.S. and Russian officials had conflicting accounts of the collision between the MQ-9 Reaper drone and the Russian Su-27 fighter jet — each blaming the other. But a Pentagon spokesman raised the possibility that the Defense Department could eventually declassify and release video it has of the collision.\\nDefense officials said the drone has not been recovered. But the Pentagon declined to say whether any effort was underway to gather debris or pieces of the Reaper.\\nHere’s what’s known — and uncertain — about the crash.\\nWHAT THE US SAYS HAPPENED\\nThe Pentagon and U.S. European Command said that two Russian Su-27 aircraft dumped fuel on the MQ-9, which was conducting a routine surveillance mission over the Black Sea in international airspace. They said the Russian jets flew around and in front of the drone several times for 30 to 40 minutes, and then one of the Russian aircraft “struck the propeller of the MQ-9, causing U.S. forces to have to bring the MQ-9 down in international waters.”\\nAir Force Gen. James Hecker, commander of U.S. Air Forces Europe and Africa, said that the Russian jet’s actions “nearly caused both aircraft to crash.” Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said the collision likely also damaged the Russian fighter jet, but the Su-27 was able to land. He would not say where it landed.\\nThe Pentagon said the drone was “well clear” of any Ukrainian territory, but did not provide details. A U.S. defense official said it was operating west of Crimea over the Black Sea. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to provide mission details.\\nIt’s not clear if the collision was an accident or intentional, but both sides agree the Russian aircraft were trying to intercept the drone.\\nWHAT RUSSIA SAYS HAPPENED\\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said the U.S. drone was flying near the Russian border and intruded in an area that was declared off limits by Russian authorities. It said that the Russian military scrambled fighters to intercept the U.S. drone. It claimed that “as a result of sharp maneuver, the U.S. drone went into uncontrollable flight with a loss of altitude and collided with water surface.”\\nRussia has declared broad areas near Crimea off limits to flights. Ever since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and long before Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Moscow has charged that U.S. surveillance planes were flying too close to its borders while ignoring the notices issued by Russia.\\nNations routinely operate in international airspace and waters, and no country can claim limits on territory outside of its own border.\\nThe ministry said the Russian aircraft were scrambled to intercept the drone but didn’t use their weapons and “didn’t come into contact” with it.\\nWHAT IS AN MQ-9 REAPER?\\nThe MQ-9 Reaper is a large unmanned Air Force aircraft that is remotely operated by a two-person team. It includes a ground control station and satellite equipment and has a 66-foot (20-meter) wingspan. The team includes a rated pilot who is responsible for flying the aircraft and an enlisted aircrew member who is charged with operating the sensors and guiding weapons.\\nUsed routinely during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for surveillance and airstrikes, the Reaper can be either armed or unarmed. It can carry up to eight laser-guided missiles, including Hellfire missiles and other sophisticated munitions, and can loiter over targets for about 24 hours. It is about 36 feet long, 12 feet high, and weighs about 4,900 pounds (11 meters long, 4 meters high, and 2,200 kilograms). It can fly at an altitude of up to 50,000 feet (15 kilometers) and has a range of about 1,400 nautical miles (2,500 kilometers).\\nThe Reaper, which first began operating in 2007, replaced the Air Force’s smaller Predator drones. Each Reaper costs about $32 million.\\nDIPLOMATIC DUST-UP\\nThe collision triggered a diplomatic protest.\\nThe U.S. State Department summoned Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov to a meeting Tuesday with Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for Europe.\\n“We are engaging directly with the Russians, again at senior levels, to convey our strong objections to this unsafe, unprofessional intercept, which caused the downing of the unmanned U.S. aircraft,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.\\nAnd White House National Security spokesman John Kirby said the U.S. will be “expressing our concerns over this unsafe and unprofessional intercept.”\\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin had not talked to his Russian counterpart regarding the incident, Ryder said.\\nHAS IT HAPPENED BEFORE?\\nThis is not the first time Russian aircraft have flown so close to U.S. aircraft in the Black Sea that it’s prompted the Pentagon to publicly condemn the incident for putting the crews at risk. In 2020, Russian jets crossed in front of a B-52 bomber that was flying over the Black Sea, and flew as close as 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the bomber’s nose, causing turbulence.\\nRussian jets have also buzzed U.S. warships during exercises in the Black Sea. In 2021, Russian warplanes buzzed the USS Donald Cook, a Navy destroyer, which had been taking part in a major exercise. Until Russia’s invasion last year of Ukraine, U.S. warships more frequently deployed to the Black Sea in response to Russia’s 2014 attack on Crimea.\\nFor the most part, however, military intercepts — either in the air or at sea — are routine and have happened a number of times with Russian aircraft in the Pacific, particularly in the north. Just last month, U.S. fighter jets intercepted two Russian TU-95 bombers in international airspace off Alaska’s coast, and “escorted them” for 12 minutes, according to the Pentagon.\\nAnd Russian aircraft have done similar missions, and also buzzed U.S. Navy ships in the Pacific. In most of the cases, the intercepts are deemed safe and professional.\\nIt’s not clear if the Russian pilots were willing to get closer to the Reaper or dump fuel on it because they knew it was unmanned — and therefore there was no risk to an American pilot or crew. The deliberate downing of a manned aircraft — injuring or killing crew members — could be considered an act of war.\\n',\n",

Its infrared eyes observed all the gas and dust flung into space by a huge, hot star 15,000 light-years away. A light-year is about 5.8 trillion miles.\\nShimmering in purple like a cherry blossom, the cast-off material once comprised the star’s outer layer.

It’s really exciting,” said Macarena Garcia Marin, a European Space Agency scientist who is part of the project.\\nThis star in the constellation Sagittarius, officially known as WR 124, is 30 times as massive as our sun and already has shed enough material to account for 10 suns, according to NASA.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nNorth Korea test-fired two short-range ballistic missiles in another show of force Tuesday, a day after the United States and South Korea began military drills that Pyongyang views as an invasion rehearsal.\\nThe missiles launched from the southwestern coastal town of Jangyon flew across North Korea before landing in the sea off that country’s east coast, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement. It said both missiles traveled about 620 kilometers (385 miles).\\nThe reported flight distances suggest the missiles target South Korea, which hosts about 28,000 U.S. troops. South Korea’s military called the launches “a grave provocation” that undermines stability on the Korean Peninsula.\\nThe U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Tuesday’s launches don’t pose an immediate threat to its allies. But it said the North’s recent tests highlight the “destabilizing impact” of the North’s unlawful weapons programs and that the U.S. security commitment to South Korea and Japan remains “ironclad.”\\nJapanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told reporters that officials were still gathering details of the North Korean launches and there were no immediate reports of damage in Japanese waters.\\nPyongyang could further escalate its weapons tests over the coming days in a tit-for-tat response to the allies’ military drills, which are planned to run until March 23. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered his troops to be ready to repel what he called the “frantic war preparations moves” by his country’s rivals.\\nWorries about North Korea’s nuclear program have grown sharply after the North test-fired more than 70 missiles in 2022, many of them nuclear-capable weapons, and openly threatened to use them in potential conflicts with the United States and South Korea.\\nNorth Korea appears to be using long-stalled talks with Washington and the expanding U.S.-South Korean drills as a chance to enlarge its weapons arsenals to increase its leverage in future dealings with the United States.\\nThe North Korean threats, along with China’s increasing assertiveness, have pushed the U.S. to seek to reinforce its alliances with South Korea and Japan. But some experts say a solidified Washington-Seoul-Tokyo cooperation could prompt Pyongyang, Beijing and Moscow to strengthen their own trilateral ties.\\nChina and Russia, embroiled in separate confrontations with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S. and its allies’ bids to toughen United Nations sanctions on North Korea.\\nTuesday’s launches were the North’s second weapons test this week. On Monday, North Korea said it had test-fired two cruise missiles from a submarine the previous day. It implied the cruise missiles were being developed to carry nuclear warheads, though outside experts debate whether Pyongyang possesses functioning nuclear-armed missiles.\\nSubmarine-launched missile systems are harder to detect and would provide the North retaliatory second attack capability. But experts say it would take years, extensive resources and major technological improvements for the heavily sanctioned nation to build a fleet of submarines that could travel quietly and reliably execute strikes.\\nU.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Monday that North Korea has been refining its submarine-launch capabilities since its first test in 2016, and the United States was studying Sunday’s launches to assess the North’s capabilities.\\n“But of course, we’re not going to let any steps North Korea takes deter us or constrain us from the actions that we feel are necessary to safeguard stability on the Korean Peninsula,” Sullivan said.\\nThe U.S.-South Korean joint exercises that started Monday include computer simulations involving North Korean aggression and other security scenarios and field exercises. The field exercises would return to the scale of the allies’ biggest springtime exercises that were last held in 2018, according to South Korean defense officials.\\nThe two countries have been expanding their drills as North Korean nuclear threats have been growing.\\nU.S.-South Korea drills will proceed normally, regardless of whether “North Korea tries to disrupt them with provocations like missile launches,” Jeon Ha Gyu, spokesperson of South Korea’s Defense Ministry, said Tuesday. U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Monday the United States has made clear it harbors no hostile intent toward North Korea and that the allies’ longstanding exercises are “purely defensive in nature.”\\nHolding telephone talks for the second consecutive day to discuss the North Korean launches, the chief South Korean and U.S. nuclear envoys stressed Tuesday that the North would face “clear consequences” for its actions, without specifying what those would be. They said the allies will maintain “firm readiness” to respond to any kind of North Korean provocation, according to Seoul’s Foreign Ministry.\\nLater this week, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol is to visit Tokyo for a summit with Kishida, where the North Korean threat is expected to be a major topic. The shared urgency over security is pushing Seoul and Tokyo closer together following years of disputes stemming from Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula before the end of World War II.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nChinese President Xi Jinping called Monday for China to play a bigger role in managing global affairs after Beijing scored a diplomatic coup as the host of talks that produced an agreement by Saudi Arabia and Iran to reopen diplomatic relations.\\nXi gave no details of the ruling Communist Party’s plans in a speech to China’s ceremonial legislature. But Beijing has been increasingly assertive since he took power in 2012 and called for changes in the International Monetary Fund and other entities it says fail to reflect the desires of developing countries.\\nChina should “actively participate in the reform and construction of the global governance system” and promote “global security initiatives,” said Xi, the country’s most powerful leader in decades.\\nThat will add “positive energy to world peace and development,” Xi said.\\nOn Friday, Xi was named to another term in the ceremonial presidency after breaking with tradition in October and awarding himself a third-five year term as general secretary of the ruling party, putting himself on track to become leader for life.\\nThe National People’s Congress on Sunday cemented Xi’s dominance by endorsing the appointment of his loyalists as premier and other government leaders in a once-a-decade change. Xi has sidelined potential rivals and loaded the top ranks of the ruling party with his supporters.\\nThe new premier, Li Qiang, tried Monday to reassure entrepreneurs but gave no details of possible plans to improve conditions after Xi’s government spent the past decade building up state companies that control banking, energy, steel, telecoms and other industries.\\nLi’s comments echoed promises by other Chinese leaders over the past six months to support entrepreneurs who generate jobs and wealth. They have vowed to simplify regulations and taxes but have given no indication they plan to rein in state companies that entrepreneurs complain drain away their profits.\\nThe ruling party will “treat enterprises of all types of ownership equally” and “support the development and growth of private enterprises,” Li said.\\n“Our leading cadres at all levels must sincerely care about and serve private enterprises,” he said.\\nChinese officials earlier indicated anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns that knocked tens of billions of dollars off the stock market value of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group and other tech companies were ending. But entrepreneurs were rattled anew in February when a star banker who played a leading role in tech deals disappeared. Bao Fan’s company said he was “cooperating in an investigation” but gave no details.\\nLi said Beijing will make a priority of job creation as it tries to revive economic growth that sank to 3% last year, the second-lowest level in decades. This year’s official growth target is “around 5%.”\\nThe premier expressed confidence China can cope as its workforce shrinkage. The number of potential workers age 15 to 59 has fallen by more than 5% from its 2011 peak, an unusually abrupt decline for a middle-income country.\\nLi said that while China is losing its “demographic dividend” of young workers, better education means it is gaining a “talent dividend.” He said some 15 million people still enter the workforce every year.\\n“Abundant human resources is still China’s outstanding advantage,” he said.\\nAbroad, Beijing also has built on China’s growing heft as the second-largest economy to promote trade and construction initiatives that Washington, Tokyo, Moscow and New Delhi worry will expand its strategic influence at their expanse.\\nThose include the multibillion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative to construct ports, railways and other trade-related infrastructure across an arc of countries from the South Pacific through Asia to Africa and Europe. China also is promoting trade and security initiatives.\\nXi’s government rattled the United States and Australia in early 2022 when it signed an agreement with the Solomon Islands that would allow Chinese navy ships and security forces to be stationed in the South Pacific nation.\\nThe foreign minister, Qin Gang, warned Washington last week of possible “conflict and confrontation” if the United States doesn’t change course in relations that have been strained by conflicts over Taiwan, human rights, Hong Kong, security and technology.\\nXi called Monday for faster technology development and more self-reliance in a speech loaded with nationalistic terms. He referred eight times to “national rejuvenation,” or restoring China to its rightful place as an economic, cultural and political leader.\\nHe said that before the ruling party took power in 1949, China was “reduced to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country, subject to bullying by foreign countries.”\\n“We have finally washed away the national humiliation, and Chinese people are the master of their own destiny,” Xi said. “The Chinese nation has stood up, become rich and is becoming strong.”\\nXi also called for the country to “unswervingly achieve” the goal of “national reunification,” a reference to Beijing’s claim that Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy, is part of its territory and is obliged to unite with China, by force if necessary.\\n',\n",

A two-term limit on the figurehead presidency was deleted from the Chinese Constitution earlier, prompting suggestions he might stay in power for life.\\nNo candidate lists were distributed, and Xi and those awarded other posts were believed to have run unopposed. The election remains almost entirely shrouded in secrecy, apart from the process in which delegates to the congress put four ballots into boxes placed around the vast auditorium of the Great Hall of the People.\\nXi was also unanimously named commander of the 2 million-member People’s Liberation Army, a force that explicitly takes its orders from the party rather than the country.\\nIn other voting, the party’s third-ranking official, Zhao Leji, was named head of the National People’s Congress. The vast majority of the body’s legislative work is headed by its Standing Committee, which meets year-round.\\nZhao, 67, a holdover from the previous party Politburo Standing Committee, the apex of political power in China headed by Xi, won Xi’s trust as head of the party’s anti-corruption watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, pursuing an anti-graft campaign that has frozen all potential opposition to Xi.\\nFormer Shanghai party boss and member of the last Politburo Standing Committee Han Zheng was named to the largely ceremonial post of state vice president.\\nXi, Zhao and Han then took the oath of office with one hand on a copy of the Chinese Constitution. The session also swore in 14 congress vice chairpersons.\\nXi’s new term and the appointment of loyalists to top posts underscores his near-total monopoly on Chinese political power, eliminating any potential opposition to his hyper-nationalistic agenda of building China into the top political, military and economic rival to the U.S. and the chief authoritarian challenge to the Washington-led democratic world order.\\nWhile six others serve with him on the Politburo Standing Committee, all have longstanding ties to Xi and can be counted on to see to his will on issues from party discipline to economic management.\\nThe standing committee has only men and the 24-member Politburo, which has had only four female members since the 1990s, also has no women after the departure of Vice Premier Sun Chunlan.\\nSecond-ranked Li Qiang is widely expected to take over as premier, nominally in charge of the Cabinet and caretaker of the economy. Li is best known for ruthlessly enforcing a brutal “zero-COVID” lockdown on Shanghai last spring as party boss of the Chinese financial hub, proving his loyalty to Xi in the face of complaints from residents over their lack of access to food, medical care and basic services.\\nFormer head of the manufacturing powerhouse of Guangdong province, seventh-ranked Li Xi has already been appointed to replace Zhao as head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.\\nThe congress is also expected to pass a measures intensifying party control over national level government organs as part of Xi’s campaign of centralizing power under the party.\\nAt the opening of the annual congress session on Sunday, outgoing Premier Li Keqiang announced plans for a consumer-led revival of the struggling economy, setting this year’s growth target at “around 5%.” Last year’s growth in the world’s second-largest economy fell to 3%, the second-weakest level since at least the 1970s.\\nSeparately, the Ministry of Finance announced a 7.2% budget increase in the defense budget to 1.55 trillion yuan ($224 billion), marking a slight increase over 2022. China’s military spending is the world’s second highest after the United States.\\nIn the days then, Xi and his new Foreign Minister Qin Gang have set a highly combative tone for relations with the U.S., amid tensions over trade, technology, Taiwan, human rights and Beijing’s refusal to criticize Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\nOn Tuesday, Qin warned in unusually stark terms about the possibility of U.S.-China frictions leading to something more dire.\\n“If the United States does not hit the brake, but continues to speed down the wrong path, no amount of guardrails can prevent derailing and there surely will be conflict and confrontation,” Qin said in his first news conference since taking up his post last year.\\nThat echoed comments at a small group meeting of delegates from Xi on Monday, in which he said that “Western countries led by the United States have implemented all-round containment, encirclement and suppression of China, which has brought unprecedented grave challenges to our nation’s development.”\\nXi followed up on Wednesday by calling for “more quickly elevating the armed forces to world-class standards.”\\nChina must maximize its “national strategic capabilities” in a bid to “systematically upgrade the country’s overall strength to cope with strategic risks, safeguard strategic interests and realize strategic objectives,” Xi was quoted as saying to a meeting of delegates by the official Xinhua News Agency.\\nAsked about China’s future foreign relations under Xi, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning struck a relatively mild tone.\\nBeijing maintains an “independent foreign policy of peace” and will “continue to view and develop China-U.S. relations in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” Mao said at a daily briefing.\\n“We hope the U.S. side can also meet us halfway and push China-U.S. relations back on the track of sound and stable development,” she said.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nSince the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, the country has become the most repressive in the world for women and girls, deprived of virtually all their basic rights, the United Nations said in grim assessments on International Women’s Day.\\nThe U.N. Mission said in a statement Thursday that Afghanistan’s new rulers have shown an almost “singular focus on imposing rules that leave most women and girls effectively trapped in their homes.”\\nDespite initial promises of a more moderate stance, the Taliban have imposed harsh measures since seizing power as U.S. and NATO forces were in the final weeks of their pullout from Afghanistan after two decades of war.\\nGirls are banned from education beyond sixth grade and women are barred from working, studying, traveling without a male companion, and even going to parks or bath houses. Women must also cover themselves from head to toe and are barred from working at national and international non-governmental organizations, disrupting the delivery of humanitarian aid.\\n“Afghanistan under the Taliban remains the most repressive country in the world regarding women’s rights,” Roza Otunbayeva, special representative of the U.N. secretary-general and head of the U.N. political mission in Afghanistan, said in a statement.\\nShe later told the U.N. Security Council in New York that “the Taliban claim to have united the country, but they have also severely divided it by gender.” The Taliban tell the U.N. “that this gender segregation is not a significant issue and is being addressed” and “they say they should be judged on other achievements,” she said.\\nAt a time when Afghanistan needs to recover from decades of war, Otunbayeva said, “half of the country’s potential doctors, scientists, journalists, and politicians are shut away in their homes, their dreams crushed and their talents confiscated.”\\n“It has been distressing to witness their methodical, deliberate, and systematic efforts to push Afghan women and girls out of the public sphere,” she added.\\nThe restrictions, especially the bans on education and NGO work, have drawn fierce international condemnation. But the Taliban have shown no signs of backing down, claiming the bans are temporary suspensions in place allegedly because women were not wearing the Islamic headscarf, or hijab, correctly and because gender segregation rules were not being followed.\\nAs for the ban on university education, the Taliban government has said that some of the subjects being taught were not in line with Afghan and Islamic values.\\n“Confining half of the country’s population to their homes in one of the world’s largest humanitarian and economic crises is a colossal act of national self-harm,” Otunbayeva said.\\n“It will condemn not only women and girls, but all Afghans, to poverty and aid-dependency for generations to come,” she warned. “It will further isolate Afghanistan from its own citizens and from the rest of the world.”\\nAt a carpet factory in Kabul, women who were former government employees or high school and university students now spend their days weaving carpets.\\n“We all live like prisoners, we feel that we are caught in a cage,” said Hafiza, 22, who goes only by her first name and who used to be a first-year law student before the Taliban banned women from attending classes at her university. “The worst situation is when your dreams are shattered, and you are punished for being a woman.”\\nAnother worker at the factory, 18-years-old Shahida, who also uses only one name, said she was in 10th grade at one of Kabul high schools when her education was cut short.\\n“We just demand from the (Taliban) government to reopen schools and educational centers for us and give us our rights,” she said.\\nAn Afghan women’s rights campaigner, Zubaida Akbar, told the Security Council that since the Taliban seized power “the rights of Afghan women and girls have been decimated through over 40 decrees.”\\n“The Taliban have sought not only to erase women from public life, but to extinguish our basic humanity,” said Zubaida, who spoke on behalf of the rights group Freedom Now that deals with 20 mostly women-led grassroots movements inside Afghanistan. “There is one term that appropriately describes the situation of Afghan woman today — gender apartheid.”\\nAlison Davidian, the special representative for UN Women in Afghanistan, said: “The implications of the harm the Taliban are inflicting on their own citizens goes beyond women and girls.”\\nNo officials from the Taliban-led government were available for comment.\\nAt the Security Council, the U.N.’s Otunbayeva said there is a faction in the Taliban that doesn’t agree with the crackdown on women and girls and understands that attention must be paid to the real needs of all Afghans.\\n“Perhaps it can eventually execute a change of direction,” she said. “But time is running short. Global crises are multiplying. Demands on donor resources are multiplying as the availability of those resources diminishes.”\\nAhead of Thursday’s observances of International Women’s Day, about 200 Afghan female small business owners put together an exhibition of their products in Kabul. Most complained of losing business since the Taliban takeover.\\n“I don’t expect Taliban to respect women’s rights,” said one of them, Tamkin Rahimi. “Women here cannot practice (their) rights and celebrate Women’s Day, because we cannot go to school, university or go to work, so I think we don’t have any day to celebrate.”\\nTen of the 15 Security Council members issued a joint statement demanding that the Taliban immediately reverse all its oppressive measures against women and girls.\\n“Recovery in Afghanistan cannot happen without women’s full, equal and meaningful participation in all aspects of political, economic and social life,” said the statement by Albania, Brazil, Ecuador, France, Gabon, Japan, Malta, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe pro-business track record of the man poised to become China’s top economic official will make his term a test of whether he might moderate President Xi Jinping ’s tendency to intervene.\\nLi Qiang, 63, who is expected to be chosen China’s premier on Saturday, will have to grapple with a slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy, which is dealing with emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic, weak global demand for exports, lingering U.S. tariff hikes, a shrinking workforce and an aging population.\\nXi, who has bolstered the state sector, has said that he wants the ruling party to return to its “original mission” as China’s economic, social and cultural leader. That has been accompanied by tighter control over some industries, more aggressive censorship of TV and pop culture and the spread of a “social credit” system that penalizes the public for offenses ranging from fraud to littering. Xi took China’s most powerful role in 2012.\\nNow, observers are watching whether Li can roll out pragmatic policies during his five-year term. But the process of political decision-making in China is opaque, making analyzing the country’s direction a difficult matter for outsiders.\\nExpectations are based on Li’s performance as the party chief of the country’s largest city — Shanghai — and as the governor of neighboring Zhejiang province, a hub of small and mid-sized business. And, perhaps more importantly, his close ties with Xi.\\nLi was quoted as saying in a 2013 interview with respected business magazine Caixin that officials should ”put the government’s hands back in place, put away the restless hands, retract the overstretched hands.”\\nLi hailed Zhejiang’s businessmen as the most valuable resource in the province, pointing to e-commerce billionaire Jack Ma, and he highlighted his government’s cutting red tape.\\nIn contrast, Li has also strictly enforced some state controls, including rules meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19. When his local rule has been out of tune with national policies set by the president and his team, he has eventually fallen into step, seen as key to his rise.\\nUnder President Xi, entrepreneurs have been rattled not just by tighter political controls and anti-COVID curbs but more control over e-commerce and other tech companies. Anti-monopoly and data security crackdowns have wiped billions of dollars off companies’ stock-market value. Beijing is also pressing them to pay for social programs and official initiatives to develop processor chips and other technology.\\nA native of Zhejiang, Li studied agricultural mechanization and worked his way up the provincial party ranks. In 2003, he started an executive MBA program at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, common among ambitious party cadres.\\nPriscilla Lau, a former professor of the university and former Hong Kong delegate to China’s legislature, said Li attended her class on Hong Kong’s free-market economy for a chamber in the city and said he recalled her class when they met in Shanghai more than a decade later.\\n“It shows he’s very diligent,” Lau said.\\nLi’s working relationship with Xi began in the 2000s when the latter was appointed party chief in Zhejiang. Following Xi’s eventual move to Beijing and appointment as party general secretary, Li was promoted to Zhejiang governor in 2013, the No. 2 role in the provincial government.\\nThree years later, Li was appointed party chief of Jiangsu province, an economic powerhouse on the east coast of China, marking the first time he held a position outside his home province. In 2017, he was named party boss of Shanghai, a role held by Xi before the president stepped into China’s core leadership roles.\\nIn the commercial hub of Shanghai, Li continued to pursue pro-business policies. In 2018, electric car producer Tesla announced it would build its first factory outside the United States. It broke ground half a year later as the first wholly foreign-owned automaker in China. Even during the strict COVID lockdown in Shanghai last year, the factory managed to resume production after a roughly 20-day suspension, official news agency Xinhua reported.\\nTesla vice-president Tao Lin was quoted saying that several government departments had worked almost round-the-clock to help businesses resume work.\\n“The Shanghai government bent over backwards,” said Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, a Beijing-based advisory firm.\\nOn more complicated issues, not everything has been smooth sailing.\\nThough Li helped shepherd an agreement between Chinese and European companies to produce mRNA vaccines, Beijing was not in favor and the deal was put on hold, said Joerg Wuttke, the president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.\\nBefore the citywide lockdown, Li appeared to have more leeway to manage the financial hub’s smaller previous outbreaks than most other cities’ leaders did. Rather than sealing districts off, the government implemented limited lockdowns of housing compounds and workplaces.\\nWhen the highly contagious Omicron variant hit Shanghai, Li took a moderate approach until the central government stepped in and sealed off the city. The brutal two-month lockdown last spring confined 25 million people to their homes and severely disrupted the economy.\\nLi was named No. 2 in the ruling Communist Party in October when China’s president broke with past norms and awarded himself a third five-year term as general secretary.\\nUnlike most of his predecessors, Li has no government experience at the national level, and his reputation was dented by ruthless enforcement of the lengthy COVID-19 lockdown in the financial hub that was criticized as excessive.\\nHis expected appointment appears to indicate that an ability to win the trust of Xi, China’s most powerful figure in decades, is the key determinant when it comes to political advancement.\\nAs premier, Li faces a diminishing role for the State Council, China’s Cabinet, as Xi moves to absorb government powers into party bodies, believing the party should play a greater role in Chinese society. Still, some commentators believe he will be more trusted, and therefore more influential, than his predecessor, who was seen as a rival to Xi, not a protege.\\n“Xi Jinping does not have to worry about Li Qiang being a separate locus of power,” said Ho Pin, a veteran journalist and Chinese political observer. “Trust between them also allows Li Qiang to work more proactively and share his worries, and he will directly give Xi a lot of information and suggestions.”\\nIris Pang, ING’s chief China economist, sees Li mainly as a loyal enforcer of Xi’s will rather than a moderating influence.\\nLi was pro-business because he was required to be so in his previous government roles, Pang said.\\nHis key trait, she said, is his “strong execution.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0Is the United States out to sabotage China? Chinese leaders think so.\\nPresident Xi Jinping accused Washington this week of trying to isolate his country and hold back its development. That reflects the ruling Communist Party’s growing frustration that its pursuit of prosperity and global influence is threatened by U.S. restrictions on access to technology, its support for Taiwan and other moves seen by Beijing as hostile.\\nXi, China’s most powerful leader in decades, tries to appear to be above problems and usually makes blandly positive public comments. That made his complaint Monday all the more striking. Xi said a U.S.-led campaign of “containment and suppression” of China has “brought unprecedented, severe challenges.” He called on the public to “dare to fight.”\\nOn Tuesday, Foreign Minister Qin Gang sharpened the warning, saying Washington faces possible “conflict and confrontation” if it fails to change course.\\n“The foreign minister is speaking on behalf of a widely held view that the United States is coming after China and they have to defend themselves,” said John Delury, an international relations specialist at Yonsei University in Seoul.\\nChina is hardly the only government to fume at Washington’s dominance of global strategic and economic affairs. But Chinese leaders see the United States as making extra effort to thwart Beijing as a challenger for regional and possibly global leadership.\\nThe ruling party wants to restore China’s historic role as a political and cultural leader, raise incomes by transforming the country into an inventor of technology, and unite what it considers the Chinese motherland by taking control of Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy that Beijing claims as part of its territory.\\nBeijing sees those as positive goals, but American officials see them as threats. They say Chinese development plans are based at least in part on stealing or pressuring foreign companies to hand over technology. Some warn Chinese competition might erode U.S. industrial dominance and incomes.\\nWashington has set back Beijing’s plans by putting Chinese companies including its first global tech brand, Huawei, on a blacklist that limits access to processor chips and other technology. That crippled Huawei’s smartphone brand, once one of the world’s biggest. American officials are lobbying European and other allies to avoid Huawei equipment when they upgrade phone networks.\\nWashington cites security fears, but Beijing says that is an excuse to hurt its fledgling competitors.\\nThe two governments have the world’s biggest trading relationship and common interests in combating climate change and other problems. But relations are strained over Taiwan, Beijing’s treatment of Hong Kong and mostly Muslim ethnic minorities, and its refusal to criticize or isolate Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\\nThe official Chinese view has soured following an uptick when Xi met U.S. President Joe Biden in November in Indonesia, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations specialist at Renmin University in Beijing. He noted that in the five months since then, Washington approved more weapons sales to Taiwan, criticized Beijing’s stance on Ukraine and put more Chinese companies on export watchlists, all of which China saw as hostile.\\nXi and Qin spoke in a “dramatic way” this week, but “the essence of what they said is China’s long-term stance,” Shi said. The leadership believes “the United States has implemented almost all around, drastic and desperate containment of China in all respects, especially in strategic and military fields.”\\n“The risk of military conflict between China and the United States is getting bigger,” Shi said.\\nA State Department spokesperson, Ned Price, said Washington wants to “coexist responsibly” within the global trade and political system and denied the U.S. government wants to suppress China.\\n“This is not about containing China. This is not about suppressing China. This is not about holding China back,” Price said in Washington. “We want to have that constructive competition that is fair” and “doesn’t veer into that conflict.”\\nThe United States formed a strategic group, the Quad, with Japan, Australia and India in response to concern about China and its claim to vast tracts of sea that are busy shipping lanes. They insist the group doesn’t focus on any one country, but its official statements are about territorial claims and other issues on which they have disputes with Beijing.\\nThe latest change in tone follows acrimonious exchanges over a Chinese balloon that was shot down after passing over North America. Its electronics and other equipment are being examined by the FBI.\\nQin, the foreign minister is “trying to position China as a global force for moderation and for peace” in front of foreign audiences and say “it’s the Americans who are blowing things out of proportion,” Delury said.\\nXi’s government is especially irritated by displays of support by American and other Western legislators for Taiwan, which split with China in 1949 after a civil war.\\nTaiwan never has been part of the People’s Republic of China, but the Communist Party says the island of 22 million people must unite with the mainland, by force if necessary.\\nWashington is obligated by federal law to see that Taiwan has the weapons to defend itself and has sold it fighter jets and missiles. Chinese leaders complain that encourages Taiwanese politicians who might want to resist unification and possibly declare formal independence, a step Beijing says would lead to war.\\nPremier Li Keqiang, who is due to step down as China’s No. 2 leader this month, called on Sunday for “peaceful reunification.” But Xi’s government also has stepped up efforts to intimidate the island by flying fighter jets and firing missiles into the sea nearby.\\nThe latest downturn is “testament to the real degradation” of U.S.-Chinese relations, which “never had much trust,” said Drew Thompson, a fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.\\nChinese leaders “consider any sort of discussion on strategic issues as sensitive and out of bounds,” which leads to “heightened risk of miscalculation,” Thompson said.\\n“They believe the U.S. is a hegemon that seeks to undermine the Communist Party and its legitimacy, and they have ample evidence of that,” he said. “But should perceptions and the balance of interests change, they could just as easily believe the U.S. is a partner for achieving the party’s objectives.”\\n',\n",

And then, sometimes, you get your job back — if you want it.\\nHaraldur Thorleifsson, who until recently was employed at Twitter, logged in to his computer last Sunday to do some work — only to find himself locked out, along with 200 others.\\nHe might have figured, as others before him have in the chaotic months of layoffs and firings since Elon Musk took over the company, that he was out of a job.\\nInstead, after nine days of no answer from Twitter as to whether or not he was still employed, Thorleifsson decided to tweet at Musk to see if he could catch the billionaire’s attention and get an answer to his Schrödinger’s job situation.\\n“Maybe if enough people retweet you’ll answer me here?” he wrote on Monday.\\nEventually, he got his answer after a surreal Twitter exchange with Musk, who proceeded to quiz him about his work, question his disability and need for accommodations (Thorleifsson, who goes by “Halli,” has muscular dystrophy and uses a wheelchair) and tweet that Thorleifsson has a “prominent, active Twitter account and is wealthy” and the “reason he confronted me in public was to get a big payout.” While the exchange was going on, Thorleifsson said he received an email that he was no longer employed.\\nLate Tuesday afternoon, however, Musk had a change of heart.\\n“I would like to apologize to Halli for my misunderstanding of his situation. It was based on things I was told that were untrue or, in some cases, true, but not meaningful,” he tweeted. “He is considering remaining at Twitter.”\\nThorleifsson did not immediately respond to a message for comment following Musk’s tweet. In an earlier email, he called the experience “surreal.”\\n“You had every right to lay me off. But it would have been nice to let me know!” he tweeted to Musk.\\nThorleifsson, who lives in Iceland, has about 151,000 Twitter followers (Musk has over 130 million). He joined Twitter in 2021, when the company, under the prior management, acquired his startup Ueno.\\nHe was lauded in Icelandic media for choosing to receive the purchase price in wages rather than a lump sum payout. That’s because this way, he would pay higher taxes to Iceland in support of its social services and safety net.\\nThorleifsson’s next move: “I’m opening a restaurant in downtown Reykjavik very soon,” he tweeted. “It’s named after my mom.”\\nTwitter did not immediately respond to a message for comment.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un warned Tuesday that the country is ready to take “quick, overwhelming action” against the United States and South Korea, as the allies expand their regular military drills.\\nKim Yo Jong’s statement came a day after the United States flew a nuclear-capable B-52 bomber to the Korean Peninsula for a joint drill with South Korean warplanes. The U.S. and South Korean militaries are also preparing to revive their largest field exercises later this month.\\n“We keep our eye on the restless military moves by the U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet military and are always on standby to take appropriate, quick and overwhelming action at any time according to our judgment,” Kim Yo Jong said in a statement carried by state media.\\nShe didn’t elaborate on any planned actions, but North Korea has often performed missile tests in response to U.S.-South Korean military drills because it views them as an invasion rehearsal.\\n“The demonstrative military moves and all sorts of rhetoric by the U.S. and South Korea, which go so extremely frantic as not to be overlooked, undoubtedly provide (North Korea) with conditions for being forced to do something to cope with them,” she said.\\nMonday’s flyover of the B-52 bomber was the latest in a series of U.S.-South Korean aerial exercises involving powerful U.S. aircraft. The U.S. deployed a long-range U.S. B-1B bomber or multiple B-1Bs to the peninsula a few times earlier this year. South Korea said those drills demonstrated the allies’ ability to make a decisive response to potential North Korean aggressions.\\nLast Friday, the South Korean and U.S. militaries announced they would conduct a computer-simulated command post training from March 13-23 and restore their largest springtime field exercises that were last held in 2018.\\nThe allies had canceled or scaled back some of their regular drills since 2018 to support now-dormant diplomacy with North Korea and guard against the COVID-19 pandemic. But they’ve been restoring their exercises after North Korea last year conducted a record number of missile tests and openly threatened to use its nuclear weapons in potential conflicts with its rivals.\\nIn a separate statement Tuesday, North Korea’s Foreign Ministry called the flyover of the U.S. B-52 bomber a reckless provocation that pushes the situation on the peninsula “deeper into the bottomless quagmire.” The statement, attributed to the unnamed head of the ministry’s foreign news office, said “there is no guarantee that there will be no violent physical conflict” if U.S.-South Korean military provocations continue.\\nNorth Korea often unleashes fiery rhetoric in times of heightened animosities with the United States and South Korea. Possible steps North Korea could take include a nuclear test or the launch of a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile targeting the mainland U.S., observers say.\\nLast month, Kim Yo Jong threatened to turn the Pacific into the North’s firing range. In her statement Tuesday, she said North Korea would consider a possible U.S. attempt to intercept a North Korean ICBM a declaration of war. She cited a South Korean media report saying the U.S. military plans to shoot down a North Korean ICBM if it’s test-launched toward the Pacific.\\nAll known North Korean ICBM tests have been made at steep angles to avoid neighboring countries, and the weapons landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nSoldiers in Myanmar rampaged through several villages, raping, beheading and killing at least 17 people, residents said, in the latest of what critics of the ruling military say are a series of war crimes since the army seized power two years ago.\\nThe bodies of 17 people were recovered last week in the villages of Nyaung Yin and Tar Taing — also called Tatai — in Sagaing region in central Myanmar, according to members of the anti-government resistance and a resident who lost his wife. They said the victims had been detained by the military and in some cases appeared to have been tortured before being killed.\\nMyanmar has been in turmoil since the military’s February 2021 seizure of power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi prompted nationwide peaceful protests that security forces suppressed with deadly force. The violence triggered widespread armed resistance, which has since turned into what some U.N. experts have characterized as a civil war.\\nThe army has been conducting major offensives in the countryside, including burning villages and driving hundreds of thousands of people from their homes. It has faced some of its toughest resistance in Sagaing, in Myanmar’s historic heartland.\\nThe soldiers involved in last week’s attacks were in a group of more than 90 who were brought to the area by five helicopters on Feb. 23, said local leaders of the pro-democracy People’s Defense Forces and independent Myanmar media.\\nThey said the bodies of 14 people, including three women, were found Thursday on a small island in a river in Nyaung Yin. Three more male victims were found in Tar Taing, including two members of the local resistance. One of the two was dismembered, with his head cut off, they said.\\nThe neighboring villages are about 45 kilometers (28 miles) west of the major city of Mandalay.\\nTar Taing resident Moe Kyaw, 42, survived the attack but said his 39-year-old wife, Pan Thwal, and 18-year-old nephew were among those killed. Contacted by phone, he said Friday they were among 70 villagers detained in the middle of the night last Wednesday by soldiers who shot into the air as they herded their captives from their homes to the local Buddhist monastery.\\nMoe Kyaw said the soldiers stole beer and other items from his aunt’s small shop, and as they beat her, he fled for his life, escaping two soldiers who shot at him.\\nHe said his wife and other villagers were tortured at the monastery and then taken away from the village, apparently as hostages against any attack. He said his wife and two other women were beaten, raped and shot dead on Thursday by the soldiers, who also took his spouse’s earrings, His two sons, 9 and 11 years old, were released when the soldiers departed, he said.\\nMoe Kyaw did not explain how he knew the details about his wife’s treatment.\\nMyanmar’s underground National Unity Government — the main organization opposed to military rule that describes itself as the country’s legitimate government — said in an online news conference on Monday that the soldiers were from the 99th Light Infantry Division based in Mandalay Region.\\nA leader of a Sagaing resistance group called the Demon King Defense Force said his group attacked the better-armed government troops on Wednesday in a failed effort to rescue the detained villagers.\\nWhen they went Thursday morning to the small island where the soldiers had taken about 20 villagers they found 14 bodies in three spots, said the resistance leader, who asked not to be identified because of fear of reprisals by the military.\\nAcknowledging that he had not seen the killings, he said he also believed the women had been raped.\\nIn an earlier incident apparently involving the same army unit, two boys aged 12 and 13 assisting the People’s Defense Force were captured by government troops on Feb. 26 and beheaded after being forced to show the locations of their camps, according to independent Myanmar media. Photos said to be of their bodies, found at Kan Daw village, about 12 kilometers (7 miles) northwest of Tar Taing, were circulated on social media.\\nA separate group, the Sadaung Lighting People’s Defense Force, has said that two of its older teenage members were also killed and beheaded in fighting at Kan Daw on the same day.\\nThe military government has not responded to the allegations. In the past, it has denied documented abuses and said that casualties occurred in the course of fighting against armed anti-government guerrillas. Online media supportive of the military government have made the same claim about the recent incidents in Sagaing or suggested that they were the result of factional fighting within the resistance.\\nMyanmar’s military has long been accused of serious human rights violations, most notably in the western state of Rakhine. International courts are considering whether it committed genocide there in a brutal 2017 counterinsurgency campaign that caused more than 700,000 members of the Muslim Rohingya minority to flee to neighboring Bangladesh for safety.\\nLast week, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk accused the ruling generals of carrying out “a scorched earth policy in an attempt to stamp out opposition.”\\nHis agency said credible sources have verified the deaths of at least 2,940 civilians and 17,572 arrests by the military and its allies since the 2021 takeover.\\n',\n",

In addition, the revision process should ensure adequate consultation with conflict victims about the content of the proposed legislation.”\\nThe statement quotes Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for South Asia Dinushika Dissanayake as saying that key provisions of the bill appear to be designed to shield alleged perpetrators from prosecution for some of the most serious crimes under international law. “If it is rushed through parliament without significant changes, it cannot be the basis for a process that has the support of conflict victims, nor legal credibility at home or abroad.”\\nThe statement points that both the Maoist armed group and government security forces committed serious human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law amounting to crimes under international law during the armed conflict in Nepal from 1996 to 2006. It concedes that some aspects of the current bill can be the basis for progress, which is long overdue and desperately needed.\\n“However, if adopted as currently formulated, the bill would allow many people allegedly responsible for abuses amounting to crimes under international law to evade justice,” it warns. “It would result in the Nepali justice system continuing to abandon many victims and survivors, some of whom have waited two decades for truth and redress.”\\nThe statement has said that the bill gives rise to other serious human rights concerns and listed them as follows:\\r\\nit fails to establish a special investigation unit to collect evidence. Investigation units with expertise in human rights violations would help ensure that investigations are prompt, thorough and effective, in accordance with international human rights law and standards, and that victims can access effective remedies;\\r\\nit fails to clarify how the principle of non-retroactivity of criminal law would apply in a manner consistent with international law. International law requires the prosecution of certain serious crimes, such as torture and enforced disappearance, if warranted by evidence, irrespective of whether they were crimes under domestic law when they were committed; \\xa0\\r\\nit fails to clarify which ‘applicable law’ would be used to prosecute those involved in serious crimes. The Penal Code, which came into force in 2018, prevents retroactive applicability of its provisions. Moreover, the Penal Code includes statutory limitations for the crimes of rape, torture and enforced disappearances;\\r\\nit empowers the government to appoint judges on the special court “in consultation with the Judicial Council”, as opposed to through the independent process required by Nepal’s Constitution.\\r\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

Therefore, the country’s security will be strengthened in the long-term if the system is created such that it cannot be misused.

If the Prachanda government taps Oli’s phone because it feels Oli poses a threat to national security, then those details should be made public after four years or within a specified period even if Oli is not tried for treason,” Kharel said.\\nThere should be a provision of public disclosure for making public how many people’s phones were tapped during the four-year period, who did not face legal action, who was the officer to order the tapping, and who tapped the phones, he added.\\nKharel said telephone tapping would be misused in the absence of such a provision.\\nSenior advocate Radheshyam Adhikari says acts such as telephone recording should be carried out only with the court’s permission.\\n“What we’re saying is let the state carry out tapping with the court’s permission if investigation about me, Radheshyam Adhikari, is necessary. Let there be tapping if the government finds my activities objectionable, but there should be a trustworthy body to get permission for it,” Adhikari said. “We should not confine the state to such an extent that it cannot function.”\\nThe draft prepared by the government also includes many provisions that are in the National Civil Code and the Criminal Code.\\nThe draft has provisions of fining Rs 500,000 to Rs 2.5 million for slandering, threatening or causing unnecessary trouble through telecommunication mediums. The National Civil Code and the Criminal Code also include provisions of action against slander, libel and harassment through telephone.\\nThe government has claimed that there are no problems with the provisions included in the bill.\\nNetra Prasad Subedi, spokesperson for the Ministry of Information and Communication, said the issue of recording telephone conversations for crime investigation purposes is not inappropriate.\\n“The draft has been prepared, it is necessary to introduce a new act instead of the one from 1997,” Subedi said. “Details will be sought if investigation is necessary. The draft has been prepared so as to make them available during that time.”\\nSubedi said the draft is still under discussion. “It has not been finalized. We have received the Cabinet's consent in principle. I went through it again, I think there are no objectionable issues.”\\n“The ministry will now give [it] final shape and register [it] in the Parliament Secretariat,” he said.\\nAfter the government registers the bill in Parliament, lawmakers will discuss it and propose amendments.

Many of them left the cantonments and UNMIN ruled 19,602 of them eligible to be counted as combatants while 4,008 did not qualify to be counted as combatants.\\nThe Nepal Army took charge of the Maoist combatants in April 2012 while agreement for integrating the Maoist combatants into the Nepal Army was reached on November 1, 2012.\\nA total of 15,630 Maoist combatants, however, opted for voluntary retirement and returned home with Rs 500,000-800,000 while 1,422 were integrated in the Nepal Army. The state spent around Rs 20 billion for running the cantonments, integration of the combatants and payment for those who chose voluntary retirement.\\nThere were demands that the Maoist child soldiers who were disqualified during the verification process be compensated by the government at that time while many opined that those deemed disqualified need not be paid with the taxpayers’ money.\\nThe then Baburam Bhattarai government on October 21, 2012 had decided to pay Rs 200,000 to each of those disqualified combatants. But the Supreme Court (SC) was moved against the decision and the government could not dole out the money.\\nThe then KP Sharma Oli government had allocated Rs 840 million to pay Rs 200,000 each to the disqualified combatants and those who had opted for voluntary retirement but had not received the lump sum in the budget for the fiscal year 2073/74.\\nBishnu Paudel was the finance minister in the coalition government including CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) then. NC lawmakers and conflict victims had moved the SC against the decision and a short-term order by the single bench of Justice Gopal Parajuli had stopped that.\\nThe current government has again decided to pay the disqualified combatants when Maoist Chairman Dahal is the prime minister (PM) and oversees 16 ministries.\\nMaoist General Secretary Dev Gurung pointed that the past governments had also taken the decision and added that the current government is preparing to provide relief by formulating working procedure as the SC had instructed to pay them only after preparing working procedure. “The current government is preparing working procedure as money cannot be paid from the treasury without working procedure. The previous governments had also taken decision to pay money,” Gurung stated. “Those who were expelled after being labeled disqualified were deprived of relief. The government is trying to address them now.” \\xa0\\nUML leader and member of the then the all-party Special Committee for the Supervision, Integration and Rehabilitation of Maoist combatants Dipak Prakash Bhatta said that it was natural for the combatants who were deemed disqualified due to age, shorter experience, or even inability to provide satisfactory answers to the questions asked to be compensated by the state now. “The state and specially Maoists had made them participate in the conflict yesterday. But they were not verified as combatants mostly due to underage. The state or the Maoists should have addressed them then only. But it is not yet clear which body will look for them now, how they will be searched now.”\\nNepali Congress (NC) leader Minendra Rijal said that the recent decisions of the government led by Maoist Chairman Dahal including giving public holiday to mark the ‘People’s War’ Day, declaring martyrs and paying the disqualified combatants seem to be outside the spirit of 12-point deal, and the comprehensive peace agreement.\\nHe has stated that such politics can unravel the current ruling coalition formed with commitment to continue it for five years. “It is our duty to remind Dahal to not indulge in such politics. This will bring difficulties.”\\nHe has also added that Dahal does not seem to understand the gravity of the problems in the economy now. “It is not just the money to be given to disqualified combatants and families of martyrs, but the more important issue is the current government and PM do not seem to be serious about the problems facing the economy.” \\xa0\\nFormer disqualified combatant Lenin Bista said they were child soldiers and cannot be termed disqualified. “The government will provide relief for the child soldiers who were younger than 18 years then. They cannot be called disqualified combatants,” he has stressed. “We had put demands for education, health and demanded we be provided scholarship for education, the government invest on us by providing guarantee and other demands (sic). But the government said it will provide Rs 200,000 each. But it has not given in 10 years. This concept of giving money is wrong. This is an excuse for the party to claim that it has addressed the child soldiers.”\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nA portion of child care homes (CCHs) (9.7%) operational in Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali provinces are reported to have been operating without compliance with the Act Relating to Children (2018), the Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2007, and the Standards for the Operation and Management of Residential Child Care Homes (2009).\\nA study by the Center for Legal Research and Resource Development (CeLRRd) in coordination with the J/TIP Project supported by the US Department of State, the ECPAT Luxembourg, the National Child Rights Council (NCRC) and the Shakti Samuha said 90.3 % of CCHs in the three provinces are operating in compliance with the two acts and the standards.\\xa0\\nContrary to this, the participants of the focused group discussions comprising representatives from civil society organizations, most of them working on child rights believed that the CCHs surveyed lacked sufficient knowledge and information about their operation in accordance with the existing laws, rules and the standards.\\xa0\\xa0\\nThere is a huge gap between working modalities by CCHs and existing Child Protection and Human Trafficking Laws. Some of them are found to have forcibly separated children from their parents and forced into CCHs, said the lead researcher Kapil Aryal. According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the family is the fundamental unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and wellbeing of all its members, particularly children. It discourages the separation of children from their families against their will.\\xa0\\nSimilarly, there was a gap between the formulation and adoption of operational and child safe guarding policies by CCHs.\\nOnly slightly more than a quarter of the respondents (28.1%) said they had come up with a child protection policy, and employee administration rules (19.5%), financial administration rules (18.2%), periodic strategy and action plan of the organization (17.7%), gender and social inclusion policy (9.5%) and other documents (7%).\\nA lack of proper care, accommodation, hygienic food, good health, sanitation, children being deprived of communicating with their relatives were some of the problems facing children living in CCHs, said Aryal.\\nMost of the CCHs surveyed were being run in rented homes that are not designed for CCH. Similarly, most of them lacked separate floors and toilets for boys and girls, and open space for children to play.\\nSlightly more than three-quarters of the respondents (76.7%) reported that they had either a separate flat or building for boys and girls. Some of the surveyed CCHs were providing food more than three times a day (78%) or three times a day (20%). But, some of them had compromised on the quality of food, health and education being offered to the children, according to the study.\\nThe Constitution of Nepal (2015) guarantees basic rights to children. These rights include the right to name and birth registration as well as the right to identity, the right to education, health, maintenance, proper care, sports, entertainment and overall personality development from families and the state. Similarly, it guarantees their right to elementary child development and child participation, and against all forms of abuses and exploitation.\\nA lack of timely monitoring and coordination among the monitoring bodies and overlapping in terms of the nature and frequency of monitoring has also made matters worse.\\nThe respondents reported inconsistency in monitoring. A majority of them (61.1%) responded that monitoring was carried out every six months to one year, while 18.1% said monitoring took place every 3-6 months. A sizable number of them (15.3%) said monitoring took place without notice and irregularly.\\nAssessment of children and their families should be in practice for any CCH before admitting children. But, some of the surveyed CCHs lacked it. A notable number of CCHs (10.4%) did not have any policy that guides the requirements and procedures for admitting children.\\nUnderstaffing and a lack of proper training for workers in CCHs have also added to the problems. Some of the surveyed CCHs heavily suffered due to a workforce crunch, he said, adding that some of them were operating without registration. Putting CCHs, transit homes and shelter homes into the same basket is not justifiable. They are in fact of different kinds and they need separate guidelines, laws and rules for operation, he said, opining that operating them through the same guidelines may prove a wrong decision.\\n\\xa0According to a report published in 2020 by the NCRC, there were a total of 489 child care homes in 45 districts across the country where around 11,350 children were living. The Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report by the US Department of State, said most of these children living in CCHs had at least one living parent.\\nFor the research, a total of 796 children from 77 CCHs from 82 different districts in 20 local levels of 11 districts in Bagmati, Gandaki and Karnali provinces were studied. The top ten districts representing these children in the CCHs were from Kavrepalanchok (44), Sindhupalchok (43), Makawanpur (41), Dhading (40), Chitwan (38), Kathmandu (38), Humla (37), Nuwakot (36), Jumla (28) and Gorkha (27).

       "  '\\n                            Researchers using digital technology deciphered the writing on two pages of Anne Frank’s diary that she had pasted over with brown masking paper, discovering four naughty jokes and a candid explanation of sex, contraception and prostitution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Anyone who reads the passages that have now been discovered will be unable to suppress a smile,” said Frank van Vree, director of the Netherlands Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies. “The ‘dirty’ jokes are classics among growing children. They make it clear that Anne, with all her gifts, was above all also an ordinary girl.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne, age 13 at the time, wrote the two pages on Sept. 28, 1942, less than three months after she, her family and another Jewish family went into hiding from the Nazis in a secret annex behind a canal-side house in Amsterdam.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater on, possibly fearing prying eyes or no longer liking what she had written, she covered them over with brown paper with an adhesive backing like a postage stamp, and their content remained a tantalizing mystery for decades.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt turns out the pages contained four jokes about sex that Anne herself described as “dirty” and an explanation of women’s sexual development, sex, contraception and prostitution.\\r\\n\\r\\n“They bring us even closer to the girl and the writer Anne Frank,” Ronald Leopold, executive director of the Anne Frank House museum, said Tuesday.\\r\\n\\r\\nExperts on Anne’s multimillion-selling diary said the newly discovered text, when studied with the rest of her journal, reveals more about her development as a writer than it does about her interest in sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne wrote candidly in other parts of her diary about her burgeoning sexuality, her anatomy and her impending period. Those passages were censored by her father before the diary was first published in 1947 but became available in more recent unabridged editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeopold said the newly deciphered material provides an early example of how Anne “creates a fictional situation that makes it easier for her to address the sensitive topics that she writes about.” In her diary, for example, she addressed entries to a fictional friend named Kitty.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe institutions involved in the latest research said that because of copyright issues, it is unclear whether the passages will be incorporated into new editions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe deciphering was done by researchers from the Anne Frank museum, the Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies and the Huygens Institute of Netherlands History.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey photographed the pages, backlit by a flash, and then used image-processing software to decipher the words, which were hard to read because they were jumbled up with the writing on the reverse sides of the pages.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the passage on sex, Anne described how a young woman gets her period around age 14, saying that it is “a sign that she is ripe to have relations with a man but one doesn’t do that of course before one is married.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn prostitution, she wrote: “All men, if they are normal, go with women, women like that accost them on the street and then they go together. In Paris they have big houses for that. Papa has been there.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of her jokes was this: “Do you know why the German Wehrmacht girls are in Holland? As mattresses for the soldiers.”\\r\\n\\r\\nShe also related this joke: “A man had a very ugly wife and he didn’t want to have relations with her. One evening he came home and then he saw his friend in bed with his wife, then the man said: ‘He gets to and I have to!!!’”\\r\\n\\r\\nAnne wrote her diary while she and her family hid for more than two years during World War II. The family went into hiding in July 1942 and remained there, provided with food and other essentials by a close-knit group of helpers, until Aug. 4, 1944, when they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz.\\r\\n\\r\\nOnly Anne’s father, Otto Frank, survived the war. Anne and her sister died in Bergen-Belsen camp. Anne was 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the war, Otto Frank had his daughter’s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam’s most popular tourist attractions.\\n',\n",

It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.\\nPelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.\\n',\n",

Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations.

Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president?

       "  \"\\n                            Polities in Nepal thawed and metamorphosed at certain intervals. In the process, the country changed democratic contours several times along with delineation of their purposes at least as the constitutional stipulations. Political parties that consider power as meaning of politics did cause the alterations. However, neighborly geopolitical realities and the role of the distantly located power centers capable of shaping politico-economic world order equally interplayed for the changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical experience has it that stakeholders have failed every now and then to consolidate a politico-administrative authority that can irreversibly promote democratic practice. Even the achievements hyped as epochal breakthroughs were undone several times either stalling or resulting in the loss of democratic gains. The situations, in the past, drifted the country toward chaos, if not to the brink of state failure for some outsiders.\\r\\n\\r\\nReclaimed from prolonged armed conflict and the subsequent shaky political transition to peace, the country has adopted democratic republicanism and has successfully held three levels of elections thereafter. As a result, a powerful government, arithmetically and unprecedentedly as well, is in place. To the public, no government hitherto formed was as powerful and efficient as the current one is. Popular views converge that union of the communist parties of the past following the elections has added to the strength to safeguard and strengthen the constitutional and federal arrangements. The onus of unfurling economic dialogue and achievements leaving the political one behind should be shouldered by this government.\\r\\n\\r\\nParadoxically however, current union of political entities and the subsequent formation of government, based on the incumbent government's initial modus operandi and budgeted programs, is feared to gradually tighten administrative screws against democratic processes and institutions. The foundation for this possibility, however, was strategically created specifically following the promulgation of constitution. Undue politicization of police institution, explicit political influence on judiciary, 'revolutionary' and discretionary move to weaken organized service-providers being guided more by political interest to dissolve the organizations and committees, imbalanced and centralized allocation of budget, blanket disregard to human rights based approach to governance and civil voices, reluctance to acknowledge inclusion that are all against the spirit of current polity. Moreover, the acts are catalytic to expand the breeding ground for repressive political establishment that reverses the current polity.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, cynics recall the past record of the current prime minister vis-à-vis perception of democracy. His distaste and disbelief against liberal democracy and republicanism expressed before mass movement for republicanism, and also the expressions he had against inclusion and regional equality had clearly indicated at his discomforts with the secular and federal set up. His acts and expressions, especially during post-constitution-promulgation and pre-election periods, were believed to have intended to underplay the core spirit of the constitution especially inclusion, liberalism, human rights and political pluralism. He, at that time, sounded like he was a supporter of an attempt to diverting the public sentiments toward a false orientation that either the emergence of a Panchayat-era totalitarian deified figure could cement the national unity or tread the fast track of development of the nation or that consolidation of an authoritarian communist polity could have the capacity toward this end.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe calls especially the latter swayed citizenry amid heightened political fluidity that only a new political juggernaut could knit up the disoriented regional, ethnic and other interest groups for the national order. Communist coalition was forged for the election purpose. Such a coalition was perceived by the ordinary citizens as their hope whereas the intricacies and the power-centric shrewdness of the stakeholders of the alliance were not fathomable for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has not been that long since we constitutionally embarked on federal mode of state operation, hence it is not unnatural that we could face attempts to create disillusionment over the liberal system. It is more so if national consciousness and consensus on such the system is in the making or toward reversal. The current constitution that defines the country as federal democratic republic with policies and some stipulations toward socialist orientation was an agreement between leftist and the centrist political groups. The communist coalition basically formed for election purpose and the current union, one of the constituents of which is a group that took sledgehammer to democracy in the past heralding a war for the establishment of communism, is all set to shepherd the democratic republican agendas with almost no stake of other political stakeholders in the parliament and the government. This poses a million dollar question: can unprecedentedly elected majoritarian communist government that inherits illiberal DNA be the promoter of current political arrangement of the country?\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical stasis regulated by periodic elections is precondition for democratic evolution. However, what should be moving is economy and society. There have been many examples that economic growths lead toward democracy but ours is the case whereby acting to live up with the expectation of faster economic growth under nascent federal democracy is a national need. How the current government succeeds depends on how prudently it can deliver economic growth under democratic processes and mold.\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil couple of decades ago, politics guided by the ideal philosophies of left and right divisions was mis/used for rabble-rousing as politicians at that time did not have access to the meager national coffer. In the recent years, politics has turned out to be a pursuit of direct financial gains for all political parties and groups. \\xa0It is based on the gains amassed out of state machineries, corporate spheres and even from civil society activism that they can ensure more votes in the polls. The elections we had recently were not exception in this regard. Striving to accumulate money by hook or by crook for running elections and to act toward recovering the expenditure after getting elected, if for the next election has been a norm among politicians now. This tendency is unlikely to holistically promote economy. Rather, a chunk of politicians and the cadres around them are likely to turn out to be nouveau riche in short span of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowering among the public as a magnificent politician by painting an unsubstantiated rosy future of a country, forgetting even the central promises made during election campaigns and getting impugned by them as an outright liar was a practice during the last 28 years that saw 26 governments. The sitting prime minister, hopefully, will not follow suit: the question again is – whether or not the current PM and his entire team are interested to be an exception in this regard. Following suit is to tread the path already covered by the Nepali Congress. The path was known for messy management, internal rivalry among leaders, blame that kings-era industrial bases were torpedoed due to the Congress adopted policies and governance, total dependence on southern neighbor, failure to devise state machinery in line with the emerging public interests and contemporary needs, lack of clear take on the foreign policy, among others. Unfair practices sidelined a number of persons with potentials despite their caliber and proactive engagement ultimately making them turn passive or compelling to wade waist-deep into the morass corrupt leaders had created. There had been a yawning divide between public expectation and the party's modus operandi. For them nationalism, democracy and socialism was a political maxim however there had never been an attempt toward translating the philosophy into everyday life of the public. Rather, it kept on barking up the wrong tree that anti-communist public appeal could sustain their perennial existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow NC is not and will not be in power for at least some years unless a political miracle occurs. However, current government has a big mountain before them. Corruption, managerial inefficiencies, over-politicization of the state machinery, unprecedented erosion of public academic institutions including leading universities of the country, lucrative trade of health and education concerns, and also the promises the parties in government made in elections have been teasing the government. Addressing them well will only justify the landslide electoral victory and the grandiose call for nationalism and economic achievements. If undelivered, the vicious cycle will continue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe writer works for civil society movement and the views expressed in this article are his own so do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of any organization/s he works for or is affiliated to. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\n                            On 29 May 2018, Finance Minister Yuba Raj Khatiwada presented FY2019 budget (mid-July 2018 to mid-July 2019) to a joint session of the federal parliament. The budget is more or less in line with the left alliance’s policies and program approved by the parliament, and touches upon some of its distributive as well as pet projects mentioned in their election manifesto. As per the government, this budget and the targets set in it form the basis to evaluate the government’s progress in the coming years.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering this claim and the strong position of Communist Party of Nepal (CPN) at all three tiers of government— especially with respect to its ability to usher in transformative projects as well as reforms, and change the nature of budget making, it is a disappointment. That said, good things about the budget are that it focuses heavily on infrastructure development, plugging revenue leakages, and implementation of federalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe budget is unique in four ways:\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, for the first time, grants to provincial and local governments consist of revenue-sharing from as mandated by the constitution, NNRFC Act, and Intergovernmental Fiscal Management Act. The central government needs to share 30% of VAT and excise duty (15% each to local and provincial governments) mobilized in a given year. Similarly, it has to share 50% of royalties generated from natural resources (mountaineering, electricity, forests, mines and minerals). In addition, on expenditure side, it categorically allocates fiscal equalization and conditional as well as unconditional grants.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, compared to FY2018 budget, the total budget outlay is not increased by much given that the central government needed to share about 12% of projected revenue mobilization with provincial and local governments. This along with an outsized FY2018 budget bound the government’s hands. However, compared to FY2018 revised estimate, total budget outlay has been increased by 25.7%.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, it focuses on controlling revenue leakages, agricultural development, and infrastructure development, especially pushing forward with preparatory work for large-scale projects, development of sports facilities, hospitals and industrial estates. However, the finance minister has squandered an opportunity to change the course of budget-making, especially by including numerous pet projects that are of populist nature; allowing the parliamentarians to have a say over project selection (Rs40 million for each federal constituency), which makes them project managers rather than lawmakers; spreading grants and subsidies too thin across too many sectors; and not rolling out private-sector specific reforms or incentive measures. In effect, expenditure rationalization and fiscal prudence are mildly adhered to, but could deteriorate fast if revenue mobilization is below target.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, there is hardly any concrete reform plan to reinvigorate the private sector; a time-bound implementation framework is missing (usual MOF directives to speed up spending won’t cut it); and GDP and revenue growth targets are ambitious. The budget looks like a continuation of previous structure of budget, not a departure from it considering the high hopes people had from a technocrat finance minister with policy-making background\\r\\n\\r\\nMore on these later, but first let's look at the macroeconomic specifics:\\r\\n\\r\\nBudget outlay\\r\\n\\r\\nThe total expenditure outlay for FY2019 is Rs 1.3152 trillion (an estimated 38.7% of GDP), which is 25.7% higher than the revised expenditure estimate for FY2018. The government expects to spend 81.8% of Rs 1.279 trillion allocated—in others words, this is the revised estimate for FY2018.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe FY2019 outlay comprises of Rs 845.40 billion as recurrent expenditures (64.3% of the total outlay), Rs 314 billion as capital expenditures (23.9%), and Rs 155.70 billion as financial provision (11.8%). This pattern is pretty much the same as last year. The government has allocated Rs 151 billion for post-earthquake reconstruction.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nFY2019 budget overview\\n\\n\\nGDP growth target (%)\\n8\\n\\n\\n\\nInflation target (%)\\n6.5\\n\\n\\n\\nBudget allocation for FY2018\\nFY2019BE\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nRs billion\\n%\\n\\n\\nFederal budget\\n1315.2\\n\\n\\n\\nRecurrent\\n845.4\\n64.3\\n\\n\\nCapital\\n314.0\\n23.9\\n\\n\\nFinancial provision\\n155.7\\n11.8\\n\\n\\nFederal receipts\\n890.1\\n\\n\\n\\nRevenue\\n831.3\\n93.4\\n\\n\\nForeign grants\\n58.8\\n6.6\\n\\n\\nRevenue sharing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBudget surplus (+)/deficit (-)\\n-425.8\\n\\n\\n\\nFederal deficit financing\\n425.8\\n\\n\\n\\nForeign loans\\n253.8\\n59.6\\n\\n\\nDomestic borrowing\\n172.0\\n40.4\\n\\n\\n\\r\\nAs a share of GDP, total budget amounts to 38.7%, of which just 9.2% is allocated for capital spending. As per FY2018 revised estimates, the government now expects to spend just 87.1% of planned recurrent spending and 71.2% of planned capital spending. Compared to revised estimates, recurrent spending is increased by 20.8% and capital spending by 31.6%. However, compared to FY2018 budget allocation, this is opposite: capital spending is down by 6.3% but recurrent spending is up by 5.2%. This is consistent with the finance minister’s commitment that he will reduce allocation for some non-preforming projects (especially those projects that are not ready for implementation). However, he has given continuity, under different name, to wasteful programs such as the ones run by parliamentarians. May be party politics was too overwhelming for him to resist.\\r\\n\\r\\nRevenue\\r\\n\\r\\nA total revenue target of Rs 945.6 billion (27.8% of GDP) has been set for FY2019, including projected foreign grants of Rs 58.8 billion (1.7% of GDP). It also includes Rs 114.2 billion revenue sharing with provincial and local governments. The government will share, based on monthly collections, 30% of VAT and excise duty, and 50% of royalties from natural resources to subnational governments. The revised estimate for revenue mobilization (including grants) in FY2018 is 25.4% of GDP. Compared to the revised estimate, revenue growth target for FY2019 is 29.8%, which is ambitious and was achieved just once in the last decade. Given that the GDP growth target itself is overly ambitious, and revenue administration reforms along with tinkering of import tariff on some non-essential items have its limit in increasing import-based revenue, it needs to be seen how this government will achieve the revenue target.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically, in order to achieve the high revenue growth target, the finance minister is relying on: (i) increasing excise duty on alcohol and tobacco, and mandating VAT registration for sales within metropolitan and sub-metropolitan cities; (ii) increasing excise duty on motorcycles with engines bigger than 150 cc and four-wheelers with those above 1000 cc; (iii) increase internal taxes on sugary products and refrigerator production; (iv)\\xa0 income tax slabs of 10%, 20% and 30%, and an additional 20% tax on those earning above Rs 2 million annually; (v) revision of application of capital gains tax on real estate transaction (now transactions above one million— earlier it was three million—will be liable for capital gains tax); and (vi) revenue administration reforms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is some tax relief as well: no education and health services tax and VAT (in the case of private hospitals); tax concession for tourism and productive sectors on profit reinvestment, reduction of income tax by 50% on tea, clothing and dairy; seven year income tax holiday for woman-run businesses;\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal’s revenue mobilization is already one of the highest among low-income countries and about 45% of it comes from taxes on imports. Tax revenue is projected to be around 21.9% of GDP in FY2018 and 24.7% of GDP in FY2019.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\nDeficit financing\\r\\n\\r\\nConsidering federal expenditure and its share of revenue from total revenue mobilization, the budget deficit turns out to be Rs 425.80 billion, which is financed by foreign loans equivalent to Rs 253.80 billion and domestic borrowing of Rs 172 billion. This year the finance minister has done away with using last year’s estimated cash balance to finance expenditure. There was a tendency to bloat government savings (amount the government raised but could not spend) and use that to make a case for higher deficit financing in the previous years. The government is planning to increase net foreign borrowing by 24.7% to Rs 229.40 billion (6.8 of GDP) and net domestic borrowing by 9.6% to Rs 136.90 billion (4% of GDP). Overall, fiscal deficit is projected to be about 7.4% of GDP. Fiscal deficit is the difference between revenue including grants and expenditure including net lending.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is recurrent budget going?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 59% of planned recurrent expenditure of Rs 845.40 billion is going to provincial and local governments in the form of fiscal transfer (fiscal equalization and conditional grants) and unconditional grants. This is where the pet projects of politicians are usually embedded in as these grants are to cover both recurrent and capital spending at subnational level. The other big ticket item is the compensation of employees, which takes up about 13.9% of total recurrent budget. The government has earmarked Rs 113.10 billion for social security spending and Rs 86.80 billion for use of goods and services. Compared to the revised estimates, the largest increase is in social security, which together with subsidies was one of the highlights of the left alliance’s election manifesto.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is capital budget going?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost 54.2% of the planned capital budget of Rs 314 billion is going for civil works, 22.3% for constructing building, and 32.2% for land. Compared to the FY2018 revised estimates, capital spending has been increased by 31.6%, but compared to FY2018 budget estimates, it has decreased by 6.3%. Some of this expenditure also include post-disaster reconstruction activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about subnational governments?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provincial and local bodies are getting Rs 499.40 billion. Rs 190.9 billion out of this is unconditional grants and Rs 308.50 fiscal transfer, which includes fiscal equalization and conditional grants. The government is not allocating matching and special grants in the budget. The total fiscal equalization and conditional grant for the seven provincial governments is Rs 113.40 billion (the largest amount Rs 19.90 billion going to province one). The total fiscal equalization and conditional grant for the 753 local governments is Rs 195.1 billion. Here is the breakdown for local governments:\\r\\n\\nMetropolitan cities: Rs 6.7 billion\\nSub-metropolitan cities: Rs 8.0 billion\\nMunicipalities: Rs 88.3 billion\\nRural municipalities: Rs 91.9 billion\\n\\r\\nApart from these grants, the government is also sharing an estimated Rs 114.2 billion revenue (based on monthly collections), with the subnational governments. These are substantial fiscal transfer and revenue sharing with subnational governments, which now will have to pass their budget before the start of FY2019. Except for revenue sharing, the fiscal transfer by central government is clubbed under recurrent spending and they constitute about 59% of total planned recurrent spending.\\r\\n\\n\\n\\nGrants to sub-national governments\\nRs (billion)\\n\\n\\nTotal grants\\n499.4\\n\\n\\nUnconditional\\n190.9\\n\\n\\nFiscal transfer\\n308.5\\n\\n\\nProvince\\n113.4\\n\\n\\nFiscal equalization\\n50.3\\n\\n\\nConditional\\n63.1\\n\\n\\nLocal bodies\\n195.1\\n\\n\\nFiscal equalization\\n85.2\\n\\n\\nConditional\\n109.8\\n\\n\\n\\nMajor takeaways from FY2019 budget\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, the finance minister has tried to rationalize spending by not increasing the federal budget like in the past for two reasons: (i) a certain portion of revenue need to be shared with subnational government; and (ii) the previous government’s bloated budget pretty much bound this government’s hands. However, like previous finance ministers, he has allocated recurrent spending more than total federal revenue (i.e, total revenue mobilization minus the portion that needs to be shared with subnational governments). Therefore, there is revenue deficit in FY2019 (likewise in FY2018 budget estimate but in revised estimate federal revenue is higher than projected recurrent spending).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, a robust, credible and a time-bound implementation plan to spend the earmarked money is missing, arousing suspicion over allocative efficiency in budget allocation. The last government also promised timely budget implementation. But as it turns out, barely 70% of capital spending is expected to be spent in FY2018. The core issues for chronically low capital spending (structural weaknesses in project preparation and implementation, low project readiness, bureaucratic hassle in approving and reapproving projects, poor project management and contractor capacity, high fiduciary risk in project implementation at subnational level, and political interference both at planning and operational levels) are hardly addressed in the budget. This raises doubt over timely budget execution. The Prime Minister led project implementation committee is not a new thing as he has been fulfilling that role in the capacity of chairman of the National Planning Commission, federal cabinet and Investment Board Nepal. Furthermore, empowering secretaries and project directors and amending procurement law are also not new.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, the finance minister has committed adequate budget for performing projects and has allocated initial funding for project preparatory work (mainly feasibility studies) of the government’s pet infrastructure projects (railways, waterways, ropeways, etc). However, in reality budget allocation, as a share of GDP, for capital spending is decreasing. The previous two finance ministers allocated over 11% of GDP for capital spending (but actual spending is around 7.9% of GDP). This year it is just 9.2% of GDP. It signals either the government could find new shovel-ready infrastructure projects or it just wanted to restrain spending in capital projects as well. Note that the government needs to spend at least between 8-12% of GDP in public infrastructure to bridge the infrastructure gap.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth, the new income tax slabs ideally ensures that those earning less will be paying less taxes (10% instead of 15%) and those earning more will be paying more taxes—which makes it a progressive tax structure. However, we need to note that Nepal hardly has one million officially registered for VAT and income tax.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth, related to the previous point, the revenue growth is too ambitious. The finance minister is aiming to increase revenue by 29.8% over the FY2018 revised estimates. Revenue has not grown at or above this rate since FY2009, when Baburam Bhattarai was the finance minister. Imports began to surge with generous bank credit and high remittance inflows, leading to large increases in tax revenue, particularly trade revenue. This time it is different, as the economy has pretty much reached its limit in terms of finding new sources for revenue growth unless more people and businesses are brought inside the tax net. This is also the most difficult reform, which every finance minister has tried to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nSixth, one argument is that 8% GDP growth target will mean more economic activities and hence more revenue mobilization. This is not realistic because the GDP growth target itself is unrealistic. In FY2018, the economy is projected to grow by 5.9% on the back of higher elections related spending and increasing construction activities. However, this year despite the forecasts of favorable monsoon, there won’t be extra government spending (like elections). The budget doesn’t have much to offer to the private sector except for assurances of business-friendly regulations, which every other finance minister has done. Public capital spending will likely remain around the present level given that not much is there in the budget to tackle the core issues for chronically low capital spending. Remittance growth is slow, affecting both import-based revenue and consumer demand. Hence, GDP growth— with favorable monsoon, continuing post-disaster reconstruction works, improvements in electricity supply and manufacturing activities, and local level spending— might at best hover between 5.5% and 6.5%.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSeventh, fiscal deficit is getting too large and this trend may jeopardize whatever sound macroeconomic balance Nepal has been having so far. It is expected to be 7.7% of GDP in FY2018 and 7.4% of GDP in FY2019. The government is borrowing so fast in the last few years that interest payment amount has increased to about 1% of GDP. Of this about 84% is for internal loans. Net domestic borrowing has jumped from about 2% of GDP in FY2017 to about 4% of GDP now. This means the government is raising too much money from the banking sector, exacerbating liquidity shortages and interest rate volatility. The government has nearly reached its limit in terms of how much it can borrow internally. Therefore, it is expecting very large increases in net foreign loan (from 1.5% of GDP in FY2018 to 6.8% of GDP in FY2019). This is not realistic because a major part of foreign loans (at least from the two big multilateral development banks) are on disbursement basis, which means the government needs to accelerate capital spending—an uphill task.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEighth, increasing cash incentive for exports up to 5% (from current 2 to 4% based on value addition) will hardly increase exports. What Nepal needs is an improvement in price competitiveness, facilitative infrastructure, and resolution of NTBs. Cost subsidization does not necessarily result in price competitiveness. Other significant issues include:\\r\\n\\nThere is also no basis or work plan to provide employment to 500,000 people. Loan at 5% interest against education certificate is not new (existed when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister previously). It could end up like Youth Self-employment Fund, which after much political interference is barely operating as it was envisaged.\\nThe government also is aiming to increase tourism inflows to 1.2 million by FY2019 and 2 million by 2020— a very uphill task. So is the target of doubling agricultural output in the next five years.\\nThere is also a line on waiving source requirement if invested in national priority hydroelectricity, international airport, road network, railways, industries with 300 domestic employment, and 50% use of domestic raw materials. This is politically-motivated investment plan designed to benefit a select few associated with CPN. A similar voluntary income disclosure scheme and investment plan was launched in FY2008.\\n\\r\\nOverall, a good budget and plan compared to previous year, but it falls short on departing from the past and setting a new trend. Fiscal prudence is mildly adhered to and it’s an achievement given the temptation of communist leaders to spend without ascertaining sources.\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThe first time Narendra Modi visited Nepal as the Indian Prime Minister (PM) in August 2014, fresh from a landslide election victory at home, he won over the whole country with his charisma and gestures.\\xa0\\nHe had already created groundwork for his humane image with revelation of adoption of Jeet Bahadur, a Nepali boy, a day before landing in Kathmandu. And he tactfully built on that getting off from his car to speak to the commoners on the street, shaking hands with a few and even walking for a while to soak in the applause from the smitten public.\\xa0\\nHe started his address to the Constituent Assembly (CA) in Nepali language and received thunderous applause from the CA members for almost every other sentence.\\xa0\\nThe people frustrated with the failure of Nepali leaders to deliver the constitution six years after the first CA election and lack of any progress even in the second CA were fascinated with his image of a doer, cultivated over a decade as the chief minister in Gujarat. He may well have beaten any Nepali leader in popularity polls among the Nepalis then.\\xa0\\nAs Modi arrives for his third Nepal visit as Indian PM four years on, the contrast could not have been starker. Civic receptions have been scheduled at multiple places to felicitate Modi reportedly on request of the Indian government conscious of his current image in Nepal. But security agencies would probably be sweating more about how to prevent embarrassing civic demonstrations than actual security threats.\\xa0\\nThere are already campaigns in the social media against Modi by irate users who are miffed particularly by the felicitations to be bestowed on him in the name of citizens. Many are even calling for a 10-minute blackout later in the evening.\\xa0\\xa0\\nOne need not even conduct any poll now to find out who the most hated person for Nepalis currently is.\\xa0\\nPlummeting popularity in a neighboring country would never bother most of the government heads. But Modi’s obsession with his image and popularity are legendary, and the apparent Indian request for felicitations, that were not deemed necessary for a popular Modi back in 2014, shows he is bothered.\\xa0\\nIt is an epic fall from grace for Modi in Nepal and delivers a brutal report card on his much-vaunted 'neighborhood first' policy launched by inviting SAARC leaders, including Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif, to his swearing-in ceremony on May 26, 2014.\\xa0\\nFour years on, Modi finds himself in an uneasy neighborhood, and relationship with every country in the immediate neighborhood with exception of perhaps Bangladesh, with whom his government signed a historic land exchange deal swapping control of some 160 small pockets of land in each other's territory, has deteriorated under his watch.\\xa0\\nModi went out-of-the-box to pay a surprise visit to Pakistan on Christmas day 2015 to wish the then PM Sharif on birthday. But a terrorist attack on an Indian Air force base in Pathankot a few days later, allegedly engineered by the Pakistani security establishment, prevented any détente between the neighbors.\\xa0\\nSharif, who wanted a cordial relation with India since his first term as PM two decades back, has since been disqualified for life by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in what is termed by many as a judicial coup by the military, and his successor Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has not showed the same zeal for friendship with India.\\nSri Lanka has granted a 99-year lease of the strategic Hambantota port to a Chinese company. The port, built with Chinese aid under China-friendly\\xa0Mahinda Rajapaksa regime, tellingly has been leased to the company\\xa0controlled by the Chinese government under President\\xa0Maithripala Sirisena, elected to the office as a consensus opposition candidate reportedly fielded with Indian blessings to replace Rajapaksa.\\nMaldives has shunned its decades-old 'India first' policy to become the second South Asian country after Pakistan to ratify a free-trade agreement with China while Bhutan after the Doklam standoff last year and reported military buildup there by China this year again, would not be exactly happy about how its outsourcing of foreign policy to India is working.\\nBut the deterioration has been greatest in Nepal that along with Bhutan provides the Himalayan buffer for India from China after annexation of Tibet 67 years ago. Nepal and India are not just neighbors, Modi never forgets to remind, pointing at the millennia of shared history and culture, and repeating his favorite term--roti-beti ka sambandh (relation of bread and daughters/marriage).\\xa0\\xa0\\nModi undid all the goodwill he earned in his first visit in 2014 by imposing an inhuman blockade in September 2015, less than six months after Nepal was devastated by the earthquake on April 25 expressing dissatisfaction over content of the newly promulgated constitution.\\xa0\\nMuch has already been written about the blockade, how it changed the dynamics of Nepal’s relationship with India and China, and fortunes of the political parties and leaders in Nepal. So, let’s not walk down that lane again.\\nReset seems to be the new buzzword while talking about Nepal-India relationship nowadays. This reset seems to be doing wonders bringing in Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj to Kathmandu to woo KP Sharma Oli, ironically the single largest beneficiary of the six-month blockade, even before he assumed office as the most powerful elected leader in Nepal’s history.\\xa0\\xa0\\nLeaders of the Madhes-based parties who enthusiastically thronged the Friendship Bridge at Birgunj-Raxaul border protesting against the ‘discriminatory constitution’ to provide alibi for the Indian blockade have voted in the parliament in support of the government led by Oli, their arch-enemy and the principal denier of an ‘inclusive constitution’ circa blockade, without changing even a punctuation mark in that very constitution.\\nOli, who won the election riding on the nationalist wave triggered by the blockade Modi imposed, was warmly received by Modi during his India visit last month, and the Oli government is bending over backward to flatter Modi during his two-day Nepal visit starting today.\\xa0\\nOne cannot change the neighbors and there is nothing wrong in improving relations with India. The two leaders, in fact, must be lauded for trying to rebuild the relationship between the two governments.\\xa0\\nBut the Nepali people, who suffered during the six months of blockade imposed immediately after the devastating earthquake, seem to be nowhere in the picture as the new-found infatuation between Modi and Oli plays out rather obscenely in the public.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nNepalis across the country, not any top political leader, suffered during the blockade, and the reset, therefore, should also be with the people.\\xa0\\nNepalis have never wished ill for India and have always wanted good relation with India. But trigger-happy India, still clinging on to the colonial mindset and the PMs acting like the viceroys did in British India, has repeatedly imposed blockade on whims.\\nThe last one was imposed by Modi in a fit of rage after Nepal refused to be dictated while promulgating the constitution.\\xa0\\nMany say the rage that culminated into the blockade was first triggered when the government refused to allow him his pilgrimage of the Janaki Temple during his second Nepal visit for the 18th\\xa0SAARC Summit in November 2014.\\xa0\\nWhen Modi phoned Oli to congratulate him on his party’s good\\xa0showing in the elections, the latter extended him invitation to visit Nepal, including Janakpur and Muktinath.\\xa0\\nFelicitation for a guest who is in Janakpur on the government's invitation should not be grudged. After all, Nepalis want to move forward leaving the blockade behind.\\xa0\\nBut by seeking another civic reception in Kathmandu after the one in Janakpur, Modi has reminded Nepalis his hegemonic persona and pain of blockade.\\nKathmandu was hit the hardest by the blockade and those living in Kathmandu have every right to be angry with the person who imposed it. Seeking an unnecessary second felicitation in the name of citizens who lived in misery for six months of his making adds insult to injury.\\xa0\\nIn the civic receptions he may again\\xa0repeat the cliche that Nepal India friendship is as tall as the Himalaya and as deep as the ocean. But the fact is, hundreds of such civic receptions in Modi’s honor and hours of flattering speech by him cannot reset his relationship with the people without acknowledging what he did in 2015.\\xa0\\nThere are speculations in the Indian media that Modi is visiting Nepal now to woo the Hindu voters in the state of Karnataka, that is going for polls on\\xa0May 12, through media coverage of his pilgrimage.\\xa0\\nHe may well have chosen the date with one eye on the assembly elections in Karnataka but it would not be fair to say that Modi, who started his political career as a full-time Rastriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) volunteer, is here solely for political reasons.\\nJanaki Temple may have political significance for a person elected on a ticket of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that rose after demolishing Babri Masjid to 'rebuild' Ram Temple in Ayodhya, and his prayer there may well be a symbolic reminder to the radical Hindu base that he has not given up on the holy grail of Ram Temple.\\nBut there is no denying the fact that the self-proclaimed Shiva-Bhakt is a devout Hindu and is here for his long-cherished pilgrimage of Janakpur and Muktinath Temple as a PM.\\xa0\\nOne prays not just for blessings but even to seek forgiveness for past sins. One hopes that, during this pilgrimage, he expresses remorse and\\xa0apologizes for the inhuman blockade to start the reset of relationship with the Nepali people.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\",\n",
       "  \"\\nThe occasional accession of Nepal to the tourism bucket lists that some famed travel magazines publish at different times adds to the excitement and hopes of both travelers and hosts. Travelers intrinsically intend to get best out of what their valued holiday time has to offer from their predefined destination choice and holidaying mode. In the case of mountain tourism in Nepal, the idyllic white mountain landscape and its majestic upstanding has always been a lure to international and even domestic travelers as a destination. Nevertheless, the stocking and auditing of tourism resources plus identification of constrictions for further development of the industry- a selling policy agenda among political parties especially ahead of election, in and between switching governments, tourism marketeers and stakeholders is, not under the purview of this article. This article simply aims to weigh on the evolutionary process that the mountain ecotourism in Nepal is heading onto amid the growth of international trekkers and domestic revelers in the region.\\nNepal as a trekking destination\\nPeople's restlessness to see as much of this planet has never been more thanks to the information technology and advancement in all three modes of transportation--air, land and sea. International arrivals to Nepal began along with the tourism spree that shot up international stayovers after the World War II. As historical data shows, the incremental international stayover to Nepal was even ahead of most other Asian nations in terms of time it began, and numbers visited by within a short span of decade. The first successful ascent of Mt. Everest has led to the craze of idiosyncratic mountaineering enthusiasts ever since. For others, just the glare of the snowclad mountains right next to their trekking hills is something more than once in a lifetime experience. This appealing imagination of touring uphills and around mountains if not summiting them, has been historically so inviting that people from western rich countries, perhaps out of stressful cosmopolitan life, sought to ‘escape’ into this rugged mountain terrain, trudging for weeks or even months with some porters hired to carry necessities. ‘Tents would have been set up at the village we ended up by the day with the help of the porters and dinners prepared at the camps,’ said a 78-year-old nostalgic British repeat trekker, this author encountered on the way, in exhausted tone. This routine journey continued along the beautifully-maintained and mostly stone-paved village trails to the complete peace and tranquility of the trekkers. This was a complete bliss for naturist ecotourists.\\nTrails to road and camps to hotels: a transition\\nThe development dream of native citizens to add to quality of life is something a modern democratic government should not and can not avoid. The fair share of this dream, since the inception of bulldozer spree brought upon after democratic government back in 1990 could not leave this ecologically sensitive zone alone. Poorly-planned or unplanned at most places, and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0reckless village access roads were the norms in the name of development as elsewhere in the country. The scenes become heart-wrenching when you see the centuries old, beautifully stone-paved trails of cultural, historic and touristic importance being trashed out by bulldozed dusty roads. Modernity is ugly when it overrides the historic heritage and cultural pride. The hedonistic trekkers have tramped leisurely on the serenity even at a place where a gentle nudge would be enough to roll them down the cliff. One could hear some murmur on how being misled from the peaceful trail to align with the superseding roadway was to their disgust. This is not the way the trekkers intend to submerge themselves and ‘escape’ out into the captivating paradise of nature through the trail. Upon this author’s curiosity, one of the villagers replied ‘We need road to reach to our village, tourism has nothing to do with us, it's only for some less than 10 percent.' With this reply a bundle of concerns, including that of not being opportune and left behind of far-flying tourism board, were spilled over. The villagers however, are right in a way. The only question is why not the midway? Why the planners and other stakeholders were so dumb to wreck the centuries old precious historic and cultural heritage and not plan a road through places whereby the trails would be intact?\\nThe other transformative change is booming of guest houses and inns in the villages along the trekking routes with modern ambience adding job opportunities for some. Gone are the days where the trekkers had to set up camps on the way. A trekker can book an accommodation where s/he intends to spend the night and day in. Some local produces are consumed and as a result farming is encouraged to reduce tourism leakages. It is however, still a question whether the involvement of some moneyed people from the community into this business, and other out of the board, keep the community integrity maintained so far, intact. What is in plan of all the agencies concerned to bring the fair share of tourism in the community to all its members, is a matter of concern.\\nConclusion\\nTourism in communities is touted as more sustainable, given its members have equal participation in it. A sense of place in community, adorned with past heritage and tradition is a vital tourism resource apart from environmental attraction. In the above case, it is rich in both. The local aspirations of improved accessibility and development at the cost of niche tourism resources mentioned above should be rejected outright. Sooner or later roads to human settlements like in Ghandruk village and Ghorepani\\xa0\\xa0will add to the development of the place and make lives easier for locals but settlements like such themselves, should not be linked with roads one to other except their linkages with core access roads like Nayapul or other market points, in such fragile trekking routes to avoid riding on top, to the woes of trekkers, animals and birds alike and even to the best interests of the hosts who will be affected most by the cutting of stayovers by visitors if allowed to ride from settlement to settlement.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nLately, I came across two female communist leaders who merited recognition for themselves as we are bracing ourselves for the communist government. But I first stumbled upon these communist leaders the roundabout way; the first one as the mother of the \\'most beautiful girl\\' in Nepal and the other one as the wife of the most powerful man in the country.\\nMunu Sigdel, the mother of Miss Nepal 2018 Shrinkhala Khatiwada, was some sort of a revelation to me. Commenting on her daughter’s achievements, she said, “We used to think of beauty pageants as the extension of capitalist endeavour to commodify women as objects of desire. But my daughter has convinced me that it is an intellectual competition, and I have come to see that myself.”\\nI personally have nothing against beauty pageants. I never thought of them strictly as an enterprise of commodification and nor am I convinced by Munu Sigdel’s epiphany of rediscovering it as an intellectual competition. But I find the process of her adjustment very fascinating.\\nThe interviewer never asked Sigdel what led her to change her opinion. Is it simply a maternal rationalization now that the daughter of communist parents, who for long stood against beauty pageants, has turned out to be a ‘beauty queen’? Or is it a gradual understanding that appearing attractive, and competing to prove it, is one of the many legitimate pathways for women to pursue success?\\nBut what does a ‘successful woman’ mean?\\nAnd this question brings me to another encounter. Radhika Shakya, the wife of current Prime Minister Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli, was mostly an unknown figure to me. But just today, I came across an article written by Binu Pokharel for Annapurna Post, when I actually got to know her as a personality. The article titled “Radhika : Ek Sadhika” (Radhika, a saint), not surprisingly, tries to deify Shakya. But what are these qualities that elevate her to the alleged sainthood?\\nThe article begins from an interesting premise, where Shakya is hailed for her rave academic achievements. And justifiably so as she turns out not only to pass her SLC in the first division, which was a big deal for those times but also graduate with history and economics majors. Her first encounter with the name of Mao Zedong and its lingering fascination kind of unravels her early socialist sympathy. She goes ahead and pursues her academic and political quests simultaneously. By the time Oli, the young, albeit sickly, communist leader, proposes to her, she already holds an MA degree and is working in a bank. Her willingness to juggle between family, politics and career marks a making of a woman who is already breaking the stereotype of a gender-normative domesticized woman, who is simply trying to find a good husband. Oli had no means to impress her with the prospect of a luxurious life but only with his intellectual tenacity. Shakya was the sort of woman who found intellectual tenacity of a man a good enough reason to marry him. It is not every day we meet women like these.\\nThen suddenly, fast forward a few decades, she seems to have lost all that. She is hailed as being saintly for having sacrificed herself to become a careful attendant to Oli. In the article, she fumes and fumbles around the house, running after the secretaries of her prime minister husband to make sure he took his medicine on time or had his food, or took his nap. Considering the earlier premise of the article, this part feels so anti-climatic. So, what happened to this woman, who had been thus enamored by Mao’s socialist dreams? Did she just recoil to being a caretaker, an appendage to a powerful man?\\nEven if she actually did, what contributed to this deviation? Does she sometimes sit silently by herself and wonder about her intellectual curiosity of the heydays? Does this woman, so qualified, sometimes regret being so bereaved of her individuality? What does she miss about her younger self? What is her vision about poverty and development? What is her assessment of historical progress and economic structure of our country now?\\nHer deification is a celebration of the loss of individuality.\\nJuxtaposed against each other, Munu Sigdel and Radhika Shakya represent the faces of communist idealists, who are trying to grapple what it means to be a communist and a woman in a communist-dominant nation, chasing, like everyone else, the capitalistic dreams.\\nBoth of these women have retained their paternal last name and not taken after their husband’s last name, as is the tradition. But is the rejection of husband’s patrilineal surname enough to carve an independent identity? Or, is it enough to validate beauty pageants as a veritable institute of female empowerment simply because a flock of admirers will listen to you because you have a pretty face?\\nHonestly, I don’t know.\\nA few years ago, I was sitting with a bunch of my friends who identify themselves as feminists. A new Miss Nepal had been recently selected. Over the cup of espressos, we were discussing how beauty pageants objectify women and reinforce them to take gender-normative roles. Gender-normative roles simply mean seeing men and women as binary opposites and insisting that the ‘normal’ person would naturally fall into the traditional gender roles. That way, Radhika Shakya, has eventually taken the traditional role of a caretaker and reinforced the ‘normal’ role of a woman.\\nBut soon enough, we were all exhausted by feminist rants, and to lighten the discussion, one of my friends, a woman, told us how she was rooting for a certain American soccer team. I can neither remember the name of the match or the soccer team and that pretty much sums up my interest and knowledge about what we usually know as football at this part of the world. Because I had nothing to contribute on the topic I started to compare football with beauty pageants. Surprisingly, they aren’t too different from each other. Beauty pageants insist that an ideal woman must be appealing to eyes, football, on the other hand, insists that men must be macho and competitive. Otherwise, how do you justify a bunch of men running after a ball to shove it into a post?\\nFootball is no more an intellectual competition than beauty pageants are, although of course, both the competitions require some common sense and intelligence. They are both means of reinforcing the idea of beautiful woman and powerful men, as the mark of desirability. But we never hear anyone protest against football match as an enterprise of the commodification of masculinity. Why?\\nOne way of understanding this moral dilemma is through what the feminists call “male gaze”. Originally coined by Laura Mulvey in her essay\\xa0Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema, this term denotes the way of looking at the world, particularly in relations to women, from the perspective of a man. We see a lot of advertisements where appealing women are juxtaposed against the commodity they are trying to sell. What does placing those women against the product say about the kind of audience the advertisers are trying to reach?\\nThey are assuming their primary targets to be men, to whose taste the image of female models has been crafted. Or maybe for the lesbians, who find that kind of women attractive. But do we, as women relate to such as the authentic representation of our idea of beauty? High heels, thick layers of makeup, skimpy clothes or perfect hair - do we resort to these looks when we are alone at our house when no one is looking at us? Maybe some of us do. But I, for one, don’t and therefore I find the idea of ‘male gaze’ convincing. And knowingly or unknowingly, we craft ourselves to please this invisible gaze. Certainly, appearing ‘beautiful’ is not the only way we respond to it.\\nBy seeing beauty pageants as the objectification of feminine body but failing to see how these soccer games reinforce the idea of macho man, our debate of individuality falls into the penumbra created by \\'male gaze\\'. The worth of an individual shouldn\\'t be judged in their ability to live up to the set standards of perfections; neither for women nor men. But until this point, even our feminism is incapable of coming out of the hangover of \\'male gaze\\'. The women who protest against beauty pageants should be protesting against football matches, too. Or the women, who enjoy football matches as a release, should enjoy beauty pageants the same way, too.\\nI find Shrinkhala Khatiwada beautiful and articulate. But even before winning the pageant, she was already an accomplished individual. She was academically outstanding, not unlike Radhika Shakya, and she was as much of a humanitarian as her mother Munu Sigdel, who had also been jailed during her youth for her radical call to social justice. But what crowned Khatiwada’s achievement was her winning a beauty competition. For whatever Munu Sigdel might say, they still call it a beauty pageant and not an intellectual pageant.\\nSo, whether we want to believe it or not, women are still defined by their looks or their domestic docility, as we saw in the apotheosis of Radhika Shakya.\\nWhy was Shrinkhala Khatiwada recognized as Miss Nepal and why was Radhika Shakya deified? Why did Khatiwada’s intelligence and humanitarian pursuits only got recognized after being declared the most beautiful woman of Nepal and why is Radhika Shakya compared to a saint, not for her academic achievements or her political astuteness, but for efficiently running errands for her powerful husband?\\nIs it all there for women to be celebrated? Or being powerful and macho is all there to being manly?\\nFor all our progressiveness, I still find our mass media, subliminally propagating these gender-normative values.\\nRevisiting the theory of Marx on his admirable book\\xa0Marx\\'s Concept of Man, Erich Fromm writes, \\'“This popular picture of Marx\\'s wish for uniformity and subordination - is utterly false. Marx\\'s aim was that of the spiritual emancipation of (wo)man, of their liberation from the chains of economic determination, of restituting them in their human wholeness, of enabling them to find unity and harmony with their fellow man and with nature. Marx\\'s philosophy was, in secular, nontheistic language, a new and radical step forward in the tradition of prophetic Messianism; it was aimed at the full realization of individualism.\"\\nAs we find ourselves on the brink of re-experimenting with Marx\\'s vision as a nation again, I hope the likes of Radhika Shakya and Munu Sigdel would be recognized and celebrated for their own merit and not as the shadows of powerful men and beautiful girls.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIn the last two decades, Nepal has endured a 10-year Maoist armed insurgency, a royal massacre, a revolution that led to the abolition of 240-year-old monarchy, unstable government led by multiple prime ministers, a massively destructive earthquake, devastating floods and an Indian blockade. In order to find better economic opportunities, many working age Nepalis have turned abroad. According to Nepal Rastra Bank, about 1,400 Nepalis left the country daily in 2014/15 to work overseas. In 2014/15, remittance contributed 29% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This remittance helps many who are without social support or local opportunities to earn.\\nHowever, the global economic slowdown, low fuel and commodity prices and the subsequent decline in investment, especially in construction and security services, have been weakening economic activities in the countries to which Nepalis migrate. For instance,\\xa0in November 2017, around 150 Nepali migrant workers were stranded in the Gulf state of Kuwait without jobs and many without valid stay permits after they were laid off by Kharafi National, a leading construction company.\\xa0This type of scenario is leading to a deceleration in remittance income flowing into the country. The overseas migration growth averaged 14.2 percent between fiscal years 2012 and 2014. The number of workers going abroad decreased by 2.8 percent in 2015 and then by a further 18.4 percent in 2016.\\nAddressing this issue is crucial for the Nepali economy.\\xa0But just as any public policy issue, the problem has to be analysed from multiple perspectives. While encouraging migration in support of strengthening remittance flows undermines the growth of the domestic economy by incentivizing young workers to leave Nepal, an increasing number of families are expected to be adversely affected if remittance inflow declines as these inflows are their key source of income.\\n\\xa0Given the current scenario, it is imperative for Nepal to pursue policies that will encourage more inflow of remittance in the short run and to invest in productive sectors that can gradually minimize the economy’s over-dependence on remittance over the long run. Sustaining remittances is necessary in the immediate term to protect the most vulnerable members of our population.\\xa0\\xa0However, broader dependency of the economy on migration is not sustainable as this type of income is susceptible to external shocks and international economic conditions. Some of the recommended policies to address this issue are discussed below.\\nEncourage migrants to send money via formal channels\\nMany migrant workers use informal channels to send money to Nepal which results in less resources for the government to make productive investments, encourages tax evasion, and negatively affects governance and exchange reserves.\\xa0There are three approaches that the government can take in order to encourage migrants to send remittance via formal channels.\\xa0\\xa0One would be to carry out country-to-country diplomatic dialogue to bring down transaction cost of sending home remittance. Dhananjay Shah highlights in his article “Hundi in South Korea: Nepal’s Remittance Channel”that\\xa0Hawala is a popular remittance transfer channel among Nepali migrant workers under Employment Permit System in South Korea due to the high cost of transferring money via formal channels.\\xa0\\xa0Economist Chandan Sapkota in his article titled\\xa0\"Remittances in Nepal: Boon or Bane?\"\\xa0states more than 80 percent of Nepali migrant workers use Hawala to remit money. It is recommended that the central bank initiates diplomatic dialogues with countries such as South Korea for reduction in such transactional costs.\\nSecondly, the government should invest in technology-based solutions such as digital payment methods to lower the financial transaction costs for low-income migrant workers. It could also subsidize the costs of these transactions to attract more migrant workers into formal channels to send remittance.\\nIssue diaspora bonds at competitive interest rates\\xa0\\nThe government should incentivize migrants to invest the fraction of their earnings not used for essential household consumption on government bonds by offering them a lucrative interest rate. Chandan\\xa0Sapkota’s research has shown that about 80 percent of remittance flowing into a household is spent on daily consumption and just 2.4 percent in capital formation. Given the sheer volume of remittance inflows to Nepal, the government could raise billions of dollars by issuing diaspora bonds and use it to finance productive investments. However, the rate of return in these bonds should be higher than the fixed deposit interest rates offered by banks and financial institutions for this policy to be effective.\\nLong-term investment and import substitution strategies\\nWith resources coming into the country through remittance and diaspora bonds, the government should finance long-term infrastructure such as roads, hydropower projects\\xa0and those sectors that can readily absorb technology such as telecommunications.\\xa0Apart from that, investment in tourism sector will also be helpful in increasing foreign currency earning. These policies would not only reduce the nation’s dependence on remittance, it would also contribute toward sustainable economic growth by stimulating the local economy.\\xa0These policies can also serve as import substitution strategies to absorb the potential shock in remittance inflows.\\nTransform the migrants structure from unskilled to semi-skilled and skilled\\xa0\\nMost of the Nepalis who go for foreign employment are unskilled. They have low level of earning resulting in a smaller fraction of income to save and send home. To address this issue in the face of declining number of outbound workers, the government should establish skill training centers for potential migrants across the country.\\nUse fact-based research to inform policy design\\xa0\\nThere are many instances when we tend to make assumptions about what policy works and what does not. However, using a scientific approach is more credible. If we can perform studies specific to Nepal, we should invest in country-specific research that involves rigorous data collection and analysis. When we don’t have resources to fund specific studies, policymakers can derive lessons from experiments carried out in other parts of the world. For instance, research\\xa0by\\xa0Nava Ashraf, Diego Ayciena, Claudia Martinez A, and Dean\\xa0Yang\\xa0has shown\\xa0that financial products that provide migrants with greater ability to monitor and control how remittance are spent can lead them to send more money home. Another similar study by\\xa0Ayciena, Martinez A, and\\xa0Yang has shown that\\xa0reductions in remittance fees lead to large increase in remittance sent to the migrant’s home country via partner financial institution i.e. through formal channel.\\xa0Similar programs can be tried out in Nepal and smaller pilot studies can be conducted before scaling up any policy.\\nThus, the implementation of\\xa0policies such as\\xa0those that encourage migrant workers to use formal channels to send money to Nepal, investment in long-term infrastructure and tourism, and deriving policy lessons from evidence-based research is the need of the hour. These policies\\xa0will\\xa0fend off the economic and social blowback arising from the slowdown in remittance. Hence, this issue needs to be prioritized and addressed promptly by the policymakers in Nepal.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            With groundless set of guidelines and widespread political pomposity, we are obliged to say that majority of our population live in urban areas. Majority of municipalities lack the basic physical infrastructures, let alone the urban amenities like parks or museums. Likewise, governability of those municipal institutions is already in question. In this complete “Mad Max” chaos of infrastructure and inept institutional and financial capacity of municipalities, “Smart City” is coined as urban panacea by political and bureaucratic players in urban milieu.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s explore the word “Smart City”, as most of us are aware about the technological superiority associated with the term itself. Before heading further, it needs some retrospections in our cities. So, until now, are our cities “Dumb”? Is smartness good for our cities? Or let’s explain the basics, what is “Smart” in city? Well, if we go through different international literatures and practices, it is associated with Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the goal of making effective, efficient and productive cities. Till date, there is no proper definition of “Smart City”, rather a contextual perspective where National\\xa0Planning Commission (NPC) identifies the “Smart city… introduction of Information Technology in the public service by public participation, accessibility, sustainability along with improvement in lives of people”, which is nothing but the ultimate theme of every global cities in the 21st\\xa0century.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing further, let’s start by addressing the elephant in the room. About a year back, the Government of Nepal proposed to have smart cities in Pokhara, Lumbini and Palungtar, Gorkha, which was later revised and more cities (numerous) were added to the wish list. That wasn’t enough of magniloquence, so political leaders from almost all the parties in local election expressed their idea of making cities smart, be it municipality or rural municipality. So, at the moment, most of the municipalities have allocated budget for hiring consultants to prepare report on smart city. It is imperative here to mention that many planners including myself is tangled in this chaos of unproductive planning activities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is pertinent to understand that it is not just politicians who are talking about the smartness of the city rather bureaucratic leaders who are working toward this institutionalized corruption in the name of big consulting expertise. Blatantly saying: the bigger the project, the bigger the cut is for the departments or institution associated with this. Because everyone knows, it is impossible to invest in smartness of the city when there is no city at all. For most of the political leaders, it is permissible as a political stunt, but it must be of utmost accountability of bureaucracy to come with smart solution for cities rather than smart cities.\\r\\n\\r\\nSmart city is nothing but addition of information and technology in daily life of citizens, with effective and efficient governance. In some academia, it is observed skeptically as the burden put by tech companies of the global market, but even ignoring those things, smartness associated with the governance and infrastructure are certain to make living effective and efficient. Another important aspect that we all agree is good governance for better future, which is coined as smart governance in technological world. Smart governance is more about using ICT tools for effective and efficient governance. As urgent as it sounds, are we sure that our community is ready to adapt with these new computing tools?\\xa0\\xa0In some shared terminology, smart cities are labeled as “marriage between physical world (city) and digital world (ICT)”, so, are our cities ready to get married? Is Palungtar ready to be a smart city?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is substantiated argument that smart cities are the future of urban phenomena and on some logical ground I personally might agree on that as well. But in the name of global rhetoric and political propaganda, aren’t we investing too much on this? Integrated data, standard infrastructure and well-equipped government are the fundamental needs of every urban sector; hence it doesn’t need another blanket of smartness.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the moment when we are evaluating the smartness of cities, we need to retrospect about sustainability and inclusiveness of the city that we are living in. People in our cities require more public toilets and water supply to drink rather than the free WiFi hotspots at every corner. People need big sideways to walk and fresh air to breathe, rather than lanes and lanes of roads for automated vehicles and warzone like roads while laying optical fibers alongside. It is about time that we are not swayed away with the ideological terminology like smartness of the cities, rather focus on the friendliness of the cities. It is time for us to invest in making our cities more lively and inclusive where some advanced global cities missed, in the name of industrial revolution and are turning behind to compensate on those. Unless we are making any utopian city like Masdar to captivate the global attention, we don’t need to prioritize smart cities as new urban need. Smartness can be added to the green European cities like Oslo, where urban infrastructures and amenities are not the matter for discussion rather linking them with every individual through smart connectivity is the challenge. In cities like ours, we need public spaces like parks and squares rather than connecting people in virtual spaces of Facebook and Twitter. We need inclusive public transportation first then only we can think of adding smartness to our mobility. And we need more honest and accountable government leaders and bureaucrats then only we can imagine of smart governance. We need cities with history, culture, society and people filled with wisdom and kindness, not cities overloaded with technological jargon of intelligence and analysis. Cities are to be beautiful, happy and giving, not smart and calculative.\\r\\nAuthor is an executive member of\\xa0Society of Nepalese Architects\\xa0(SONA)\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\n                            Senior advocate Surendra Bhandari has filed a complaint at the Kathmandu District Administration Office\\xa0Wednesday\\xa0accusing Chief Justice (CJ) of the Supreme Court (SC) Gopal Parajuli of threatening to kill him. He has appealed to the administration for security of his life.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne cannot even imagine a Supreme Court CJ in any civilized democratic country issuing such threats to the main advocate of a sub judice case against him/her. The issue must be investigated as a responsible senior advocate has made such accusations.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne thing is clear in this incident—one of Bhandari or Parajuli is guilty. The guilty, whoever out of the two that may be, would have committed not a minor offense, but an unpardonable crime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere will be no difficulty in finding out who the guilty is considering the technological progress of the modern world. An investigation by any honest and capable police officer using polygraph test and other technological tools will easily show who is speaking the truth and who is lying.\\r\\n\\r\\nA cursory look at the call details will reveal whether CJ Parajuli has repeatedly called Bhandari or not. An independent investigation of this incident to reach subsequent conclusion is necessary for the prestige of the SC and continuity of the public faith in the judiciary.\\r\\n\\r\\nBhandari has claimed that CJ Parajuli has been putting pressure for settlement of the sub judice case against Dr Govinda KC right from the beginning. He has accused CJ Parajuli of calling him to the CJ's chamber to put pressure for settlement of the case, phoning him to issue death threats, and finally sending thugs to his law firm.\\r\\n\\r\\nCJ Parajuli himself is a party in the sub judice case against Dr KC. The code of conduct prepared by SC itself prohibits any justice from contacting or meeting either party of a sub judice case. There can be no bigger attack on the integrity of the judiciary if CJ Parajuli has indeed done the things accused by Bhandari. Parajuli no longer has any moral authority to sit on that chair of CJ even for a minute if the accusation is true. It would be appropriate to protect the integrity and prestige of the judiciary by separating the CJ from the SC.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf senior advocate Bhandari has made false accusations, on the other hand, he will not just be unqualified for the title of senior advocate, he must be jailed for trying to mislead the people and contempt of court.\\r\\n\\r\\nNepal Police must investigate the incident with urgency to find the guilty in the case. Kathmandu Police has forwarded the letter sent for necessary action by the Kathmandu District Administration to Baneshwore Circle.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accusation has not been made against any street thug but is a serious accusation against the country's CJ. The police should not delegate the case lower to any circle. The Nepal Police Headquarters must expedite investigations under a honest and fearless police officer, and produce whoever is guilty before the court as soon as possible after completing the investigations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccountability of the political leadership is also equally important in this incident. We urge them to handle this incident with a sense of responsibility for destroying the main state institutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nPrime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba currently oversees even the Home Ministry. He must assure the people that the Nepal Police will investigate the case in a fair and urgent manner. We believe that the next government will fulfill that responsibility if Deuba displays incompetence in this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAware citizenry and the independent media also have a responsibility in this. It is the duty of the independent media and aware citizenry to prove that CJ was wrong if he really issued such threats thinking that nobody can investigate him and he will not be touched even if he issues death threats to Bhandari.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have an opportunity and also responsibility to establish that nobody, not even the CJ, is above the law in a state governed by rule of law. The faith of general public on rule of law will be boosted if we succeed in utilizing this opportunity. Our chariot of democracy will move forward. We are fully confident that we are capable of fulfilling this responsibility.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\nWhy heritage sites?\\nImagine, there are no literature works of Laxmi Prasad Devkota and there is nothing as such Muna-Madan, because in the 21st century there is no such Silk Route where Madan goes to Lhasa and Muna waits for her love. Imagine there is no Indra Jatra and nothing as such chariot procession, because in modern Nepal, the myth of Indra being caught appears more ridiculous than cultural, and is overshadowed by the eternal knowledge of science and technology.\\nImagine there is no Kasthmandap, Ranipokhari, or Durbar Squares!!!\\nAs steadily expounded in the book called “Sapiens-A brief history of humankind”, humans have this unique ability to weave stories and pass it into generation and generation, which enabled them to reach on top of the food chain avoiding the giant predators. Humankind is the result of longest process of evolution out of which consciousness and recollecting memories are unique characters which enable them to pass the knowledge of one generation to another resulting in advanced form of Homo sapiens (Wise Men).\\xa0 Hence, history is such a laboratory in this evolution process that serves as an open book for our generation and more generations to come. “A city without history is just like a person without memory,\" as commonly quoted in the field of conservation milieu is applicable in every field of development, especially in historical cities like Kathmandu.\\nWith the evolution of humankind and various development tools and technology, we have moved far ahead from caves to castles. There is a kind of argument which advocates that we should be investing our resources and energy in our future rather than waste them in the name of heritage conservation or preservation. Although, there is still a strong argument from the conservationists and historians that such ruins or structures from historical times needs to be preserved and needs to be studied for the better future.\\xa0 Authors strongly believe that every heritage, either tangible or intangible always have their own stories to tell to us and many generations to come. Here in below sections, we try to summarize on the different aspects on why such heritage structures or culture need to be preserved with wise investment of our knowledge and resources.\\nOur Identity\\nIn the era of globalization, we all have accepted that culture and heritages are the features that distinct each individual or community from other. Beauty of such differences are not only celebrated in global milieu rather appreciated as the proud identity. It is quite obvious for us that if any of our friends come to visit us, we take them to our historical locations or heritage sites. In doing so we are not only proud of our ancestors rather glorifying our roots. The identity associated to our culture or heritage is not only linked to any individuals but also epitomizes us as a civilized society and culturally enriched nation.\\nA tale to tell\\nWhenever there is any cultural/historical celebrations or dates are nearer, our national media are flooded with the mythological or historical stories associated with such events. Stories associated with such dates are animated in such a way that it glorifies the importance of events or structures hence promoting its preservation or conservation. Stories of Bijaya Dashami festival remind us to celebrate victory of goodness over the evil. Such tales are not only limited to the events or processions; every small heritage structure has its own story to express. Stories of Rani Pokhari glorify the importance of that urban lake in the middle of city when it is associated with the event dating back to the 17th\\xa0century. Similarly different religious heritage structures have their own stories to tell. Even a temple structure as small as the root of a tree, Pachali Bhairav at Teku has a convincing story to tell about the foundation of Kathmandu valley in 9th-10th\\xa0century. It would be comprehensible to understand such structures came into being when the majority of people did not have written recordings and the best way to deliver the message could be with some tangible stories.\\xa0 Destruction or degradation of such heritage structures are not only threat to the physical aspects rather chains the extinction of such social or historical information. Similar has been the case of\\xa0Shorakhutte, the\\xa0Pati\\xa0which had 16 posts until very recently has become extinct and so will the story of the\\xa0Pati\\xa0in the coming years.\\nAids local economy\\nAround 800,000 tourists are recorded to visit Nepal every year, and the number is increasing. The main attractions for the majority of tourists are limited to natural beauty or adventure and heritage structures of Kathmandu Valley, Lumbini or Janakpur. Tourism is often taken as prominent industry involving thousands of people directly or indirectly in Nepali employment sector. Figures show approximately 270 million, 60 million and 110 million respectively are added to the local governments of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, Lalitpur Metropolitan City and Bhaktapur Municipality respectively. The difference in revenues of Lalitpur and Bhaktapur is stark considering the latter is a smaller municipality with similar or lesser heritage structures, but with conserved and promoted heritages has enjoyed the economic benefits of such assets. Apart from adding to the local government’s economy, heritage sites are important market to flourish local souvenirs and engage a larger section of neighbouring people with day to day activities.\\nSpeaks of time, place and technology\\nEven till date, there has not been any concrete evidence to explain the technology used in construction of pyramids of Egypt or Elephanta Caves in India or Kailashkut Palace of Bishalnagar, Kathmandu. Heritage sites of such historical importance is not only the expression of marvelous knowledge over technology of that time period rather also portrays the living style of that time associated with its social, cultural and political scenarios. Malla period durbar squares cannot be simply taken as physical structures of architectural wonders, but they speak of the time and technology of that time period as a whole. Craftsmanship of carpenters and intricate details of sculpture expressed in idols/temples of Kathmandu Valley and technological genii of Nyatapol temple which enabled it to withstand two mega earthquakes, are evident of technological zenith of the Malla period in terms of art and architecture.\\nLessons for future\\nAs widely mentioned, heritages are the laboratories of history, which will guide our future. Heritage structures or historical knowledge are very significant for today’s society and more days to come. Knowledge associated with the historical stories, technological advancement associated with heritage structures and wisdom associated with culture are often scope of study in larger school of scientific thought. It will be pertinent to comprehend that many modern knowledge is the result of improved version of realization from past and learnings over the period of history. Simply considering, the knowledge of the lintel or sill bands in the modern buildings are derived from age-old technology of bands in heritage structures or wooden bands and larger windows in many traditional buildings of Kathmandu Valley. It is important to understand when we have ignored the traditional knowledge or historical evidence, we have always failed in bigger stage. Timber joist without the use of nail but with traditional joints allows the flexibility in structure, enabling larger heritage structures to shake with certain degree of elasticity. Whereas, similar joints with nails or other modern medium turns the structure into more stiff structure, leading to collapse of the structure. Similarly, such lessons are not only limited to the technology or stories of past rather simply analysing the information intended to deliver can be very helpful for future. Very pertinent aspect could be the collapse of buildings in Gongabu region of Kathmandu Valley in the 2015 earthquake due to effect of liquefaction. As the name of location “Gongabu” is translated from the indigenous Newari language, which means agriculture field where cock crows, it depicts the importance of land as agriculture field with wet fertile land, hence inferring to more possibility of liquefaction. Such stories or knowledges are not limited to a few cases, but in larger scope heritage structures have been open book for our steps in future.\\nThe preservation of historic sites or knowledge is a one-way-street where when we take the wrong path, there is no chance of getting back or at least a very limited chance. It is very imperative to understand that such heritage structures are not only assets of the present generation but duty of this generation to provide to another generation as it were handed over to us by the earlier ones. Saving heritage structures and knowledge is not only about saving some physical structures or keeping records of history; it is more about keeping our memories alive, nurturing our roots and fulfilling the basic duty of Homo sapiens: a duty of consciousness and extension of knowledge to coming generation for superior humankind.\\n',\n",
       "  \"\\nEditorial\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nParliamentary democracy operates on trust on certain norms and values, and rules. The parliament is at the center of that. The parliament forms the government and keeps the latter accountable to it. The government, therefore, is the representative of the parliament which in turn represents the people. Its executive authority remains so long as there is parliament. There is, therefore, parliamentary supremacy in parliamentary democracy. The parliament has its term which is determined by periodic elections. There is no way that the government formed by the parliament can exercise executive authority forever when the parliament itself is formed by the mandate of periodic elections. A government without a parliament, therefore, is not imagined. The government becomes caretaker once it announces the next parliamentary elections and wait for the next government starts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe provision of giving continuity to the government elected by the earlier parliament is kept only because an uninterrupted presence of government is necessary for operation of the state. A caretaker government can only do regular administrative works, and take contingent decisions. A caretaker government does not have authority to make policy decisions. Policy decisions have long-term implications and one must have the people's mandate to take such decisions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba has become a caretaker government from the day the process for general elections started. A caretaker government just has to do regular administrative works until the new government is formed. It cannot, and should not, do anything more. It should seek political consensus even if the article for removing constitutional obstacles may sometimes have to be exercised. This is a moral issue. Democracy stands on moral grounds as well as the rule of law.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decisions continuously made by the Deuba government after start of the election process are not merely administrative. It has also made policy decisions that can have long-term implications and put additional burden on the state coffers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis caretaker government by reducing the eligibility threshold for elderly allowance by five years has taken a big policy decision that will significantly increase the burden on state coffers. It similarly has also announced additional grant for earthquake and flood victims.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe decision to reduce the eligibility threshold for elderly allowance to 65 years is wrong in itself and irresponsible. The average lifespan of Nepalis has now increased to 68 years. It has been rising across the globe. Some countries have been raising the age for retirement as a result. This decision has been taken by a 73-year-old prime minister who has been dismissing the requests of fellow party members for him to retire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe threshold earlier was 70 years and around 900,000 were receiving elderly allowance. The number of recipients is projected to rise to around 1.50 million after the new announcement putting an additional annual burden of at least Rs 13.20 billion. This is almost two percent of the revenue target of Rs 730 billion set by the government for this fiscal year.\\r\\n\\r\\nA total of 767,000 households whose houses were destroyed by the earthquake of April 25 and May 12, 2015 are eligible to receive government grant. The government immediately after the earthquake had announced a grant of Rs 200,000 for the earthquake victims. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government formed with support of Nepali Congress (NC) had announced an additional Rs 100,000 for each household around 18 months back. This caretaker government has again increased it by Rs 100,000 putting an additional burden of Rs 76.70 billion. There has been no discussion and debate about why the grant was increased to Rs 300,000 from Rs 200,000, and again by Rs 100,000 now.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government had allocated Rs 36 billion for social security allowance for the current fiscal year, and officials are saying the amount will fall short by Rs 4 billion even before the latest announcement. NC has been claiming that communists work for cheap popularity. The joint election manifesto of CN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) has pledged to raise elderly allowance to Rs 5,000 a month from Rs 2,000. Deuba has taken this irresponsible decision as a political one-upmanship over the left alliance that will form the next government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government had earlier been exercising prerogative authority by continuing political appointments and providing financial assistance. Its functioning was like that of a regular government with the people's mandate. Its activities as a result were arbitrary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis caretaker government similarly is trying to amend the Nepal Police Act to remove the provision of 30-year limit for service. It is another irresponsible and immoral effort on the eve of formation of a new elected government.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government's preparation to remove the 30-year service limit in Nepal Police has raised suspicions about its intention. The IGP and 16 AIGs are retiring in April due to the 30-year service limit. This eagerness to amend the provision has raised serious suspicions about financial influence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe want to remind this caretaker government that a caretaker government should not take any policy decision. Parliamentary democracy will be strong only with rule of law exercised on moral grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeaceful transfer of power in democracy also means ethical transfer. Taking policy decisions that can have long-term implications by a caretaker government which should only do regular administrative works is serious betrayal toward parliamentary democracy. This will harm the people's faith in democracy.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n                            Optometry is a noble profession providing eye and vision care services to the general population all over the world. The integral role of optometrists in providing these services to reduce avoidable blindness cannot be overemphasized. Optometrists have varied levels of training and provide eye care from primary to sub-specialty level in different countries all over the world including Nepal. Nepal has been producing optometrists since 2001 but their recognition and inclusion in the mainstream eye health care system remains elusive.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe scope of optometry practice differs across countries throughout the world depending on the level of education and practice legislation provided to them. Practice settings and higher education opportunities also vary. North American countries like the United States (US) and Canada have optometry programs at the doctoral level that usually require a bachelor’s or pre-optometry degree for enrollment. Optometrists in these countries perform comprehensive eye exams, provide vision correction and assistive devices like spectacles, contact lenses and low vision devices, administer vision therapy to treat binocular vision problems, prescribe medications to treat eye diseases and even perform laser eye surgeries in some states. They practice in a variety of settings like private clinics, hospitals, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), state and federal health care agencies, army and higher education institutions. They can also obtain master’s and PhD degrees at a number of higher education institutions. European, Asian and African countries where optometry has a longer history, have programs at the bachelor level with some countries offering a six-year doctor of optometry program after high school. The practice scope in these countries is usually similar to that provided by the American optometrists with limitations in surgeries. They work in similar settings as their American counterparts. Countries that did not allow optometrists to prescribe drugs for diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases previously have started to permit such privileges. There are also some countries with no legislation for licensing or defining the scope of practice. Some institutions in the UK, Norway, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and India offer higher education in optometry and vision science awarding master’s and PhD degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nepal, optometry is currently taught as a 4-year bachelor’s degree at the Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj Medical Campus (IOM, MMC) of Tribhuvan University. The legislative body controlling the licensing and practice of optometry in Nepal is Nepal Health Professional Council (NHPC). According to the code of ethics for optometry practice approved by NHPC, optometrists can examine eyes, prescribe vision corrective devices, vision therapy, use drugs to help in diagnosis of ocular disease and prescribe drugs to treat those diseases. Optometrists mostly practice in eye hospitals/institutions run by NGOs or by private companies. A few have gone to private practices. Although optometrists have been produced for the last 18 years, they have not been provided suitable positions in the eye care sector by the government of Nepal. Those that want to get higher education have no institutions to go to in Nepal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOphthalmologists are the other independent eye care practitioners in Nepal who have a doctor of medicine degree and can prescribe vision corrective devices, drugs to treat diseases and perform surgeries. There is a third large group working in the eye care field in Nepal who are known as Ophthalmic Assistants (OAs). As the name says, they are assistants to ophthalmologists and have a certificate/diploma in ophthalmic science. They assist in eye hospitals and clinics and have also been placed in primary eye care centers in the rural areas. Since the enforcement of health care laws are weak\\xa0in Nepal and the general population does not understand the differences between these eye care providers and quacks, optical outlets with the sole purpose of selling glasses and making profit run by quacks are rampant. Even ophthalmic assistants have been found to call themselves optometrists and practice in such clinics. There is no clear demarcation and law enforcement on who can practice in an independent eye care setting or establish an optical shop. This has led to profiteering by optical business owners with little regard to the eye health of the patients. The public is also unaware of the differences between various eye care practitioners and are duped into unnecessary optical correction and treatment advised by the unscrupulous practitioners.\\r\\n\\r\\nEighty-two optometrists have graduated from IOM in Nepal till date, of which almost half (38) of them have left the country. Attainment of higher education has been the major motive for moving out of the country although a few have emigrated for better paying jobs and recognition of the profession. Lack of opportunities in career growth and, higher education in the country in addition to the lack of respect for the profession from the ophthalmic fraternity have contributed to the emigration.\\r\\n\\r\\nA new bachelor of optometry and vision science program was announced by National Academy for Medical Science (NAMS) about a month ago citing lack of qualified eye technicians in the country. It is a welcome news that a new optometry program is starting but derogating independent professionals as mere technicians is not acceptable and will certainly not improve the mutual respect between different eye health professionals in Nepal. The new program itself seems questionable as to whether it is going to produce well-qualified optometrists. The entrance exam consists of 40% of ophthalmic science knowledge that seems to be biased toward the ophthalmic assistants. Although I am not against providing higher education opportunities to OAs, a heavy emphasis on ophthalmic science in the entrance exam will result in only OAs getting into the program. Is the purpose of the program to produce technicians that have a bachelor’s degree? A separate entrance exam for 10+2 graduates and OAs focusing on their background knowledge would be much better.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, the course only has six months of basic science instruction, which is very short. Even a one-year basic science course in the currently available optometry program at IOM, MMC has been deemed short by graduated optometrists. A fellowship opportunity in optometry has also been announced by Nepal Netra Jyoti Sangh, Biratnagar Eye Hospital, which is also a welcome step, but no specifications have been provided on what the specialties are for the fellowship. This creates suspicion on what the motives are behind the program and how the program will be run. Fellowships usually are higher education programs and need optometrists/ophthalmologists with higher education credentials in that specific sub-specialty. Many questions have arisen about the start of these two programs. Do the hospitals have enough optometry faculties to provide instruction? Is it fair to recruit students without recruiting required optometry faculties? Have the hospitals fulfilled all other requirements to open a new optometry/fellowship program and have they been cleared by the regulatory authority, NHPC to run the program? Will the fate of these programs be like the private medical colleges that are mushrooming in the country? Will there be a need for another Dr Govinda KC to sit for fast-unto-death in optometry too? The most astonishing part is that optometrists in Nepal, even those who have Master’s and PhDs and their professional association, the Nepalese Association of Optometrists (NAO) are not included in any of these decision-making processes like starting a new optometry program. When professionals with experience of over 17 years in the country itself are not given opportunities in decision making processes for their own profession, there is obviously going to be resentment, which will ultimately lead to bigger emigration of optometrists to foreign countries. That is not what stakeholders in eye care will appreciate very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sum up, an environment of mutual respect between various levels of eye care practitioners and opportunities of involvement in decision making processes for the optometrists along with a career progression ladder are the major needs of optometry in Nepal. Doctors of Optometry practicing as primary eye care providers and recognition among health care fraternity and the public along with optometric experts in various subspecialties should be the main goal of any optometry program to be started in Nepal, if the core objective of eliminating avoidable blindness from the country is to be fulfilled.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Dr Panthi ( B.Optom.

       "  \"\\n                            He who goes slowly goes far, goes an old saying.\\r\\n\\r\\nCPN (Maoist Center) and CPN-UML initiated the talks of electoral alliance and party unification with distant objectives. Their destination was finally achieving socialism through stability, development and prosperity in the country by winning the election and forming a stable government for five years.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther issues attracted the people, eve as the communist jargon of socialism was difficult to comprehend, and they elected the left alliance with a big majority.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the objectives of reaching far were set in a hurry. Such big and far-reaching objectives were determined in a hurry without knowledge of anyone apart from a few leaders. The secrecy was so-well maintained that the media could not write about the alliance with certainty even a day before the formal announcement.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are enough signs showing that the unification campaign started in a hurry is now in problem. The top leaders of the parties, that aim to lead the government and go for unification, could not even meet for the past few days. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal left Kathmandu for Chitwan\\xa0on Friday\\xa0abandoning an important meeting of the coordination committee for unification that was already scheduled for\\xa0Saturday.\\r\\n\\r\\nDahal returned to Kathmandu only\\xa0on Tuesday. Dahal and Oli met\\xa0Wednesday\\xa0but failed to make any breakthrough. Dahal's comments while outside Kathmandu has vitiated the environment of party unification and formation of left government.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe hope that the doubts and suspicions seen now are temporary, and both the parties will come together to soon form the government and unify the parties. We want to remind the leaders of the two parties the following things amidst the current uneasiness.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, both Dahal and KP Oli during the recent parliamentary and federal assembly elections had promised to the people to form a left government and unify the parties. The two parties had solicited votes preparing a single election manifesto. To part ways by tearing that manifesto would be an insult of the mandate. The parties may have their own difficulties but those difficulties definitely are not bigger than the promises made to the people. They will have to tackle the difficulties facing the unification process to fulfill the promises made to the people.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, the unification of the two left parties will have a lasting meaning for political stability in Nepal. We have held the first parliamentary elections after promulgation of the republican constitution, and ended a long period of transition. We have the challenges of working for stability, development, good governance and social justice by maintaining political stability. We also have the challenges of establishing cordial relationship with the two neighbors through a balanced foreign policy amidst the challenging geopolitics, and also reaping benefits from economic development of China and India.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be difficult for us to face any of these challenges if our domestic politics continue to be as volatile and unstable as in the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nReform of political parties is another important agenda. It will not be possible for the country to take a leap to achieve good governance, development, and stability if the parties were to operate in the current structure and fashion. Unification of two left parties will build self-confidence for internal reform. Debate and discussion will start in the united left party about how to institutionalize internal democracy inside the party, how to hand over responsibilities to capable individuals and make them accountable, and how to maintain transparency.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnification of the left parties will also certainly put pressure on another big party Nepali Congress (NC) to reform. The voice of those who say the party needs to be revitalized will become stronger. The issue of reform in parties will again be put on the back burner, and the musical chair for power among the incompetent parties will continue if unification does not materialize.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, unification of two big parties definitely is not easy. The foundations for this, perhaps, was not and has yet to be created. The then electoral arithmetic directed the issue of electoral alliance and party unification in a big way. The realization that they will win more seats in case of alliance and they will lose many seats without one overshadowed other important issues. The issues that were overshadowed then have become powerful and tricky now that the elections are over. Leaders and cadres of both the parties now feel deep love for their respective parties. This is not surprising. Concerns and interest about the future of the party created by the leaders and cadres dedicating their whole life is normal. The Maoists fear that their party, and their political career will be finished. UML leaders also worry their party will be damaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dimensions of the positive changes unification of left parties can bring about are far bigger than these fears and concerns. The left parties, therefore, must be able to overcome that immediate concerns with the hope of\\xa0tomorrow. It is the hope of\\xa0tomorrow\\xa0that will drive the party and the country forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe, therefore, urge UML and Maoist leaders to come together and move forward together. Do not lose direction and hope so soon. Do not forget the promises made to the people.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n                            An office which is already vacant need not be vacated again (and that too, by insanely invoking an Article of the Constitution which has already been exhausted).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0The elections to the House of Representatives (also to the Province Assemblies) have been held and the results are quite discernible. The winners-to-be (‘to-be’ – because the results are yet to be declared officially by the Election Commission) seem to be content with the results and are now in discussion with regard to the formation of a new government (Council of Ministers). At the same time, they are demanding that the incumbent Prime Minister should resign in order to pave way for the formation of a new government.\\xa0This write-up is regarding what the Constitution (and the common-sense) has to say about PM’s resignation.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, I wish to drag the readers’ attention to Article 298(8) of the Constitution of Nepal. This provision is about the vacancy of the post of the Prime Minister appointed according to that Article (Article 298 – which deals with the formation of Council of Ministers in the transitional period, i.e. before the first General Elections are held after the adoption of the Constitution). The provision reads:-\\r\\n\\r\\nThe office of the Prime Minister appointed in accordance with this Article shall be vacant in any of the following circumstances:\\n(a) if he or she\\xa0tenders resignation\\xa0in writing\\xa0to the President,\\n(b) if a vote of no-confidence is passed\\xa0against him or her or a vote of confidence is not passed in accordance\\xa0with Sub-article (14),\\n(c) if he or she\\xa0ceases to be a member of the\\xa0Legislature-Parliament,\\n(d) if he or she\\xa0dies.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can see that there are four ways how the PM’s office is vacated. What the winners-to-be of the election are demanding is that the PM should invoke\\xa0Clause (a) of Article 298(8)\\xa0and resign from his post thereby.\\r\\n\\r\\nI (and anyone who reads the Constitution) believe that this argument or demand put forward by the winners-of-the-election appears to be\\xa0non compos mentis. Rather, it is an unconstitutional demand. For this we have to eye Clause (c) of the Article 298(8), where it has been written that the PM’s Office will be vacant as and when he\\xa0ceases to be a member of the Legislature-Parliament.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Legislature-Parliament-in-question is that very Legislature-Parliament which has been dissolved under Article\\xa0296(1)(1)(para-2)\\xa0back on\\xa0October 15\\xa0(midnight). The PM’s office has been vacated at that very day/moment, i.e. Article298(8) has already been exhausted.\\xa0Sher Bahadur Deuba’s office has already been vacated as per Article 298(8)(c). Hence, there is no need to invoke the same Article again – i.e. an office which is already vacant need not be vacated again (and that too, by insanely invoking the same Article of the Constitution).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo why is Deuba still acting as the PM even after October 15, 2017?\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe this question has an answer in itself. The word ‘acting’ in the question answers it. PM Deuba is an ‘acting’ Prime Minister, a lame duck, who has to serve (rather, is constitutionally obligated to serve) as the PM\\xa0until a new Council of Ministers is formed. Article 298(10) of the Constitution backs this statement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf so, why are people demanding the PM’s Resignation?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my personal opinion, there could be three reasons why people are demanding Deuba’s resignation.\\r\\n\\nThey are just too busy to give a look at the Constitution and haven’t read it,\\nThey are short of common sense, or perhaps not in the right side of their minds, or\\nThey are trying to create a propaganda against Deuba guy by accusing him of ‘not paving way for the formation of a new government’ or ‘he wants to stay in office forever’ or that ‘Deuba doesn’t respect the people’s mandate expressed in the polls’\\xa0 – thereby\\xa0trying to further deteriorate his public image.\\nSupporters or sympathizers of Deuba who don’t want the propagandists to be successful in their mission, and want Deuba to ‘look good in front of people’ by resigning.\\n\\r\\nWhile we cannot really blame people if it is for the first and the second reasons that people are demanding Deuba’s resignation. I don’t even want to call them schmucks. But if it is the third reason, the people vociferating in this issue are just crazy, bad, wrong,\\xa0 egregious, shameful, awful and what not!\\xa0The most shameful part is that the same bunch of people can be spotted caterwauling that the current government should not take major policy decisions and make appointments because it is a caretaker government. On the one hand, you call this government caretaker, and on the other hand you ask for that PM’s resignation who is already a caretaker?\\xa0These egregious political-propagandists must be condemned, and stopped!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, should Deuba still resign?\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter I’ve said all this, I don’t really think that I should answer the question, as it is obvious that he should not! I would rather like to suggest the Right Honorable President of Nepal that even if Deuba comes to the\\xa0Sheetal Niwas\\xa0to\\xa0submit his resignation, she should not accept that and ask Deuba to go back to Baluwatar or wherever he will come from. That way, the President would fulfill her duty to preserve and protect the Constitution, and rather by stopping the PM to violate a Constitutional Article! Even the sympathizers of Deuba should not pressurize him to resign, thereby violating the Constitution, or rather making fun of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, can a new government be formed without the incumbent’s resignation?\\nCertainly, YES!\\xa0This is because Deuba is not really an incumbent in the office of the Prime Minister of Nepal. Currently, he is not only a lame duck, but rather is merely a caretaker Prime Minister who cannot really take vital decisions (on this point I agree with the parties currently in opposition (Oh! Did I forget, some in the opposition are still in the government though, but anyway, you know what I mean) that Deuba as a caretaker PM shouldn’t be taking major policy decisions).\\r\\n\\r\\nAs soon as the Election Commission declares the results of the elections to the House of Representatives, the President can invoke Article 76(2) of the Constitution and appoint a new Prime Minister. (Again, I’d agree with the opposition or whomever that National Assembly need not be formed in order to form a new Council of Ministers).\\xa0I congratulate him\\xa0(the new PM to be appointed) in advance and wish him a successful tenure, but people should really stop giving a pressure to their throats by shouting that Deuba should resign as PM!\\r\\n\\r\\nKalika is pursuing BALLB from Nepal Law Campus.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n                            When the first light of dawn hit the horizon, painting the sky with deep pink, shades of blue and yellow, we realized that, if we were to capture the sunrise, we cannot afford to spend more time on the way. I packed my camera gears in no time and we were almost running. We were about 45 minutes away from making it to the top of Pathibhara.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far, I had struggled to climb the steep steps and trail leading to the temple and a few sessions of long exposure night photography, here and there, were my excuses to catch my breath, and pretend that I am a strong man with a big interest in trekking in the mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now that I were cornered, I had no option other than keeping the pace with my partner Ganesh Basnet—District Coordinator for One Heart Worldwide in Taplejung—who was at home amid these mountains.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Wearing socks over shoes reduce the likelihood of slipping on snowy steeps,” shouted Ganesh with some irritatation, and smirk on his face, reckoning that I was struggling to keep up with his pace and was clinging on anything that I could get my hands on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I was very skeptical about it in the beginning, despite Ganesh explaining me that is how people trekked when it was ‘icy slippery around here,’ I admired the cleverness of it after giving it a shot. Not only I was confidently stable, I was even running like I have forgotten everything and enjoying the crushing sounds of snow-crust under my feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was as if we were walking beside the snow rails—the bundle of strings that devotees tie from Sano Pathibhara, a miniature temple devoted to the people who cannot make it to the main temple due to different health conditions like altitude sickness, had gathered thick snowflakes and looked like some kind of structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was completely out of breath by the time we reached the gate of Pathibhara temple. But soon I gave in and surrendered to the spectacular sight of the place. As the mountains were slowly coming to life with the breaking of the dawn, I was awestruck by the grandeur of the Himalayas, standing tall and embracing us as if we were their children.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are hundreds of bells, offered by the devotees, hanging from the metal railings on both sides along the final climb leading to the premises of the Pathibhara temple. No matter your belief on the religion, there is something aesthetically sacred, spiritual and liberating about this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have never such an ocean of cirrus clouds blanketing the valley below. It was one such mesmerizing sight that remains etched in your memory but cannot be described in words. As the sun rose from behind the mountains, my heart leaped up realizing how lucky I was beholding such sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nPathibhara is certainly one of the most beautiful places in Nepal, if not the best, that offers the best panoramic view of the Himalayas. The unforgettable experience was worth all the trouble after our decision to leave for the temple at three in the morning to see the sunrise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main statue of goddess Pathibhara, all covered in vermilion, prayer flags and offerings made by the devotees, people even offer gold and silver jewelries for fulfillment of their wishes from the goddess, lies in the open. There is a dedicated pagoda-style house where animals are sacrificed to the goddess and big ritualistic-worships are organized.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough we visited Pathibhara in the second week of March this year, we were lucky that it had snowed a day early. It was unexpectedly cold for the month. Our cell phones died instantly.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow to get there\\r\\n\\r\\nI flew to Biratnagar, before hopping on a public jeep to Taplejung headquarter Phungling. It took us around two and half hours from there to reach Sano Phedi, the first stop of the trek, on a motorcycle. The ride on this stone and mud remote road was unquestionably difficult. It was almost six in the evening when we reached Sano Phedi.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe trekked for almost an hour to reach Thulo Phedi, where we called it a day. We stayed inside a tent on the hotel’s courtyard—which was very comfortable. It takes around three hours of steep trek to reach the top of Pathibhara and, from my experience, everyone should start early to strive to behold the amazing sunrise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\xa0\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://youtu.be/gX_rQ65KFCA\\r\\n\\r\\nVideo-\\xa0Krishna Dangi\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIt is no secret that Universal Health Coverage has become a hot topic in the international community. With all UN Members states - including Nepal - signing on to try and achieve Universal Health Coverage by 2030, more attention is being paid to how governments can make healthcare affordable, all-encompassing, accessible and adequate. One of the targets for this goal is to reduce the global maternal death rate to less than 70 per 100,000 live births. Nepal has made commendable strides toward this goal: the maternal mortality ratio in Nepal decreased from 539 deaths per 100,000 live births to 239 deaths per 100,000 live births between 1996 and 2016.\\nNepal’s progress, while impressive, has not been evenly distributed. Take rates of postnatal check-ups (PNC) as an example of this. PNC visits are an important part of maternal health services wherein providers can check for warning signs of postpartum hemorrhage, postnatal depression and other life-threatening conditions.\\xa0 According to the 2016 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, nearly 64% of urban women received a postnatal check-up within two days of delivery, as compared with 48% of rural women. Women in the highest socioeconomic status were more than twice as likely (81%) to receive postnatal care within two days of delivery as women in the lowest (37%).\\nTo guarantee a future where no child grows up without a mother due to pregnancy-related death and no parent loses their child during the critical period of labor and delivery, the current approach to Universal Health Coverage won’t cut it. This is especially true for women living in remote and hard-to-reach parts of the country. Women and children should be the preferential beneficiaries of Universal Health Coverage because they are especially vulnerable to healthcare inequalities. This is true for all women and children, but it becomes worse for women in those inaccessible areas I just mentioned.\\nIn the years I have been helping to implement the Network of Safety model with the nongovernmental organization One Heart Worldwide, I’ve realized that investments in the health of women and newborns are investment in #HealthForAll. I’ve learned how a single issue - maternal health - can drive large-scale, systemic change, and on World Health Day 2019, I’m writing to share three of the most relevant lessons-learned for Universal Health Coverage advocates:\\nService integration creates more pathways to vital healthcare services.\\nBoth the Universal Health Coverage agenda and our approach to scalable maternal health systems task-shift (delegate tasks to less specialized health workers) to provide multiple services in a single visit. By offering primary care services and strengthening the public health system of Nepal, programs like ours that place the mother and child at the center of their efforts reach the most marginalized people and ensure they have access to important services. When the nearest health facility to an expectant mother is a three-day trek over mountains, up hills and around rivers, the care she receives must be efficient. Delivering healthcare in a manner that maximizes resource use and minimizes waste has been essential to the success of our programs and must be a priority for any attempt to build a Universal Health Coverage system.\\nLook outside the traditional health systems approach for inspiration.\\nTo effectively deliver services in hard to reach places, we have used innovative approaches to reach the “last mile.” For example, we incorporate solar-powered suitcases to overcome the problem of unreliable electricity and employ eHealth and mHealth to collect better data and reform supply-chain management. That being said, innovation is not just about technology. We have had to think creatively about how to build a partnership of government officials, local leaders, community members, fathers, mothers-in-law, outreach providers and healthcare workers to surround the mother and her unborn child. At One Heart Worldwide, we call this evidence-based approach the Network of Safety because we know it takes a holistic approach to drive positive change. These opportunities are not unique to maternal health, and can be replicated in other priority issues, making this an applicable lesson from maternal health for Universal Health Coverage advocates.\\nGender equality is both a prerequisite to and consequence of Universal Health Coverage\\nGender equality and #HealthForAll are interdependent. On one hand, I have seen gender act as a barrier to healthcare access, as women sometimes lack the agency they need to demand maternal health services. The unique healthcare needs of women are often excluded from basic healthcare packages, often at the detriment of entire families and communities. On the other hand, I have also seen community-level opinions on gender empowerment change through discussions on maternal health and by training Female Community Health Volunteers,\\xa0 nurses, and Skilled Birth Attendants.\\xa0By prioritizing women’s health and training women to be healthcare providers, we have worked to advance gender equality through maternal health programs on both the supply and demand sides of care.\\n(The author is One Heart Worldwide (OHW) Country Representative for Nepal)\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            The huge public outcry to fix the system and the demand for justice following the rape and murder of 13-year-old Nirmala Panta gave me, if nothing else, a little hope for the upliftment of women’s situation in Nepal. That reminded me of Jyoti Singh’s gang rape and murder which shook India to its core and made the people come together as a nation to look at the existing traditions and political system that allowed such atrocity to take place. On the one hand, it is inspiring to see how much attention people can draw to important issues if they genuinely feel a need for change. But on the other hand, it astonishes me that South Asian countries like Nepal and India need horrific crimes like a girl getting brutally murdered after having a rod inserted in her vagina or a 13-year-old raped and thrown in a sugarcane field for people to finally be enraged and take action. Can we not get angry when a girl becomes the subject of a perverted male gaze in a public vehicle? Or is the intensity of the situation not urgent enough and we have to wait for the girl to be brutally raped?\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the data maintained by Nepal police, in the fiscal year 2073/74 ending in July, 2017, 1,117 cases of rape and 527 attempts to rape were reported. Yet, cases of harassment and violence against women only feature in tiny five-line columns in newspapers or 30-second segments in televisions. Is that all the attention merited by such serious issues? We have let such heinous crimes repeat over and over again so many times that a couple of harassment and rape cases in a newspaper barely draw a glance from the reader. It sounds horrific to say, but we have normalized rape and violence against women in our society.\\r\\n\\r\\nFew weeks ago I came across a notice by Nepal Police, Biratnagar with a title “For chhori/ cheliharu (daughters/sisters) including 10 bullet points mentioning what they should and should not be doing, especially on the internet. Two of the mentioned points were, “while texting online, do not exchange excitable pictures that would encourage rape” and “think about the consequences the unsuitable accidents might bring to the reputation of your family.”\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nLet’s start with the term chhori/cheliharu which is grossly overused in every context in Nepal. The patronizing term refers to women not as independent beings by themselves, but in relation to somebody else, implicitly men. It implies that women cannot exist without a male point of reference and need men to validate their existence. Do we ever refer to men in Nepal as chhora/chelaharu (sons/brothers)? If not, why are women always referred to in terms of some relationship to men be it chhori/cheli or didi/bahini? Even now, our society refuses to accept that women are capable of standing on their own feet and leading a happy and successful life without any support from men.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, when Dr Govinda KC was staging his 15th fast-unto-death demanding reforms in the medical sector, our former minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, Sher Bahadur Tamang, also pulled out the chhori/cheli trump card while casually talking about chhori/cheliharu in Bangladesh “losing their honors” by sleeping with teachers to earn their MBBS certificate. He had done no research and provided no facts to back this claim, and was possibly working just to promote his own agenda regarding medical schools. So not only is violence against women being brushed aside in a patronizing manner, it is also being used as a political tool.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing back to the notice, we have a classic example of victim-shaming. An official government document instructing women to be conscious of their own bodies and explicitly stating that a woman’s own action triggers rape. The notice completely ignores a woman’s right to befriend, talk to, or exchange pictures with whoever she chooses and instead follows the age-old narrative that what matters the most when you are a Nepali woman, is to live and die protecting this fragile and sacred thing called “family’s honor”. Why do we forget a Nepali woman has every right to share whatever personal, political or sexual content she wants to? I don’t see men being reprimanded for the exact same actions. Equally saddening is the fact that nobody is pointing out the absurdity of the notice. What we need is a notice that warns the perpetrators to change the way they behave, not the victims. A notice that would help create a secure environment for a woman to freely express herself. A notice which stresses that sweet-talking or exchanging pictures, even including nudes, is not an invitation to rape. A notice that encourages a safe culture of consent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe age of consent in Nepal is 18 years and getting involved in any sexual activity with someone under that age, even if they are willing, is considered rape. Consent means that not only must men stop when a woman says NO, but men must not proceed unless a woman says YES. This does not change even if two people are married or in a relationship. Do we teach this in schools or families in Nepal? Each month hundreds of marital rapes do not get reported as the body of a married Nepali woman supposedly becomes her husband’s property and women are conditioned in such a way that question of consent does not even come up.\\r\\n\\r\\nSex scenes in movies do not feature people asking for consent, leading people to assume the same in their daily life, especially in the South Asian communities. Amitabh Bachchan starrer Bollywood film Pink is a recent exception and is trying to draw India’s attention to the culture of consent. How effective it has been in doing that has yet to be seen but, at the very least, it is a step in the right direction. Hopefully Nepali entertainment industry will soon follow suit. It is also important to notice less extreme examples like sexist songs promoting slut-shaming which turn out to be the biggest hits. Admittedly, such examples do exist in Bollywood and Hollywood but the difference is that they have been receiving their share of criticism. But here, how many of us even notice that?\\r\\n\\r\\nI have seen the most intellectual women go quietly to the kitchen while men have conversations in the living room. I have gone to a restaurant and seen the menu being passed to a guy, deeming him to be the decision-maker. I have seen countless cases of mansplaining, men explaining things to women who are expected to just nod their heads for hours. I have heard a group of boys burst out into laughter on rape jokes, not realizing or simply not caring about the sensitivity of the subject. These are the subtle ways in which we take power away from women and accept a male-dominated order of society. Every time this happens, and nobody speaks against it, we take the first steps toward normalization of rape culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nStricter laws against rape are definitely needed and, with the enormous public pressure, inevitably are forthcoming. But that will just be the top of a pyramid whose base we are yet to build. How can we let men get away with catcalling and slut-shaming and then be certain they will not take the next step and attempt a rape? Bestowing all the power on men, we have promoted this culture of rape and now we cannot just punish one culprit and expect to stop all rapes. We all are culprits to have let the situation worsen to this extent and we all need to make amends. Working from the ground level to uplift the status of women in Nepal and making sure no action, no matter how small, that undermines women’s standing in the society as equal to that of men goes unchecked, should be the initial steps toward that atonement.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            The festivals we celebrate and the rituals we perform in the Kathmandu Valley are not just letting us revisit the past but these festivals are also reclaiming their position in today’s altered urban space. Yenya Punhi is one such festival that takes us back to Medieval Nepal and provides us the opportunity to relive the life of our ancestors. But in the meantime it is also redrawing its identity in the space that we have modified, to be a“modern city” which was created thousands of years back.But these aspects of intangible heritage – festivals, rituals, and practices which were started hundreds of years back continue to exist in the present changed and altered ancient city. Some of the rituals and festivals are being abandoned due to several reasons but we still have many, which we proudly celebrate. One of such festival is Yenya and let us look into some aspects of Yenya in today’s urban space and how it is still reminding us consciously or unconsciously of how we mark the present with the memories of the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nRaising of Yosi\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raising of Yosi, a long wooden pole made out of freshly cut tree every year, in the premises of Kathmandu’s Hanuman Dhoka Durbar Square, marks the official start of the festival. Yosi is raised not only in Yenya but also in different events and festivals throughout the Kathmandu Valley. Different researchers have different views regarding Yosi. Some say this is an axis mundi, connecting the heaven to the earth while some identify it as a sacrificial post. This Yosi raising ritual in front of Kageshwor temple on Bhadra sukla dwadashi was added much later by Pratap Singh Shah. There used to be Yosi in front of Atkonarayan temple by Malla king on the day of Bhadra shukla ekadashi before that. In addition to these Yosis there are also smaller Yosis of other Guthi during this festival but unfortunately many of these smaller rituals are fading away. Going back to the main Yosi, after it is brought from the forest of Nalaknown as “YosiGu” it is kept in Bhotahiti until the auspicious date and time is drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nYosi is placed at this place because it marks the outer boundary of the ancient Kathmandu. A small stone manda (mandap) that is hidden under the road during other days of the year is dug up and theYosi is placed in front of this manda which is worshipped in this place until it is taken inside the city. Prominent Sanskrit scholar and art historian Gautam Vajra Vajracharya mentions in his book “Hanuman Dhoka Rajdurbar” that the boundary of Rani Pokhari extended until the boundary of the city and the Malla kings would personally go to welcome Yosi up to their palace. The continuity for this ritual of welcoming Yosi by the king was changed with the king replaced by his sword, which is continued till date. Yosi is brought to the palace through the ancient trade route from the Bhotahiti through Ashon, Wongha, Makhan and then to the palace to raise the Yosi in front of Kageshwor temple. This route that passes diagonally through the city was economically important during the heydays of Valley due to flourishing trade between Tibet and India. Still this route is a shopping hotspot for the people of Kathmandu.\\r\\n\\r\\nDabu (Dabali)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile walking through the narrow lanes of ancient cities in the Kathmandu Valley, we would come across numerous square or rectangular shaped raised platforms all over the Valley which is known as dabu (dabali). Many platforms are seen occupied by tea stalls or vendors selling vegetables, while some have even made the permanent makeshift over these dabus making these structures go unnoticed. These dabus were not built just to fill the gaps in the urban space but have significant functions. These are the platforms designed for the performance of masked dances, plays and conducting rituals. One of the mask dances performed during Yenya is Devi Pyakaha, which is organized by the Jyapu Guthi of Kilagal. This dance is performed only on specific dabus throughout the festival. Unlike other dances that do not have fixed performing places and goes according to the invitation, Devi Pyakha strictly follows the route of Kumari Raath processions and is performed only on the specific dabu on the route. During the Yosi raising ceremony Devi Pyakha is also performed but just for a while without dabu.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the fourth day of the festival when Kumari’s chariot is in procession of the upper half of the city, Devi Pyakha is performed in the middle of the busy road without dabu. This place is the starting point of Shukrapath from Indra Chwork. This definitely raises everyone’s curiosity, “Why is this dance performed in the middle of the street?” and that too without dabu. The members of Devi Pyakah Guthi share the story that this place had a dabu before the earthquake of 1934 for the performance. Road was carved through dabu and other houses and monument which we do not know for certainty for now. Some historians claim that Kathmandu Hanuman Dhoka Durbar’s area extended to the place where now Bishal Bazzar stands. Even though we have lost the memory of this place, the festivities like Devi Pyakha are making them alive, and even remind us that, it is not these rituals that are encroaching upon our roads and hampering the daily activities but our so-called modern thinking and modern cities have encroached upon the identity our ancestors gave us.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpakhu\\r\\n\\r\\nUpakhu is the ritual where family of the deceased people on that year goes around the city (in clockwise direction) on the evening of Yosi raising day, placing the paalchha (butter lamp in the raw earthen bowl) along the path.This ritual is also known as Paalchha Biyounu – meaning to distribute or place paalchha. People also place paalchha on the shrines and temples on the way and even offer paalchha to some relatives who happen to be watching the procession. This light from the lamp is believed to show the way to the deceased people’s spirits to the heaven, and this procession wards off evil spirits from the city. Local Guthi members with traditional music also join the procession. The locality of this route welcomes people participating in the procession by cleaning and decorating their place and temples as well as placing a huge heap of samaye baji.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to well-known art historian and anthropologist author Mary Slusser, Kathmandu used to have a wall around the city and people on that day still follow the boundary where the wall stood. With the fall of the city wall after the Gorkhali invasion in Kathmandu, people have lost the sense of boundaries as well but the ritual, which we continue, still reminds of the old boundaries. It is still common to refer the newer settlements outside of ancient city boundary as desha pine meaning outside of the city. Older generations believed that impure and evil spirits reside outside of the city boundary while the city area remains pure. This might be one of the reasons that the mask dances of this festival of Kathmandu go outside of the old city boundary and when asked they mention they are not allowed to cross the river. Settlements were concentrated in the old city surrounded by the vast green fields for a very long time. This reason of impurity protected the fertile land of Kathmandu Valley avoiding the rampant construction of houses unlike today.\\r\\n\\r\\nKumari, Ganesh and Bhairav Rath Procession\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the major highlights of this festival is the chariot procession of the Kumari, Ganesh and Bhairav along the city. The procession takes place for three days, in three different routes. The procession on the fourth day of the Yenya is marked red in the calendar as “Indra Jatra” as the head of state and various national and foreign dignitaries come to observe the festival on this day. The route of the chariot on this day is along the lower half of the ancient city and known as Koneyaa meaning procession through the lower half. On the fifth day the procession takes place through the upper half of the city and known as Thane yaa. While on the last day of the festival, the procession covers the small area and is believed to be added much later. These processions on the fourth and fifth day still mark invisible and informal old boundaries of the city, as ancient Kathmandu was divided in two parts: the upper part from Thamel to durbar as Thane and the lower part form Lagan to Maru. The people of Kathmandu still refer to these places as Thane and Kwone. Now this demarcation does not appear in any of the formal geographical distribution of the city plan but exists in the everyday conversation while referring to the places by the Newars of Kathmandu. The ancient rituals are validating the notion of the space people still have.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are just a few examples of the festivals and festivities which reinforce the city’s identity in modern urban space. Age-old traditions are making the spaces alive and giving meaning to the place. “God does not play dice,” goes a famous quote from Einstein. \\xa0Our ancestors also did not play dice while planning and decorating the city. Not a single stone is placed in the valley without reasons and meaning behind them.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany times when we have ceased to give continuity to these types of rituals or festivals, then we lose the functions of the space or structures and then think these structures are nuisances. These traditions are the soul of the city and in these festivals, its spirits come to revisit the place even when there is no trace of the built structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author is researcher at CIDEHUS – Centro Interdisciplinar de História, Culturas e Sociedades da Universidade de Évora, Portugal.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            Death penalty has been one of the most debated topics in recent days. Rape cases have been reported more than ever now and it seems that the only way to deter such abominable crime is reinstatement of death penalty. But how practical is the proposed solution?\\r\\n\\r\\nJust because an idea, an instinct seems good doesn\\'t necessarily mean it is right. Do certain crimes deserve death penalty? The answer, for me, is a tentative Yes. Heinous rape, murder, assault may deserve one. But is death penalty the solution? It is an emphatic No.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it because I sympathize with the rapists and think they deserve a second chance at life? The answer again is an emphatic No. Any person who finds it in him/herself to destroy the life of another person has already lost that chance. You don\\'t have to rape or murder someone to know it\\'s wrong. Rapists must be either castrated or even hanged or killed. That\\'s my stance on rape and always will be.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut is capital punishment practical? No. Because,\\r\\n\\r\\n1) It provides too much power to the state. And if the state can\\'t provide life, it shouldn\\'t have the authority to take it.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) There\\'s always the chance of an innocent being executed. You would be fine with the death of an innocent as long as 99 other perpetrators are executed as long as that innocent person is not related to you. But ‘It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer’ goes the Blackstone’s formulation about criminal law and we are talking about death penalty here.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) DNA evidence isn\\'t always foolproof.\\xa0 You shed your DNA everywhere you go and therefore your DNA can land in places of crimes scenes even if you have never been there. Sometimes forensic investigators themselves contaminate the evidence accidently. Adam Scott was wrongfully convicted of rape due to a blunder in a British forensic laboratory. Despite his claims of being more than 200 miles away at the time of incident, he was detained for months on the basis of DNA matching before being exonerated. He was deemed to be \"innocent victim of avoidable contamination\" and \"human error\" by a British forensic science regulator\\r\\n\\r\\nThere have been numerous cases of people being wrongly executed in the past. Carlos Deluna, Ruben Cantu, Cameron Todd Willingham and many other people have been convicted by the court and later executed but the evidences on which such convictions were based on turned out to be compromised. Bringing a life back from the dead to correct the state\\'s mistake or forensic contamination isn\\'t possible and these men, along with many others lost their lives because of something they didn\\'t commit. They didn\\'t get a second chance to appeal.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany others have later been exonerated on newly gathered evidences. Just some days back, there was a news report about a man convicted of raping a girl being exonerated after 13 and half years! Death penalty might seem like the ultimate deterrent against all crimes but there have been no available evidence to support that claim. The Great Britain (1973), Canada (1976), France (1981), Australia (1985), Italy (1994) and Spain (1995), among others, have eliminated capital punishment for murder after extensive study and debate.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe alternative to the capital punishment is imprisonment until the person dies with no chance of parole. And maybe also publicly parading them on streets. I have no problem with any brutal treatment to rapists but if found innocent, they must be compensated as such and that should also be made public.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, considering rape as an emotional urgency is utterly nonsense. If that is so then it should be okay for girls on their periods to go on a killing spree because we cannot control what\\'s natural no? If emotions are an excuse then doing things in a fit of anger should be excusable as well. Is it? Should I steal things if I like them and I can\\'t control my desire? People are responsible for their feelings and therefore must take full responsibility for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnderstanding the reason for rape should be done from the ground level. It may be because of culture, environment and lack of education. These should be dealt with properly at the grassroots. Democracy will be in crisis if people feel their elected leaders aren\\'t coping well with issues like these. Framing of innocent people either to protect criminals or due to fear of them has already strained the confidence of people on their government officials. It should now be the task of these people in power to do everything they can without giving in to pressure and influence from external forces and uphold justice in the country.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nDespite continuous warnings from environmentalists and scientists alike, the inevitable has happened. It is the year 2030 and climate change has taken a toll on our environment. One article in Setopati reads, “2030: Hottest Year Ever Recorded”, another one reads “Uncertain Weather Patterns, Intense and Frequent Heat Waves to Follow”. Global temperature rise has exceeded over 2°C above pre-industrial levels and is projected to rise further. Rain is uncertain and water is scarce. Soil compaction and the consequent increase in pests and weeds, amongst others, have shown substantial effect on agricultural production of food crops. Once famed as the food basket of Nepal, the Terai region is now limited to subsistence farming. Drought and water shortage have already claimed lives of hundreds of farmers and people live in chaos as these dreadful impacts have threatened our very existence. \\nAs much as this sounds like a setting of a science fiction, this is soon to happen, considering the minimal effort being put into mitigating the already-felt effects of climate change. If you find this scenario alarming, then actions are necessary. \\nThe foremost effects of climate change are evident here in the Hindu Kush Himalayas, and with amplified intensity. As industrial growth and subsequent carbon emissions continue to ravage our planet, the mountainous region remains to be the most vulnerable. The Himalayas do not only support tourism business but also regulate the monsoon circulation pattern, a change in which will alter the water cycle and can bring about devastating effects like long-term droughts and heavy floods. The changing weather pattern in these areas is a clear indication of the ongoing climate change, and a warning that if these effects are not tackled at the soonest, dire consequences will follow.\\nBut our government does not seem to be competent in addressing these issues, let alone combating them. The fact that the government spent almost 100 times in the import of fossil fuel than on environment and forestry sector (Rs 1.6 trillion on the import of fossil fuel vs Rs 16.5 billion allocated in the budget for the environment and forestry sector development) is sufficient to know about the status and trend of environment conservation and management in Nepal. \\nThe consequences of further prolonging the import and use of fossil fuels are dire and it is high time the government understood that a long term plan is necessary to steadily cut out the dependency on non-renewable resources. For this, the government should have a detailed knowledge regarding the energy consumption pattern of Nepal and develop projects that focus on diluting the nonrenewable energy use. Further, it should increase its investment in projects that foster climate resilience and cut greenhouse gas emissions. \\nProjects focused on hydropower development, agro-forestry development, environment conservation and management, eco-tourism promotion, processing and sales of high value local environment-friendly products, amongst many can prove to be the mainstays of the Nepali economy while contributing significantly to environment conservation initiatives. In addition to these, the government should formulate and enforce policies for maximum utilization of alternative energy sources in the industrial and transportation sector. Only after establishing renewable energy sources as a prominent alternative, can the government advance toward undertaking measures for rapid reduction in use of fossil fuels.\\xa0 \\nMoreover, Nepal’s recent shift to a federal system demands state-level action plans to prioritize the balance in environmental needs and capacity. Planned urbanization, state subsidies for less carbon emitting industries, and investments in the design and adaptation of alternative energy strategies should be made by every state government.\\nAt this stage, the government cannot single-handedly cope with the consequences of what has been done and therefore it is crucial that the government understands and implements the principle of public-private partnership to curb further damages to the environment in its endeavor of preserving the environment for this generation and the generations to come.\\nIn addition to this, every single being should realize the urgency of now—a spiel that has often been repeated, but one that has to be reiterated—because if there is any momentous time for climate-related actions to take place, the time is now. Only then can we be guided toward a better future, and someday, we can likely face the following scenario:\\nContrary to popular opinion, millennials have put in collaborative efforts and successfully subsided the severe consequences of climate change. It is the year 2030, the US is finally rejoining the Paris Agreement, over a decade after the Donald Trump administration left the agreement. On the occasion of World Environment Day, Setopati has published an editorial commemorating the commitment of nations around the globe that has helped avoid the adverse effects. An article in the news portal reads “Nepal, Now a Carbon-Negative Country”. We have finally met the “Stay Below 1.5°C Goal” which was once deemed unachievable by skeptics and we can now be certain of the survival of species, previously categorized endangered, in years to come.\\nAt this dawn of a new decade, it is upon us to decide which of the two scenarios we intend to bring, because, after all, it is us who have the capacity to bring about the change we desire.\\nManandhar is an environmentalist.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            Walking through the old cities inside the Kathmandu Valley even after rapid urbanization, concretization rather, we still see the amazing remains of the past. Some objects, temples, houses, lanes or windows staring and waiting to tell the stories of its glorious past. One of them is the magnificent wooden window in a simple house at Nardevi known as “Deshemaru Jhya”.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe literal translation of “Deshemaru Jhya” is\\xa0“only once piece in the whole country” and as the name says the window in the house of\\xa0Yetkha\\xa0is only of its kind in the whole country. It is really interesting as well as mysterious to see a wonderful piece of art in a normal looking house. Even before the rebuilding of this house in a modern style, it was just an ordinary Newar house. Therefore, some local people even claim that the way of saying “Deshemaru” was a sarcastic way of telling “showoff”.\\r\\n\\r\\nActually this window is a blind window without opening and this type of window is mostly used in the first floor of the Newar house, known as “Tikki Jhyaa”. Normally these types of windows are plain-looking with the lattices so that it gives privacy in the room\\xa0refraining from outsiders to look inside while from inside through the holes the outside view is possible. Mostly the windows in the second floors of traditional houses are richer and lavishly decorated and known as “Saa Jhyaa” with the open access. In contrast to the normal\\xa0Tiki Jhyaa\\xa0this one is designed with multiple frames – one overlapping the other with a total of eleven frames and in the center is lattice, providing the three-dimensional look.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile much information is not available regarding its origin or how the plain-looking house ended up having such an amazing art. Even many tourists come to have a look at this outstanding piece of art, according to the shopkeeper in the house Rico Sthapit as is featured in the tourist guidebook. But neither he nor the owner of the house has much details regarding the window.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the window there is a piece of wooden plate with some text and number written as Yet Tor Nambar (7)9 and according to Prof.\\xa0Kashinath Tamot it means Yetakhaatolayaa 79 lyaayaachhen – 79 house number of Yetkhaa. It was the census of the houses done during the Rana time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis window not only tells the story of the glorious past but also the present – the state of heritage conservation of Nepal. Despite being an example of excellent craftsmanship, it is not in a proper condition now. The window is in a concrete house where it’s clamped with the cement while wooden pieces are in the phase of deterioration. The room with that window is now leased by a tuition institute. Neither the owner of the house nor the government seems to be giving attention to the famed window.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to some locals, the government wanted to take that window when the house owner was rebuilding the house. But the owner opposed and in order to avoid the Department of Archeology claiming the window, the owner built the house with the window hanging and then built the wall over it. If the authorities responsible had managed to pursue the house owner to build the house in a traditional manner, the fate of the window would have been different. In addition to that we must also consider the fact that heritage conservation then was mostly guided by the objects and antiquities and they had not embraced the holistic way of heritage conservation. But the irony is almost decades later the mindset of the authorities does not seem to change.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is clear that nothing has been done for conservation of the “Deshyamaru Jhyaa” but everyone of us carry it in our Nepali passport page number 25.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe author is researcher at CIDEHUS - Centro Interdisciplinar de História, Culturas e Sociedades da Universidade de Évora, Portugal.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            When I was a teenager, I remember an old man telling me, “Finding your soul mate gives you the greatest joy.” I was of the belief that this joy certainly comes to everyone, for soul mate is someone with whom one gets married, and (nearly) everyone gets married at one point.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver time, though, I have come to realize that the idea of soul mate is not necessarily related to the idea of marriage (even when partners are chosen by each other). Just the contrary, for many individuals, marriage often puts an end to that quest for soul mate, or someone with whom one can have a purely platonic relationship. Especially in a society like Nepal’s, any relationship between two individuals of opposite sex outside their marriage is almost restricted by unspoken societal norms. It is extremely rare for a married woman to have a very close male friend, or for the married man to have a close female friend. When existing, such relationships are despised and derided by society. Indeed, most people fear to explore their life after they tie the knot.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome important questions spring up amid this backdrop. Should getting married necessarily lead an individual, as it happens in most cases, to build a rigid enclosure around oneself that restricts him/her from exploring his/her life and finding individuals with whom one can have a purely platonic relationship? Should soul mate necessarily be the person with whom one is married to? If some relationship exists other than marriage that offers intellectual growth, a sense of fulfillment on purely platonic terms, should one hesitate to pursue such relationship?\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, relationships of love (between unmarried couples) and marriage are viewed as being the manifestations of the idea of soul mates. And so, one needs to understand the relationship between love, marriage, and soul mate or platonic love to answer the above questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nRelationships of love has some core elements to it. The need to be physically near to one’s partner, the idea of loyalty, or the vow to remain loyal to one’s partner are central to this relationship. Sexual element is another crucial element. Sexual fulfillment is considered a plausible expectation on part of one’s partner. And any interpersonal difference that might arise could well lead to the termination of the relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarriage, at least in theory, is no different from this in terms of the elements. Marriage is a social contract that gets legal recognition, and is a largely a binding relationship. In contrast to love relationship and marriage, platonic love, the love the soul mates share, transcends the definition of infatuation and love. It also does not necessarily have to be socially sanctioned relationship like the marriage. Physical proximity is not necessarily a prerequisite of a relationship of soul mate. In fact, the individuals in such a relationship need not even be together physically or even near. All that is required is having a sense of the vive and ambience of the person.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoul mate is, therefore, a relationship that can exist outside of one’s love or marriage relationships. For example, one could be happily married with an individual, but have different individual as his/her soul mate. Love does not necessarily confine to the small periphery of the husband-wife, boyfriend-girlfriend or couple relationship, but rather the idea of greater love, perhaps more unselfish platonic love is something that can be expanded outside the existing couple relationship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to understand that just because a person finds a soul mate in a different person doesn’t mean that he or she is betraying the husband or wife. Soul mate can be a friend, a professor, or anyone of any age or gender. The main part is that soul mates are your well-wishers and do not have any vested interest over your body, possession or anything else. It is the relationship where contentment is found in respecting the other, wishing good about the other and in engaging intellectual conversations. Marriage, therefore, should not be the end of the road when it comes to building relationships, more specifically finding one’s soul mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, in the ‘busy’, impatient contemporary society of today guided by capitalist mode of life than anything else, people lack patience to even understand the meaning of soul mate. Yet, it would make our life more intellectually fulfilling and enriched in overall sense if individuals can break free of the belief system that marriage or love relationships are end to any relationships, and stay open to finding the soul mate in its true sense.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Bhattarai is an Assistant Professor at the Kathmandu University Department of Music)\\n',\n",

When it dies, all those information that were stored in the stack, can be reimplanted into a new sleeve.\\r\\n\\r\\nSay for example, sleeve A is an actor. When the actor dies, the stack has all the information of that actor. After sleeve A dies, that stack is transferred into sleeve B, who is a businessman. When the businessman dies, the stack now has the information of both the actor and the businessman. Now it is put into a new sleeve C, who is a carpenter. When the carpenter dies, the stack then has the information of the actor, the businessman and the carpenter. Let\\'s say sleeve D is a doctor and sleeve E is an engineer. Though this stack has now managed to have so much of information in store even if it is put into a new sleeve, ordinarily the function of that sleeve will not necessarily be the manifestation of the entire information stored in it and will have limited functionality. So, despite having so much of information in the stack the sleeve may just live a life as a teacher and not be able to translate the information in the crevices of the stack to act like an engineer or a doctor at the time of need. But the question is: is it at all possible? The answer is yes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow let us for a minute assume that sleeve is equal to a body and stack is equal to a soul. Meaning Body: Soul:: Sleeve: Stack.\\r\\n\\r\\nContrary to the fictional placement of a stack in the vertebra at the back of the neck, it is not an easy task to define the position of a soul in a human body. It can be diffusely integrated into the entire construct of a body in the form of conscious energy. With meditation one may be able to reduce it back to its innate physiological nature that in its state of ultimate purity is capable of emanating light. Else, at the time of death, depending upon the level of your spiritual attainment, you may wake up in subtler physical forms in this plane, or other ethereal planes and attain various degrees of soul realization.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoul realization is possible prior to death by means of meditation or various forms of yoga. Soul realization may not directly translate into absolute enlightenment, if there is any experience of such nature, but it is certainly one of the steps in the pathway of enlightenment. As someone rightly mentioned, there are degrees of enlightenment. While the distinction between awakening and enlightenment itself is a little murky, I consider the term \"degrees of enlightenment\" to be a better expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you can comprehend the possibility of stack migration from one sleeve to the other, can you contemplate transmigration then?\\r\\n\\r\\nTransmigration, meaning migration of soul from one body to the other. In my earlier life, I was a\\xa0 musician. In this life I am a neurosurgeon. In the other life, I am going to become a warrior. My soul is keeping the memory of my past, present and the gamut of future experiences too. So if I attain soul realization in this life means, that I will be able to operate not only as a neurosurgeon, but I will also be able to play piano like Beethoven or fight a battle like Alexander, in this very life itself. My soul has been moving from one body to the other body in various planes of existence, over various timelines. My soul. It has got everything in reserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then comes the most important realization, probably more important than soul realization itself. Is our body merely a sleeve? The answer is no.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf and when soul gets access into the body, is yet another debate. But for all practical purposes, let us assume that soul enters the body at the time of fertilization. So in my making there are two important components: the zygote from my parents, and the soul that enters into it: the sum of which is me. I am a function of my soul, my father\\'s gene and my mother\\'s gene. My father\\'s gene is a function of his soul and the genes of my paternal grandparents. My mother\\'s gene is a function of her soul and the genes of my maternal grandparents. This very well explains why a body is not just the function of a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nA laboratory synthesized sleeve may apparently appear inferior to the stack but a naturally born human body is not. This is why the eastern tradition puts so much emphasis into yoga, meaning yoking of body and mind; mind here being the direct function of a soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe choice between a stack and a soul is also the choice between the Christ and the beast. It is for you to realize who offers you a stack and who offers you a soul.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe internet has\\xa0given opportunity for people to broadcast their message out to the world, whether it is blogging to showcase their writing talent or YouTube to create video content. Podcasting, however, is gaining popularity among many content creators lately. It gives power to every individual to become a broadcaster and share the message out to the world.\\nPodcast is any digital (mostly audio or video) content uploaded on the internet as an episodic show that could be streamed online or downloaded on device such as phone, tablet or laptop and are available on the internet anytime. The beauty of podcast lies in the fact that you don’t need to be listening it live as is the case for radio shows. Podcasts have narrow topics and targeted audiences which makes it super-niche thing.\\nPodcasting has history dating back to 2004 when Adam Curry and Dave Winer from the United States first became successful in enclosing audio in RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feeds. Since then there has been slow gradual growth in podcast listeners and creators. However, a criminal investigation podcast called Serial that investigated the murder case of Hae Min Lee, a US high school girl made podcast a household name in the US in 2014. In 2013, Apple reported reaching 1 billion downloads of podcasts on its platform iTunes which still remains the major platform for podcast consumption. Today there are over 200,000 Podcasts in Apple directory in 14 different categories such as arts, technology and politics in many different languages.\\nListeners can easily find and listen to podcasts on the topic of their interest. There are podcasts about football matches to cooking recipes. There is an inbuilt app on iPhone called Apple Podcasts and several apps such as podcast addict and Castbox are available for android users. Listeners can find at least a dozen of podcasts on the topic of their interest in these podcast apps. Once they find the podcast they are searching for, they can listen in by streaming online or download for later consumption. It has been found that many listeners listen to podcasts during travelling, jogging, doing daily chores, etc. This is a major benefit with audio content as you cannot watch videos or read blog articles everywhere.\\nIt is very easy to start a podcast for any creator. All one need is a message to share, a microphone to record and an editing software to edit audio. To begin with, one can use inbuilt microphone of his/her own phone or laptop and the best recording and editing software Audacity is completely free to download and use. It has very simple interface and one can learn editing using Audacity easily as there are hundreds, if not thousands, of tutorials available on YouTube. Once they have their first episode ready, they can submit their show to iTunes and other directories for approval. Once these directories approve your show, you can now publish episodes every week or day depending on your content publishing schedule.\\nBijay Gautam is Producer and Host of The Inspiring Talk podcast.

       "  \"\\n                            History of Nepal-India relations can best be described in terms of its asymmetric behavior. The influence exerted by Indian establishment can be analyzed using a newly emerged concept in international relations i.e. sharp power. Concept of sharp power has emerged lately and was for the first time used by American scholar Joseph S. Nye to describe new attitude of influential states in conduct of their external affairs. Sharp power includes the tactics of pressure, bullying and deception as means to control international affairs. The new influx of the concept of sharp power in international relations claims emerging influential states use power both in form of coercion and persuasion at the same time. India-Nepal relationship off late has offered ground to justify the very existence of sharp power in Asian order as one of the major techniques to gain strategic benefits in asymmetric relations.\\r\\nThe post 2015 Nepal-India relationship has suffered largely because of India's continuous engagement into mainstream political concerns of the Nepali state. India's cunning and deceptive interest came to the fore for the first time when Indian foreign secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Nepal on the eve of promulgation of Constitution of Nepal. In his visit, he tried to persuade the then Nepali government not to promulgate Constitution citing major flaws. Nepal, however, remained firm over its stand and ultimately denied Indian request for delay in pronouncing its much awaited constitution to the world. India followed by imposing blockade which further escalated tensions between the two states. India's sharp power was witnessed as they never called it an official blockade and also denied the claim by Nepal in international community by citing reasons of unrest in Madhesh as major problem for them to exercise caution in sending Indian vehicles carrying goods and supplies to Nepal.\\nThe Indian blockade which lasted for four months paralyzed the economy that had already suffered the devastating effects of earthquake. India still remains reluctant in reviewing the Treaty of Peace and Friendship signed in 1950 despite the Nepali members of the Eminent Persons Group on Nepal-India relations advocating for necessary changes. India has offered to respect sovereignty of Nepal on numerous occasions but unfortunately it has always used sharp power on Nepal most of the times. The Nepali state has been ineffective in altering major problems related to Nepal-India relations. When Nepal signed agreement with China to become part of Belt and Road Initiative, India complained their security concerns have been compromised.\\nIn a recent development India has promised to help the left alliance in development projects. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has offered to CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli to work in partnership for common prosperity.\\nThe Madheshi faction which still remains an important factor has in this regard become a tool of India's sharp power. India has convinced them to become a part of coalition government to be formed under the leadership of Oli to ensure Indian voice in Nepali government. The Madhesh-based parties earlier declared they will not be part of government unless constitutional amendment is guaranteed but in a political u-turn they seem to have been convinced as per the desire of India.\\nNow that the Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has landed in Kathmandu, it has once again stirred the political system of the country. The visit signifies various implications and major changes and is seen to be another untimely high-profile visit considering that the election of National Assembly and formation of new government are just around the corner.\\nIndia's sharpness can be witnessed as it recognizes major threats that can be imposed by the next government. India seems to be bothered by Nepal's efforts for an equidistant foreign policy with India and China and growing Chinese influence in Nepal, and the issues may dominate Swaraj's visit and dialogue with political leaders. The visit may influence new political order but if it happens it will only hamper the Nepali interest in the longer run.\\nHistory clearly indicates India has failed to deliver on most of its promises which remains symbolic and deceptive in nature. India will for now offer economic and political help but as soft power dynamics of Indian foreign policy. But it will ultimately turn out to become a bargaining tool in case Nepali leaders fall into the trap. The sharpness of Indian interest has to be realized in order to assure new Nepali decisions do not provoke sentiments of other influencing partners of Nepal. The stage is set for Nepal to welcome foreign minister of India wholeheartedly but they must be able to recognize what changes the visit might persuade. The newly adopted constitution provides ample space for Nepal to adjust India into its development scheme but they must remain skeptical about allowing any such\\xa0Indian interest which can hinder Nepal's economic goal.\\n\",\n",
       "  '\\n                            K-Pop a Korean music genre which is popular worldwide due to its audio visual elements is slowly pumping into the heart of Nepali youth too. It has made a quantum leap from a national sensation through regional trends to semi-global phenomena.\\r\\n\\r\\nA rapid growth of Korean popular cultures has rapidly expanded across many parts of the world since the late 1990s. K-Pop has recently entered the dictionary of global popular cultures. Due to its new brand of popular music that is characterized by, among other things, the visual appeal of its idols and performance, as well as significant degree of musical conservatism, it has captivated millions of fans across the world and drawn the attention of the international media.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn case of Nepal, audiences have long lost patience with Western and Indian products that are saturated with violence, drugs, patriarchy and obscenity. The mounting discontent with the Western and Indian media content – television dramas, rap music, warmongering\\xa0video games, etc has initiated a quest for “clean” alternatives. The vacuum was an enormous boon to the Korean cultural industry. Nepali youths, in shortage of locally produced programs of decent quality, began turning to the Korean option, known for ideological and ethical soundness on top of agility in whipping up a cocktail for the best ingredients from Western and Indian programs\\r\\n\\r\\nKathmandu is also known as K-Town in fashion industry and among a new generation of Nepali youths. Korean brands of clothes and cosmetic products are visible everywhere in Kathmandu’s shopping stores. Now Korean products are in high demand among high school and college-going teenagers of Kathmandu.\\r\\n\\r\\nHigh school and college-going teenagers of Kathmandu believe, K-Pop performers deliver a sense of modesty and restraint, and insist on working hard and learning more during public appearances, something Western pop artistes do not do. K-Pop music represents a new, colorful and cheerful start, and not an old order, something that will easily appeal to a large number of youths, living in places where economic challenges are rife and political instability common.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Nepal, through decades of political conflict, people have had their fill of edginess and anguish. Youths don’t have anything like K-Pop.\\xa0 The Korean songs make them dance and smile.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in K-Town’s main places like New Road, Durbar Square and Sundhara, \"BTS has released new song. It was out of this world\".\\xa0“Yeah, I watched. it was fabulous!\" are regular conversation among group of young school and college-going students, all of whom follow Korean bands fervently. Names of South Korean actors, singers and bands roll easily off their tongue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe\\xa0Korean Wave, a term that was coined in mid-1999 and refers to spread of popular\\xa0Korean culture\\xa0comprising music, movies and drama, is slowly making its presence felt all over Nepal.\\xa0Today, Korean channels like Arirang TV and KBS are aired by the cable operators in Nepal. Recently South Korean Embassy in Nepal arranged one event where fans met with K-Pop stars. It saw a huge turnout with new generation youths flocking up to meet popular Korean band EXCO.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a lot of reasons why the \\'K-word\\' is becoming popular among the Nepali youths, despite the fact that most of the shows and songs are in Korean. Due to the long-term dull taste of Indian music, movies and recently developing anti-Indian sentiments after the Indian blockade and interference on internal political matters, the youths have developed hatred toward Indian movies, songs and led them to follow K-Pop.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother significant thing contributing to popularity of Korean culture in Nepal is EPS Korean program. Every year thousands of youths take classes of Korean language and go to South Korea for employment. According to a data revealed by the Nepali Embassy in South Korea as of March end 2016, there were 28,010 Nepalese nationals living there. Similarly, Mongolian youths of Nepal feel\\xa0physical and cultural affinity with Koreans. Due to refreshingly different contents Nepali youths buy CDs and DVDs of Korean dramas, movies and songs, and CD-DVD stores in the city give a special slot for display of Korean movies, dramas and songs. Unlike Indian dramas, Korean TV dramas are not about scheming mother-in-laws and traditional Indian family system. Instead, many of them feature struggles of young boys and girls and their success in finding their place in the world. The easy availability of shows on the internet, which help\\xa0 Nepali K-Pop lovers for downloading Korean TV series, songs and movies.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Korean complex is not just limited to music, movies and TV. It is also getting into youth fashion in Nepal. It is common for high school and college-going teenagers to get hairstyle and dress of their favorite K-Pop stars. Even hair saloons of Kathmandu have been sporting Korean style for a long time now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWorld K-Pop festival is another program which is getting popular by the year among teenagers of Kathmandu. Different participants compete in singing and dancing.\\xa0 Winner of this festival represents Nepal in the final world K-Pop festival in South Korea. It is one of the programs organized by South Korean ministry of foreign affairs with the support of numerous government agencies for promoting Korean culture worldwide. This also attracts the younger generation of Nepal toward the Korean culture. Teenagers in school of Kathmandu, unlike past ones who used to talk about Indian movies, songs and stars, now talk about the new Korean songs, movies and stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nSTRUKPOP, Mongolian Namja etc are dance groups continuously uploading cover dance of K-Pop on YouTube and promoting K-Pop among K-Pop lovers after representing Nepal in the final of global K-Pop festival.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow due to rapid development of information technology and easy access of the youths to the internet, Korean culture is growing rapidly particularly in urban areas of Nepal. It will certainly give a huge challenge to Nepali culture, and currently dominating Indian and Western culture.\\r\\n\\r\\nemail:\\xa0Jkafle15@gmail.com\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n                            Most of my art pieces were an aftermath of my anxiety ridden days. The paint drips and the coffee sips. These are all it takes for one to be an artist. I thought. Yet, I see so many other people have carved images so heavenly, and turned pieces of paper into sketches worth millions. Those people had a purpose. A purpose lot more than a sunny day with bird chirps. Something superior than the bitter coffee and sugary cake.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile those people already had their muse, I struggled to find mine.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut whenever I got to pause this man-made construct of time, I flew away to the basement of my house where I would remain unbothered for days. For me the basement was the most treasured part in the house. Oh! Not the spider webs that sparkled when a gleam of ray passed through the rusty ventilator. Definitely not the cracked easel that had a hint of glitter I sneezed and blew over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlas, the acrylics on the palette had gotten harder over time just because how lazy I was. Yet, I loved to be amidst the fragrance of the freshly opened paint containers. Dancing along to John Mayer holding my brushes as my counterparts, and the music reverberating through the wooden walls would make it my acoustic dream. Except, the basement was also a part garage where all my inventions were showcased right above the metal rack. All these formed an aesthetic environment for creating a masterpiece, my masterpiece.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some things in life that needs to be done to stay alive. But art, for me, merely sustained it. While I was studying those bulky physics books at\\xa03 am, I needed to doodle on the pages, or draw cartoons on the edges. The entropy of the world was ever increasing but the chaos within me lowered this way. I witnessed shades of black that would put every color to shame.\\xa0 The stains of coffee on the American cartridge. The charcoal dust that refuse to leave my fingers. The matt black nail polish that brings out the devil in me. It absorbed the colors yet let me reflect my true self. Meanwhile, I turned the hollow canvas to the vessel of my soul. The texture of the cartridge covering the wood mesmerizes me into reflection.\\r\\n\\r\\nPeople often mistake a muse to be a prop of an artistic person. But this muse for me proved to be a ray of hope, not just to fill up a canvas but to fill up my life with something worthwhile. Things started changing as if the drops of paint carried a sudden consciousness. I realized shortly that my muse was always there. All in front of me and all over me. In the same cup of coffee that burnt my tongue. Or the sugary cake that melted as soon as it entered my mouth. I figured my muse and the best part was it was the eternal kind. Not like the sweet teen romance and definitely not like the smoke rings we blew. However, for a split second I found myself enjoying without expecting a fine result. Evidently, this is how stuff are to be done. Not for the likes of Instagram or the views of Snapchat. When you place your motivation on the wrong place, it is likely to get stale. The key thus is to go to places that rejuvenate you, listen to stories that inspire you and do things that challenge you. Once you start gaining a sense of wonder in the smallest of things, you start to find your muse in the weirdest of places, I promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nPant is an\\xa0IBDP graduate.\\xa0\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nI did not have any opportunity of flying abroad until 22.07.2017. I was really excited as I was traveling to Denmark with my boyfriend to attend his brother’s wedding. We had planned this trip for a long time after being granted Schengen Visa, and everything was going without a hitch. This was my very first flight to a foreign country and I intended to make it a memorable one. So, my excitement was boundless.\\nOur flight was very early and we reached Tribhuvan International Airport, the only international airport in Nepal, around 5:30am. As I stood in the queue approaching the immigration officer’s desk, I noticed one of the immigration officers stopping a girl who was traveling to Switzerland alone. He was rudely asking her to wait in the corner.\\nWhen my turn came, I gave him my passport and explained to him why I was going to Denmark. He asked me to show the actual invitation card for the wedding. When I informed him that I only had a soft copy of the invitation card stored in my laptop, he disapproved and responded in the harshest manner possible asking me to wait in the corner until he finished checking other passengers’ passports.\\nAs I was waiting, I noticed him being extra rude to passengers traveling to India claiming that there was no point in traveling to India if it was not related to work or health. He was disruptive and disturbingly annoying. I waited for more than 45 minutes before I was finally referred to two other immigration officers who turned out to be worse than the previous one.\\nDespite having a valid visa to travel, I had to experience disgusting verbal abuse for 15 minutes from the three immigration officers. The questions they asked me were unnecessary, very personal and a far cry from the questions that are meant to be asked by the immigration officers under unclear situations only. I had a clear case of visa grant regardless of whether or not I was carrying the actual invitation card. Besides, I had no idea if I was even supposed to carry or show the invitation to Nepal’s immigration as I would have expected such requirement only at the Denmark immigration, if they demanded. I had no idea why they were even demanding it or why they were not accepting a soft copy and if there were any such airport or immigration rules for it. I had not been previously informed or warned about such rigorous and ridiculous demands at the point of departure.\\nThe series of questions I was being asked were beyond my belief. I was asked unrelated and appalling personal questions such as:\\nBeing a girl, how I dared traveling alone?\\nWhy am I traveling with a foreigner?\\nWhy didn’t I marry him (my boyfriend) before traveling?\\nWhat if he is a kidnapper?\\nHow can my parents be so shameless for letting me travel alone with a foreigner?\\nThey even asked me totally irrelevant questions about my education. When I told them I had completed my bachelors level studies, they demanded me to produce my student ID card which had expired last year. I told them I don’t carry expired student ID card to which they cynically responded that I’m supposed to walk around with my expired student ID so that people would know that I was a student once.\\nThey were enjoying watching how uncomfortable I was feeling. My boyfriend requested me to keep calm because he knew if I snapped at them, they wouldn’t let me travel with him.\\nI was repeatedly mocked and asked demeaning questions about whether I had passed or failed my bachelor’s level which was uncannily followed by their humiliating laughter. Before eventually letting me go, one of the officers accusingly mentioned that my parents had failed to teach me how to respect the elders.\\nHe justified their disparaging previous interrogation as important part of safety because if something happened to me while I was traveling, he would be the one to rescue me and if something went amiss, he would lose his job.\\n\\xa0At that very moment I was thinking who were held responsible for the dead bodies that come inside the coffin everyday at Tribhuvan International Airport? Why didn’t these immigration officers rescue those people before it was too late if they were so-called moral guards? How could they be so ignorant and shameless? I so wanted to ask this particular officer that blunt question but the fear that he would not let me go stopped me.\\nThree immigration officers made me feel naked, exposed, vulnerable and weak just because I was a young, single girl traveling with a foreign boyfriend. I felt abused by their intimidating and condescending behavior, and felt betrayed by the trusted authorities. For me they were not immigration officers, they were verbal and psychological abusers.\\nI don’t think they would have been relentless in asking those same irrelevant questions to my brother if he were traveling with his girlfriend instead. I know all this happened only because I am a girl from a country where patriarchy and misogyny is an accepted culture, and society is strongly male-dominated\\nWho will take action against such abuses which I and so many other women have gone through at the airport? Is there anyone who can take action against those abusers’ power to terrorize travelers like myself? I don’t know their names but I will never forget their faces in my life.\\nNo matter how educated, modern and open-minded you are, if you are a girl, our society will always make you uncomfortably aware that you live in a man’s world.\\n\\xa0PS: There was no such problem at other airports (e.g. Turkey/Denmark) and immigration desks there.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPresident Xi JInping warned against meddling in China’s dealings with Taiwan during a phone call with his U.S. counterpart, Joe Biden, that gave no indication of progress on trade, technology or other irritants, including Beijing’s opposition to a top American lawmaker’s possible visit to the island democracy, which the mainland claims as its own territory.\\nXi also warned against splitting the world’s two biggest economies, according to a Chinese government summary of Thursday’s unusually lengthy, three-hour call. Businesspeople and economists warn such a change, brought on by Chinese industrial policy and U.S. curbs on technology exports, might hurt the global economy by slowing innovation and increasing costs.\\nMeanwhile, Xi and Biden are looking at the possibility of meeting in person, according to a U.S. official who declined to be identified further.

But Xi rejected “interference by external forces” that might encourage Taiwan to try to make its decades-old de facto independence permanent.\\r\\n“Resolutely safeguarding China’s national sovereignty and territorial integrity is the firm will of the more than 1.4 billion Chinese people,” said the statement. “Those who play with fire will perish by it.”\\nThe tough language from Xi, who usually tries to appear to be above political disputes and makes blandly positive public comments, suggested Chinese leaders might believe Washington didn’t understand the seriousness of previous warnings about Taiwan.\\nTaiwan and China split in 1949 following a civil war that ended with a Communist victory on the mainland. They have no official relations but are linked by billions of dollars of trade and investment. Both sides say they are one country but disagree over which government is entitled to national leadership.\\nA Ministry of Defense spokesman said ahead of Thursday’s call that Washington “must not arrange for Pelosi to visit Taiwan.” He said the ruling party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, would take “strong measures to thwart any external interference.”\\nXi called on the United States to “honor the one-China principle,” the statement said, referring to Beijing’s position that the mainland and Taiwan are one country.

The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.\\nThe conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.\\nXi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.\\nThe United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.\\nXi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.\\nHe also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.\\nBusinesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.\\n“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”\\n',\n",

The ruling party poured hundreds of billions of dollars into developing fighter jets and other high-tech weapons including “carrier killer” missiles that are thought to be intended to block the U.S. Navy from helping to defend the island.\\nThe conflict over a possible Pelosi visit is more sensitive to Beijing in a year when Xi, who took power in 2012, is expected to try to break with tradition and award himself a third five-year term as party leader.\\nXi, who wants to be seen as restoring China’s rightful historic role as a global leader, has promoted a more assertive policy abroad. The PLA has sent growing numbers of fighter planes and bombers to fly near Taiwan in an attempt to intimidate its democratically elected government.\\nThe United States has no official relations with Taiwan but has extensive commercial ties and informal political connections. Washington is obliged by federal law to see that Taiwan has the means to defend itself.\\nXi called for cooperation on reducing the risk of economic recession, coordinating macroeconomic policies, fighting COVID-19 and “de-escalation of regional hot spots,” according to the government statement.\\nHe also warned against decoupling, or separating, the U.S. and Chinese economies for strategic reasons.\\nBusinesspeople and industry analysts have warned global industries might be split into separate markets with incompatible products due to China’s pressure on its own companies to develop their own technology standards and U.S. restrictions on Chinese access to technology that Washington see as a security risk. That might slow innovation and increase costs.\\n“Attempts at decoupling or severing supply chains in defiance of underlying laws would not help boost the U.S. economy,” the statement said. “They would only make the world economy more vulnerable.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAfter a decade in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s shadow, Li Keqiang is taking his final bow as the country’s premier, marking a shift away from the skilled technocrats who have helped steer the world’s second-biggest economy in favor of officials known mainly for their unquestioned loyalty to China’s most powerful leader in recent history.\\nAfter exiting the ruling Communist Party’s all-powerful Politburo Standing Committee in October — despite being below retirement age — Li’s last major task was delivering the state of the nation address to the rubber-stamp parliament on Monday. The report sought to reassure citizens of the resiliency of the Chinese economy, but contained little that was new.\\nOnce seen as a potential top leader, Li was increasingly sidelined as Xi accumulated ever-greater powers and elevated the military and security services in aid of the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” Li’s lack of visibility sometimes made it difficult to remember he was technically ranked No. 2 in party.\\nLi “was a premier largely kept out of the limelight by order of the boss,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at the London University School of Oriental and African Studies and a longtime observer of Chinese politics.\\nIn an era where personal loyalty trumps all, the fact that Li wasn’t seen purely as a Xi loyalist may end up being “the main reason why he will be remembered fondly,” Tsang said.\\nFor most of his career, Li was known as a cautious, capable, and highly intelligent bureaucrat who rose through, and was bound by, a consensus-oriented Communist Party that reflexively stifles dissent.\\nAs governor and then party secretary of the densely populated agricultural province of Henan in the 1990s, Li squelched reporting on an AIDS outbreak tied to illegal blood-buying rings that pooled plasma and reinjected it into donors after removing the blood products, allegedly with the collusion of local officials.\\nWhile Li was not in office when the scandal broke, his administration worked to quiet it up, prevented victims from seeking redress and harassed private citizens working on behalf of orphans and others affected.\\nBut Li also cut a modestly different profile, an English speaker from a generation of politicians schooled during a time of greater openness to liberal Western ideas. Introduced to politics during the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, he made it into prestigious Peking University, where he studied law and economics, on his own merits rather than through political connections.\\nAfter graduation, Li went to work at the Communist Youth League, an organization that grooms university students for party roles, then headed by future president and party leader Hu Jintao. Higher office soon followed.\\nAmong the largely faceless ranks of Chinese bureaucrats, Li managed to show an unusually candid streak. In a U.S. State Department cable released by WikiLeaks, Li is quoted telling diplomats that Chinese economic growth statistics were “man-made,” and saying he looked instead to electricity demand, rail cargo traffic, and lending as more accurate indicators.\\nThough no populist, in his speeches and public appearances, Li was practically typhonic compared to the typically languorous Xi.\\nYet, he largely failed to make effective use of the platforms he was given, unlike his immediate predecessors. At his sole annual news conference on the closing day of each congressional annual session, Li used up most of his time repeating talks points and reciting statistics. Throughout the upheavals of China’s three-year battle against COVID-19, Li was practically invisible.\\nLi, who hailed from humble backgrounds, had been seen as Hu’s preferred successor as president. But the need to balance party factions prompted the leadership to choose Xi, the son of a former vice premier and party elder, as the consensus candidate.\\nThe two never formed anything like the partnership that characterized Hu’s relationship with his premier, Wen Jiabao — or Mao Zedong’s with the redoubtable Zhou Enlai — although Li and Xi never openly disagreed over fundamentals.\\n“Xi is not the first among equals, but rather is way above equal,” said Cheng Li, an expert on the Chinese leadership at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C. Ultimately, Li was a “team player” who put party unity foremost, he said.\\nMeanwhile, Li’s authority was being gradually shrunk, beginning with a reorganization of offices in 2018. While some may have wished Li had been more “influential or decisive,” the ground was crumbling under his feet as Xi shifted more of the powers of the State Council, China’s Cabinet, to party institutions, Cheng Li said. That shift to expanded party control is expected to continue at the current congress meeting on an even greater scale.\\nAt the same time, Xi appeared to favor trusted long-time brothers-in-arms such as economic adviser Liu He and head of the legislature Li Zhanshu, over Li, leaving him with little visibility or influence\\nHis departure leaves major questions about the future of the private sector that Xi has been reining in, along with wider economic reforms championed by Li and his cohort. His expected replacement, Li Qiang, is a crony of Xi’s from his days in provincial government, best known for his ruthless implementation of last spring’s monthslong COVID-19 lockdown in Shanghai.\\n“Li Keqiang has been associated with a more economics-focused take on governance, which contrasts strongly with the ideological tone that Xi has brought to politics,” said Rana Mitter of Oxford University.\\n“Li may be the last premier of his type, at least for a while,” Mitter said.\\nLi may be remembered less for what he achieved than for the fact that he was the last of the technocrats to serve at the top of the Chinese Communist Party, said Carl Minzner, an expert on Chinese law and governance at New York’s Fordham University and the Council on Foreign Relations.\\nPolitically, Xi’s authoritarian tendencies risk a return to Mao-era practices where elite politics become “yet more byzantine, vicious, and unstable,” Minzner said.\\nLi’s departure “marks the end of an era in which expertise and performance, rather than political loyalty to Xi himself, was the primary career criterion for ambitious officials seeking to rise up to higher office,” he said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFor the first time, United Nations members have agreed on a unified treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas — nearly half the planet’s surface — concluding two weeks of talks in New York.\\nThe U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea came into force in 1994, before marine biodiversity was a well-established concept.\\nAn updated framework to protect marine life in the regions outside national boundary waters, known as the high seas, had been in discussions for more than 20 years, but previous efforts to reach an agreement had repeatedly stalled. The unified agreement treaty was reached late Saturday.\\n“We only really have two major global commons — the atmosphere and the oceans,” said Georgetown marine biologist Rebecca Helm. While the oceans may draw less attention, “protecting this half of earth’s surface is absolutely critical to the health of our planet.”\\nNow that long-awaited treaty text has been finalized, Nichola Clark, an oceans expert at the Pew Charitable Trusts who observed the talks in New York, said, “This is a once in a generation opportunity to protect the oceans — a major win for biodiversity.”\\nThe treaty will create a new body to manage conservation of ocean life and establish marine protected areas in the high seas. And Clark said that’s critical to achieve the U.N. Biodiversity Conference’s recent pledge to protect 30% of the planet’s waters, as well as its land, for conservation.\\nThe treaty also establishes ground rules for conducting environmental impact assessments for commercial activities in the oceans.\\n“It means all activities planned for the high seas need to be looked at, though not all will go through a full assessment,” said Jessica Battle, an oceans governance expert at the Worldwide Fund for Nature.\\nMany marine species — including dolphins, whales, sea turtles and many fish — make long annual migrations, crossing national borders and the high seas. Efforts to protect them — and human communities that rely on fishing or tourism related to marine life — have previously been hampered by a confusing patchwork of laws.\\n“This treaty will help to knit together the different regional treaties to be able to address threats and concerns across species’ ranges,” said Battle.\\nThat protection also helps coastal biodiversity and economies, said Gladys Martínez de Lemos, executive director of the nonprofit Interamerican Association for Environmental Defense focusing on environmental issues across Latin America.\\n“Governments have taken an important step that strengthens the legal protection of two-thirds of the ocean and with it marine biodiversity and the livelihoods of coastal communities,” she said.\\nThe question now is how well the ambitious treaty will be implemented.\\nThe high seas have long suffered exploitation due to commercial fishing and mining, as well as pollution from chemicals and plastics. The new agreement is about “acknowledging that the ocean is not a limitless resource, and it requires global cooperation to use the ocean sustainably,” said Malin Pinsky, a biologist at Rutgers University.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nMore than 35 years after the world’s worst nuclear accident, the dogs of Chernobyl roam among decaying, abandoned buildings in and around the closed plant – somehow still able to find food, breed and survive.\\nScientists hope that studying these dogs can teach humans new tricks about how to live in the harshest, most degraded environments, too.\\nThey published the first of what they hope will be many genetics studies on Friday in the journal Science Advances, focusing on 302 free-roaming dogs living in an officially designated “exclusion zone” around the disaster site. They identified populations whose differing levels of radiation exposure may have made them genetically distinct from one another and other dogs worldwide.\\n“We’ve had this golden opportunity” to lay the groundwork for answering a crucial question: “How do you survive in a hostile environment like this for 15 generations?” said geneticist Elaine Ostrander of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of the study’s many authors.\\nFellow author Tim Mousseau, professor of biological sciences at the University of South Carolina, said the dogs “provide an incredible tool to look at the impacts of this kind of a setting” on mammals overall.\\nChernobyl’s environment is singularly brutal. On April 26, 1986, an explosion and fire at the Ukraine power plant caused radioactive fallout to spew into the atmosphere. Thirty workers were killed in the immediate aftermath while the long-term death toll from radiation poisoning is estimated to eventually number in the thousands.\\nResearchers say most of the dogs they are studying appear to be descendants of pets that residents were forced to leave behind when they evacuated the area.\\nMousseau has been working in the Chernobyl region since the late 1990s and began collecting blood from the dogs around 2017. Some of the dogs live in the power plant, a dystopian, industrial setting. Others are about 9 miles (15 kilometers) or 28 miles (45 kilometers) away.\\nAt first, Ostrander said, they thought the dogs might have intermingled so much over time that they’d be much the same. But through DNA, they could readily identify dogs living in areas of high, low and medium levels of radiation exposure.\\n“That was a huge milestone for us,” said Ostrander. “And what’s surprising is we can even identify families” – about 15 different ones.\\nNow researchers can begin to look for alterations in the DNA.\\n“We can compare them and we can say: OK, what’s different, what’s changed, what’s mutated, what’s evolved, what helps you, what hurts you at the DNA level?” Ostrander said. This will involve separating non-consequential DNA changes from purposeful ones.\\nScientists said the research could have wide applications, providing insights about how animals and humans can live now and in the future in regions of the world under “continuous environmental assault” – and in the high-radiation environment of space.\\nDr. Kari Ekenstedt, a veterinarian who teaches at Purdue University and was not involved in the study, said it’s a first step toward answering important questions about how constant exposure to higher levels of radiation affects large mammals. For example, she said, “Is it going to be changing their genomes at a rapid rate?”\\nResearchers have already started on the follow-up research, which will mean more time with the dogs at the site about 60 miles (100 kilometers) from Kyiv. Mousseau said he and his colleagues were there most recently last October and didn’t see any war-related activity. Mousseau said the team has grown close to some dogs, naming one Prancer because she excitedly prances around when she sees people.\\n“Even though they’re wild, they still very much enjoy human interaction,” he said, “Especially when there’s food involved.” ___\\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

       "  '\\nArchaeologists have found the earliest direct evidence for horseback riding – an innovation that would transform history – in 5,000 year old human skeletons in central Europe.\\n“When you get on a horse and ride it fast, it’s a thrill – I’m sure ancient humans felt the same way,” said David Anthony, a co-author of the study and Hartwick College archaeologist. “Horseback riding was the fastest a human could go before the railroads.”\\nResearchers analyzed more than 200 Bronze Age skeletal remains in museum collections in Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Hungary and the Czech Republic to look for signs of what co-author and University of Helsinki anthropologist Martin Trautmann calls “horse rider syndrome” – six tell-tale markers that indicate a person was likely riding an animal, including characteristic wear marks on the hip sockets, thigh bone and pelvis.\\n“You can read bones like biographies,” said Trautmann, who has previously studied similar wear patterns in skeletons from later periods when horseback riding is well-established in the historical record.\\nThe researchers focused on human skeletons — which are more readily preserved than horse bones in burial sites and museums – and identified five likely riders who lived around 4,500 to 5,000 years ago and belonged to a Bronze Age people called the Yamnaya.\\n“There is earlier evidence for harnessing and milking of horses, but this is the earliest direct evidence so far for horseback riding,” said University of Exeter archaeologist Alan Outram, who was not involved in the research, but praised the approach.\\nThe study was published Friday in the journal Science Advances.\\nDomesticating wild horses on the plains of Eurasia was a process, not a single event, the researchers say.\\nArchaeologists have previously found evidence of people consuming horse milk in dental remains and indications of horses controlled by harnesses and bits dating back more than 5,000 years, but that does not necessarily indicate the horses were ridden.\\nThe Yamnaya culture, known for its characteristic burial mounds, originated in what’s now part of Ukraine and western Russia, an area called the Pontic Caspian steppe. The horses they kept were distinct from modern horses – likely more easily startled and less tolerant of humans – although they may have been the immediate genetic ancestors of modern horses, which emerged a few centuries later, the researchers say.\\nThe Yamnaya are most significant because of their dramatic expansion across Eurasia in only a few generations — moving westward to Hungary and eastward to Mongolia, said University of Helsinki archaeologist and co-author Volker Heyd.\\n“The spread of Indo European languages is linked to their movement, and they reshaped the genetic make-up of Europe,” he said.\\nTheir relationship with horses may have partly enabled this stunning movement, the researchers suggest. “Horses expand the concept of distance – you begin to think about places previously out of reach as being reachable,” said co-author Anthony, the Hartwick College archaeologist.\\nThat does not mean the Yamnaya people were warriors on horseback, as the horses they rode were likely too skittish for stressful battlefield situations, he said. But horses may have allowed the Yamnaya to more effectively send communications, build alliances and manage the herds of cattle that were central to their economy.\\nBecause only a small percentage of the skeletons studied clearly showed all six markers of riding horseback, “it seems that a minority of the people at that time were riders – that does not suggest that a whole society was built on horseback riding,” said molecular archaeologist Ludovic Orlando, who is based at the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse in France and was not involved in the research.\\nStill, he praised the work for helping to better pinpoint the potential genesis of horseback riding.\\n“This is about the origins of something that impacted human history like only a few other things have,” said Orlando.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0Communities around the world emitted more carbon dioxide in 2022 than in any other year on records dating to 1900, a result of air travel rebounding from the pandemic and more cities turning to coal as a low-cost source of power.\\nEmissions of the climate-warming gas that were caused by energy production grew 0.9% to reach 36.8 gigatons in 2022, the International Energy Agency reported Thursday. (The mass of one gigaton is equivalent to about 10,000 fully loaded aircraft carriers, according to NASA.)\\nCarbon dioxide is released when fossil fuels such as oil, coal or natural gas are burned to powers cars, planes, homes and factories. When the gas enters the atmosphere, it traps heat and contributes to the warming of the the climate.\\nExtreme weather events intensified last year’s carbon dioxide emissions: Droughts reduced the amount of water available for hydropower, which increased the need to burn fossil fuels. And heat waves drove up demand for electricity.\\nThursday’s report was described as disconcerting by climate scientists, who warn that energy users around the world must cut emissions dramatically to slow the dire consequences of global warming.\\n“Any emissions growth — even 1% — is a failure,” said Rob Jackson, a professor of earth system science at Stanford University and chairman of the Global Carbon Project, an international group. “We can’t afford growth. We can’t afford stasis. It’s cuts or chaos for the planet. Any year with higher coal emissions is a bad year for our health and for the Earth.”\\nCarbon dioxide emissions from coal grew 1.6% last year. Many communities, primarily in Asia, switched from natural gas to coal to avoid high natural gas prices that were worsened by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the IEA said.\\nAnd as global airline traffic increased, carbon dioxide emissions from burning oil grew 2.5%, with about half the surge resulting from the aviation sector.\\nGlobal emissions have grown in most years since 1900 and have accelerated over time, according to data from IEA. One exception was the pandemic year of 2020, when travel all but came to a standstill.\\nLast year’s level of emissions, though a record high, was nevertheless lower than experts had expected. Increased deployment of renewable energy, electric vehicles and heat pumps together helped prevent an additional 550 megatons of carbon dioxide emissions, the IEA said.\\nStrict pandemic measures and weak economic growth in China also curtailed production, helping to limit overall global emissions. And in Europe, the IEA said, electricity generation from wind and solar power exceeded that of gas or nuclear for the first time.\\n“Without clean energy, the growth in CO2 emissions would have been nearly three times as high,” Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, said in a statement.\\n“However, we still see emissions growing from fossil fuels, hindering efforts to meet the world’s climate targets. International and national fossil fuel companies are making record revenues and need to take their share of responsibility, in line with their public pledges to meet climate goals.”\\nThough emissions continue to grow at worrisome levels, a reversal that would help achieve the climate goals that nations have committed to remains possible, said John Sterman, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan Sustainability Initiative.\\nNations must subsidize renewables, improve energy efficiency, electrify industry and transportation, set a high price for carbon emissions, reduce deforestation, plant trees and rid the system of coal, Sterman argued.\\n“This is a massive, massive undertaking to do all these things, but that’s what’s needed,” he said.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nA meeting of top diplomats of the Group of 20 industrialized and developing nations ended Thursday in New Delhi without a consensus on the Ukraine war, India’s foreign minister said, as members grappled with deepening rifts in their ranks and held contentious talks dominated by Russia’s war and China’s moves to boost its global influence.\\nSubrahmanyam Jaishankar said there were “divergences” on the issue of war in Ukraine “which we could not reconcile as various parties held differing views.”\\n“If we had a perfect meeting of minds on all issues, it would have been a collective statement,” Jaishankar said. He added that members agreed on most issues involving the concerns of less-developed nations, “like strengthening multilateralism, promoting food and energy security, climate change, gender issues and counter-terrorism.”\\nHost India had appealed for all members of the fractured Group of 20 to reach consensus on issues of deep concern to poorer countries even if the broader East-West split over Ukraine could not be resolved. And while others, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, chose to highlight their positive roles in addressing world crises, the divide was palpable.\\nLast week, India was forced to issue a compromised chair’s summary at the conclusion of the G-20 finance ministers meeting after Russia and China objected to a joint communique that retained language on the war in Ukraine drawn directly from last year’s G-20 leaders summit declaration in Indonesia.\\nIn a video address to the assembled foreign ministers in New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged the members not to allow current tensions to destroy agreements that might be reached on food and energy security, climate change and debt.\\n“We are meeting at a time of deep global divisions,” Modi told the group, which included Blinken, Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and their Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, whose discussions would naturally be “affected by the geopolitical tensions of the day.”\\n“We all have our positions and our perspectives on how these tensions should be resolved,” he said, adding that: “We should not allow issues that we cannot resolve together to come in the way of those we can.”\\nIn a nod to fears that the increasingly bitter rift between the United States and its allies on one side and Russia and China on the other appears likely to widen further, Modi said that “multilateralism is in crisis today.”\\nHe lamented that the two main goals of the post-World War II international order — preventing conflict and fostering cooperation — were elusive. “The experience of the last two years, financial crisis, pandemic, terrorism and wars clearly shows that global governance has failed in both its mandates,” he said.\\nIndian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar then addressed the group in person, telling them that they “must find common ground and provide direction.”\\nBlinken, according to remarks released by the State Department, spent much of his time describing U.S. efforts to bolster energy and food security. But he also told the ministers pointedly that Russia’s war with Ukraine could not go unchallenged.\\n“Unfortunately, this meeting has again been marred by Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine, deliberate campaign of destruction against civilian targets, and its attack on the core principles of the UN Charter,” he said.\\n“We must continue to call on Russia to end its war of aggression and withdraw from Ukraine for the sake of international peace and economic stability,” Blinken said. He noted that 141 countries had voted to condemn Russia at the United Nations on the one-year anniversary of the invasion.\\nHowever, several members of the G-20, including India, China and South Africa, chose to abstain in that vote.\\nBlinken and Lavrov met briefly Thursday in the first high-level meeting in months between the two countries. U.S. officials said Blinken and Lavrov chatted for roughly 10 minutes on the sidelines of the G-20 conference.\\nIn addition to attending the G-20 and seeing Modi and Jaishankar individually on Thursday, Blinken met separately with the foreign ministers of Brazil, Indonesia, Nigeria and South Africa, and was also scheduled to hold talks with the foreign ministers of the Netherlands and Mexico.\\nAs at most international events since last year, the split over the war in Ukraine and its impact on global energy and food security overshadowed the proceedings. But as the conflict has dragged on over the past 12 months, the divide has grown and now threatens to become a principal irritant in U.S.-China ties that were already on the rocks for other reasons.\\nA Chinese peace proposal for Ukraine that has drawn praise from Russia but dismissals from the West has done nothing to improve matters as U.S. officials have repeatedly accused China in recent days of considering the provision of weapons to Russia for use in the war.\\nBlinken said Wednesday that the Chinese plan rang hollow given its focus on “sovereignty” compared to its own recent actions.\\n“China can’t have it both ways,” Blinken told reporters in Tashkent, Uzbekistan before traveling to New Delhi. “It can’t be putting itself out as a force for peace in public, while in one way or another, it continues to fuel the flames of this fire that Vladimir Putin started.”\\nHe also said there is “zero evidence” that Putin is genuinely prepared for diplomacy to end the war. “To the contrary, the evidence is all in the other direction,” he said.\\nChina on Thursday hit back at those comments, accusing the U.S. of promoting war by supplying Ukraine with weapons and violating Chinese sovereignty with support for Taiwan.\\n“The U.S. says it wants peace, but it is waging wars around the world and inciting confrontation,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning told reporters in Beijing.\\n“While emphasizing the need to respect and maintain the international order, the U.S. has vigorously pursued illegal unilateral sanctions, putting domestic law above international law,” she said. “What the U.S. should do is to reflect on itself, stop confusing the public and making irresponsible remarks, earnestly shoulder its responsibilities, and do something to promote the de-escalation of the situation and peace talks.”\\nIn the meantime, Moscow has been unrelenting in pushing its view that the West, led by the U.S., is trying to destroy Russia.\\nAhead of the meeting, the Russian Foreign Ministry slammed U.S. policies, saying that Lavrov and his delegation would use the G-20 to “focus on the attempts by the West to take revenge for the inevitable disappearance of the levers of dominance from its hands.”\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

It suggests that those who lived in what is now Italy when the ice expanded southward some 25,000 years ago appeared to have found themselves in a dead end compared to their cousins who lived in region that now covers parts of southern France, Spain and Portugal.\\nThose who went west survived the worst of the Ice Age, known to scientists as the last glacial maximum, said Cosimo Posth, a researcher at the University of Tuebingen who led the study.\\n“To our big surprise, in Italy the population that was present before the last glacial maximum completely disappears,” said Posth. “They didn’t make it.”\\nGenetic analysis of individuals from Italy after the last Ice Age shows the dark-skinned, dark-eyed Gravettian population was replaced by newcomers from the Balkans, who brought blue eyes and a touch of Near Eastern ancestry with them.\\nThe researchers analyzed 116 new genetic samples they added to 240 ancient specimens already known, covering a span from about 45,000 to 5,000 years ago.\\nThe Gravettians who survived the Ice Age in Spain, meanwhile, mixed with migrants from the east as Europe warmed again almost 15,000 years ago and then swiftly repopulated the continent from Iberia to Poland and the British Isles, dominating it for thousands of years.\\nThe genetic footprint of the Gravettians can be found in the last Spanish hunter-gatherer populations until the arrival of the first farmers, who migrated to Europe from Anatolia some 8,000 years ago, said Posth.\\nIn an accompanying commentary published by Nature, Ludovic Orlando of the Center for Anthropobiology and Genomics in Toulouse, France, said the study showed how climate change affected populations in Europe and that ancient human cultures weren’t always ethnically homogenous.\\nOrlando, who was not involved in the study, said the findings also demonstrate how fluid Europe’s genetic history was. “No modern population can claim a single origin from the human groups that first became established on the continent,” he said.\\nPosth hopes to delve deeper into the history of ancient migration in Europe, particularly the mysterious people who arrived from the Balkans around the time of the last glacial maximum.\\n',\n",

Authorities closed the airspace over St. Petersburg in response to what some reports said was a drone.\\nAlso Tuesday, several Russian television stations aired a missile attack warning that officials blamed on a hacking attack.\\nThe drone attacks targeted regions inside Russia along the border with Ukraine and deeper into the country, according to local Russian authorities.\\nA drone fell near the village of Gubastovo, less than 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow, Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the region surrounding the Russian capital, said in an online statement.\\nThe drone did not cause any damage, Vorobyov said, but it likely targeted “a civilian infrastructure object.”\\nPictures of the drone showed it was a small Ukrainian-made model with a reported range of up to 800 kilometers (nearly 500 miles) but no capacity to carry a large load of explosives.\\nRussian forces early Tuesday shot down another Ukrainian drone over the Bryansk region, local Gov. Aleksandr Bogomaz said in a Telegram post.\\nThree drones also targeted Russia’s Belgorod region on Monday night, with one flying through an apartment window in the capital, local authorities reported. Regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov said the drones caused minor damage to buildings and cars.\\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said Ukraine used drones to attack facilities in the Krasnodar region and neighboring Adygea. It said the drones were brought down by electronic warfare assets, adding that one of them crashed into a field and another diverted from its flight path and missed a facility it was supposed to attack.\\nRussia’s state RIA Novosti news agency reported a fire at the oil facility, and some other Russian reports said that two drones exploded nearby.\\nWhile Ukrainian drone strikes on the Russian border regions of Bryansk and Belgorod have become a regular occurrence, other strikes reflected a more ambitious effort.\\nSome Russian commentators described the drone attacks as an attempt by Ukraine to showcase its capability to strike deep behind the lines, foment tensions in Russia and rally the Ukrainian public. Some Russian war bloggers described the raids as a possible rehearsal for a bigger, more ambitious attack.\\nAndrei Medvedev, a commentator with Russian state television who serves as a deputy speaker of Moscow’s city legislature and runs a popular blog about the war, warned that the drone strikes could be a precursor to wider attacks within Russia that could accompany Ukraine’s attempt to launch a counteroffensive.\\n“The strikes of exploding drones on targets behind our lines will be part of that offensive,” Medvedev said, adding that Ukraine could try to extend the range of its drones.\\nRussia hawks urged strong retaliation. Igor Korotchenko, a retired Russian army colonel turned military commentator, called for a punishing strike on the Ukrainian presidential office in Kyiv.\\nAnother retired military officer, Viktor Alksnis, noted that the drone attacks marked the expansion of the conflict and criticized Putin for failing to deliver a strong response.\\nAlso on Tuesday, authorities reported that airspace around St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, was temporarily closed, halting all departures and arrivals at the main airport, Pulkovo. Officials did not give a reason for the move, but some Russian reports claimed that it was triggered by an unidentified drone.\\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was conducting air defense drills in western Russia.\\nLast year, Russian authorities repeatedly reported shooting down Ukrainian drones over annexed Crimea. In December, the Russian military said Ukraine used drones to hit two bases for long-range bombers deep inside Russian territory.\\nSpeaking at Russia’s main security agency, the FSB, Putin urged the service to tighten security on the Ukraine border.\\nIn another development that fueled tensions across Russia on Tuesday, an air raid alarm interrupted the programming of several TV channels and radio stations in several regions. Russia’s Emergency Ministry said in an online statement that the announcement was a hoax “resulting from a hacking of the servers of radio stations and TV channels in some regions of the country.”\\nMeanwhile, satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press appeared to show a Russian warplane in Belarus that Belarusian guerrillas claimed to have targeted as largely intact.\\nTuesday’s high-resolution images from Planet Labs PBC and Maxar Technologies showed the Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft after what Belarusian opposition activists described as an attack on the Machulishchy air base Sunday outside the Belarusian capital of Minsk.\\nHowever, a discoloration could be seen on the aircraft’s distinctive, circular rotodome above its fuselage that could be damage. That discoloration wasn’t seen in earlier images of the aircraft at the air base. The Maxar image also showed what appeared to be vehicles near the airplane as well.\\nBelarusian activists supporting Ukraine alleged that the aircraft was seriously damaged. Russian and Belarusian officials did not comment on the claims.\\nIn Ukraine, four people were killed and five others wounded Tuesday by renewed Russian shelling of the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said in a Telegram.\\nA 68-year-old man was also killed as Russian forces shelled Kupiansk, a town in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region, Gov. Oleh Syniehubov said.\\nThe fiercest fighting continued to be in eastern areas of Ukraine, where Russia wants control over all four of the provinces it illegally annexed in September.\\nUkrainian officials said Russian forces have deployed additional troops and equipment, including the latest T-90 battle tanks, in those areas.\\nIn a video address, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked U.S. industrialists for supporting Ukraine and voiced hope for their support in rebuilding the country after the war. Zelenskyy noted that the country faces a “colossal task” to restore hundreds of thousands of damaged sites, including “whole cities, industries, productions.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nA passenger train carrying hundreds of people collided at high speed with an oncoming freight train in a fiery wreck in northern Greece, killing 32 and injuring at least 85, officials said Wednesday.\\nMultiple cars derailed and at least three burst into flames after the collision near the town of Tempe on Tuesday just before midnight. Rescue crews illuminated the scene with floodlights before dawn on Wednesday as they searched frantically through the twisted, smoking wreckage for survivors.\\nSurvivors said several passengers were thrown through the windows of the train cars due to the impact. They said others fought to free themselves after the passenger train buckled, slamming into a field next to the tracks near a gorge about 380 kilometers (235 miles) north of Athens where major highway and rail tunnels are located.\\n“There were many big pieces of steel,” said Vassilis Polyzos, a local resident who was one of the first people on the scene. “The trains were completely destroyed, both passenger and freight trains.”\\nHe said dazed and disoriented people were escaping out of the train’s rear cars as he arrived.\\n“People, naturally, were scared — very scared,” he said. “They were looking around, searching; they didn’t know where they were.”\\nThe trains crashed just before the Vale of Tempe, a gorge that separates the regions of Thessaly and Macedonia. Costas Agorastos, the regional governor of the Thessaly area, told Greece’s Skai television the two trains crashed head on at high speed.\\n“Carriage one and two no longer exist, and the third has derailed,” he said.\\nRescuers wearing head lamps worked in thick smoke, pulling pieces of mangled metal from the cars to search for trapped people. Others scoured the field with flashlights and checked underneath the wreckage. Several of the dead are believed to have been found in the restaurant area near the front of the passenger train.\\nHospital officials in the nearby city of Larissa said at least 25 of those hurt had serious injuries.\\n“The evacuation process is ongoing and is being carried out under very difficult conditions due to the severity of the collision between the two trains,” said Vassilis Varthakoyiannis, a spokesperson for Greece’s firefighting service.\\nThe possible cause of the collision was not immediately clear. Two rail officials were being questioned by police but had not been detained.\\nPassengers who received minor injuries or were unharmed were transported by bus to Thessaloniki, 130 kilometers (80 miles) to the north. Police took their names as they arrived, in an effort to track anyone who may be missing.\\nA teenage survivor who did not give his name told reporters that just before the crash he felt a strong braking and saw sparks and then there was a sudden stop.\\n“Our carriage didn’t derail, but the ones in front did and were smashed,” he said, visibly shaken.\\nHe added that the first car caught fire and that he used a bag to break the window of his car, the fourth, and escape.\\nRail operator Hellenic Train said the northbound passenger train from Athens to Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, had about 350 passengers on board.\\nAgorastos described the collision on state television as “very powerful” and said it was “a terrible night.”\\n“The front section of the train was smashed. ... We’re getting cranes to come in and special lifting equipment clear the debris and lift the rail cars. There’s debris flung all around the crash site.”\\nOfficials said the army had been contacted to assist.\\nHellenic Train, which has added highspeed services in recent years, is operated by Italy’s FS Group, which runs rail services in several European countries.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nA crucial question has eluded governments and health agencies around the world since the COVID-19 pandemic began: Did the virus originate in animals or leak from a Chinese lab?\\nNow, the U.S. Department of Energy has assessed with “low confidence” in that it began with a lab leak, according to a person familiar with the report who wasn’t authorized to discuss it. The report has not been made public.\\nBut others in the U.S. intelligence community disagree.\\n“There is not a consensus right now in the U.S. government about exactly how COVID started,” John Kirby, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said Monday. “There is just not an intelligence community consensus.”\\nThe DOE’s conclusion was first reported over the weekend in the Wall Street Journal, which said the classified report was based on new intelligence and noted in an update to a 2021 document. The DOE oversees a national network of labs.\\nWhite House officials on Monday declined to confirm press reports about the assessment.\\nIn 2021, officials released an intelligence report summary that said four members of the U.S. intelligence community believed with low confidence that the virus was first transmitted from an animal to a human, and a fifth believed with moderate confidence that the first human infection was linked to a lab.\\nWhile some scientists are open to the lab-leak theory, others continue to believe the virus came from animals, mutated, and jumped into people — as has happened in the past with viruses. Experts say the true origin of the pandemic may not be known for many years — if ever.\\nCALLS FOR MORE INVESTIGATION\\nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the report. All 18 offices of the U.S. intelligence community had access to the information the DOE used in reaching its assessment.\\nAlina Chan, a molecular biologist at the Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, said she isn’t sure what new intelligence the agencies had, but “it’s reasonable to infer” it relates to activities at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. She said a 2018 research proposal co-authored by scientists there and their U.S. collaborators “essentially described a blueprint for COVID-like viruses.”\\n“Less than two years later, such a virus was causing an outbreak in the city,” she said.\\nThe Wuhan institute had been studying coronaviruses for years, in part because of widespread concerns — tracing back to SARS — that coronaviruses could be the source of the next pandemic.\\nNo intelligence agency has said they believe the coronavirus that caused COVID-19 was released intentionally. The unclassified 2021 summary was clear on this point, saying: “We judge the virus was not developed as a biological weapon.”\\n“Lab accidents happen at a surprising frequency. A lot of people don’t really hear about lab accidents because they’re not talked about publicly,” said Chan, who co-authored a book about the search for COVID-19 origins. Such accidents “underscore a need to make work with highly dangerous pathogens more transparent and more accountable.”\\nLast year, the World Health Organization recommended a deeper probe into a possible lab accident. Chan said she hopes the latest report sparks more investigation in the United States.\\nChina has called the suggestion that COVID-19 came from a Chinese laboratory “ baseless.”\\nSUPPORT FOR ANIMAL THEORY\\nMany scientists believe the animal-to-human theory of the coronavirus remains much more plausible. They theorize it emerged in the wild and jumped from bats to humans, either directly or through another animal.\\nIn a 2021 research paper in the journal Cell, scientists said the COVID-19 virus is the ninth documented coronavirus to infect humans — and all the previous ones originated in animals.\\nTwo studies, published last year by the journal Science, bolstered the animal origin theory. That research found that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan was likely the early epicenter. Scientists concluded that the virus likely spilled from animals into people two separate times.\\n“The scientific literature contains essentially nothing but original research articles that support a natural origin of this virus pandemic,” said Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona who has extensively studied COVID-19′s origins.\\nHe said the fact that others in the intelligence community looked at the same information as the DOE and “it apparently didn’t move the needle speaks volumes.” He said he takes such intelligence assessments with a grain of salt because he doesn’t think the people making them “have the scientific expertise ... to really understand the most important evidence that they need to understand.”\\nThe U.S. should be more transparent and release the new intelligence that apparently swayed the DOE, Worobey said.\\nREACTION TO THE REPORT\\nThe DOE conclusion comes to light as House Republicans have been using their new majority power to investigate all aspects of the pandemic, including the origin, as well as what they contend were officials’ efforts to conceal the fact that it leaked from a lab in Wuhan. Earlier this month, Republicans sent letters to Dr. Anthony Fauci, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines, Health Secretary Xavier Beccera and others as part of their investigative efforts.\\nThe now retired Fauci, who served as the country’s top infectious disease expert under both Republican and Democratic presidents, has called the GOP criticism nonsense.\\nRep. Mike McCaul, R-Texas, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, has asked the Biden administration to provide Congress with “a full and thorough” briefing on the report and the evidence behind it.\\nKirby, the National Security Council spokesman, emphasized that President Joe Biden believes it’s important to know what happened “so we can better prevent future pandemics” but that such research “must be done in a safe and secure manner and as transparent as possible to the rest of the world.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nInside a shrine overlooking snow-capped mountains, Hindu priests heaped spoonfuls of puffed rice and ghee into a crackling fire. They closed their eyes and chanted in Sanskrit, hoping their prayers would somehow turn back time and save their holy — and sinking — town.\\nFor months, the roughly 20,000 residents in Joshimath, burrowed in the Himalayas and revered by Hindu and Sikh pilgrims, have watched the earth slowly swallow their community. They pleaded for help that never arrived, and in January their desperate plight made it into the international spotlight.\\nBut by then, Joshimath was already a disaster zone. Multistoried hotels slumped to one side; cracked roads gaped open. More than 860 homes were uninhabitable, splayed by deep fissures that snaked through ceilings, floors and walls. And instead of saviors they got bulldozers that razed whole lopsided swaths of the town.\\nThe holy town was built on piles of debris left behind by years of landslides and earthquakes. Scientists have warned for decades, including in a 1976 report, that Joshimath could not withstand the level of heavy construction that has recently been taking place.\\n“Cracks are widening every day and people are in fear. We have been saying for years this is not just a disaster, but a disaster in the making… it’s a time bomb,” said Atul Sati, an activist with the Save Joshimath Committee.\\nJoshimath’s future is at risk, experts and activists say, due in part to a push backed by the prime minister’s political party to grow religious tourism in Uttarakhand, the holy town’s home state. On top of climate change, extensive new construction to accommodate more tourists and accelerate hydropower projects in the region is exacerbating subsidence — the sinking of land.\\nLocated 1,890 meters (6,200 feet) above sea level, Joshimath is said to have special spiritual powers and believed to be where Hindu guru Adi Shankaracharya found enlightenment in the 8th century before going on to establish four monasteries across India, including one in Joshimath.\\nVisitors pass through the town on their way to the famous Sikh shrine, Hemkund Sahib, and the Hindu temple, Badrinath.\\n“It must be protected,” said Brahmachari Mukundanand, a local priest who called Joshimath the “brain of North India” and explained that “Our body can still function if some limbs are cut off. But if anything happens to our brain, we can’t function. … Its survival is extremely important.”\\nThe town’s loose topsoil and soft rocks can only support so much and that limit, according to environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, may have already been breached.\\n“You can’t just construct anything anywhere just because it is allowed,” he said. “In the short term, you might think it’s development. But in the long term, it is actually devastation.”\\nAt least 240 families have been forced to relocate without knowing if they would be able to return.\\nPrabha Sati, who fled Joshimath in a panic last month when her home began to crack and tilt, came back to grab the television, idols of Hindu gods and some shoes before state officials demolished her home.\\n“We built this house with so much difficulty. Now I will have to leave everything behind. Every small piece of it will be destroyed,” she said, blinking back tears.\\nAuthorities, ignoring expert warnings, have continued to move forward with costly projects in the region, including a slew of hydropower stations and a lengthy highway. The latter is aimed at further boosting religious tourism, a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party.\\nIn 2021, Modi promised a prosperous decade ahead for Uttarakhand. It is dotted with several holy shrines and improving the state’s infrastructure has already led to a steady rise in pilgrims over the decades. Nearly 500,000 passed through Joshimath in 2019, state data shows.\\n“In the next 10 years, the state will receive more tourists than it did in the last 100 years,” Modi said.\\nA big Uttarakhand tourism draw is the Char Dham pilgrimage, one of the toughest in India.\\nThe route takes people to four, high-altitude Hindu temples. Pilgrims traverse challenging terrain, dropping oxygen levels and harsh weather between Badrinath, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Yamunotri temples. In 2022, over 200 out of the 250,000 pilgrims died while making the journey. Authorities said the rise in visitors was straining existing infrastructure.\\nAlready underway, the Char Dham infrastructure project, aims to make the journey more accessible via a 10-meter (32-foot) wide and 889-kilometer (552 miles) long all-weather highway as well as a 327-kilometer (203-mile) railway line that would crisscross through the mountains.\\nIt is a controversial project with some experts saying it will exacerbate the fragile situation in the upper Himalayas where several towns are built atop landslide debris.\\nVeteran environmentalist Ravi Chopra called the project a desecration when he resigned from a court-ordered committee studying its impact. To create such wide roads, engineers would need to smash boulders, cut trees and strip shrubbery, which he said will weaken slopes and make them “more susceptible to natural disasters.”\\nUrban planning expert Kiran Shinde suggested a pedestrian corridor instead, noting these places were never meant for cars nor crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands.\\n“The highway is the most disastrous thing to happen to the Char Dham,” said Shinde, a professor at Australia’s La Trobe University who has written on religious tourism. “Let people walk.”\\nCracks continue to form. Located near a rail line construction site, Sangeeta Krishali’s home in Lachmoli, about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Joshimath, has them. She fears for her safety: “It happened there, it can happen here, too.”\\nIn Joshimath’s foothills, construction was paused on a road for the Char Dham project that would ferry tourists faster to the Badrinath temple after cracks emerged in people’s homes.\\nLocals feared it was too late. A long, jagged crack running across one of the front walls in the famed Adi Shankaracharya monastery had deepened worryingly in recent weeks, said Vishnu Priyanand, one of the priests.\\n“Let places of worship remain as places of worship. Don’t make them tourist spots,” he pleaded.\\nIt’s not just the highways. For the past 17 years, Atul Sati, the Save Joshimath Committee member, has been convinced that a hydropower station located near his town could one day ruin it. He isn’t alone. In late January, hundreds of residents protested against the National Thermal Power Corporation’s Tapovan project. Posters reading ‘Go back NTPC’ are plastered across the town’s main market.\\n“Our town is on the verge of destruction because of this project,” Sati said.\\nLocals say construction blasts for a 12-kilometer (7-mile) tunnel for the station are causing their homes to crumble. Work has been suspended but NTPC officials deny any link to Joshimath’s subsidence. An expert committee is still investigating the cause, but state officials earlier blamed faulty drainage systems.\\nThe state government announced interim relief packages, including compensation worth 150,000 rupees ($1,813) to each affected family, said Himanshu Khurana, the officer in charge of Chamoli district where Joshimath is located. Various government agencies were conducting surveys to determine what caused the damage, he added.\\nThe crisis in Joshimath has reignited questions over whether India’s quest for more hydropower in the mountains to cut its reliance on coal can be achieved sustainably. Uttarakhand, home to more than 30 rivers and surrounded by melting glaciers, has around 100 hydropower projects in varying stages.\\nIn 2021, 200 people died after the Tapovan plant near Joshimath was submerged by severe floods caused in part by fast shrinking glaciers, and over 6,000 were killed in the state after a devastating cloudburst in 2013.\\nThe heavy construction required for hydropower, like blasting boulders, diverting river flows and cutting through forests, in a region already vulnerable to climate change, could do irreparable damage, experts warn.\\nIt could also displace entire villages, as residents of a hamlet near Joshimath found out.\\nHaat, a village along the Alaknanda River, was once a sacred hamlet that traced its origins to the guru Adi Shankaracharya, who is said to have established another temple here in the 8th Century.\\nToday, it is a dumping site for waste and a storage pit for construction materials after the village was acquired in 2009 by an energy enterprise to build a hydropower project.\\nThe Laxmi Narayan temple, encircled by grey stacks of cement, is the only part of the village still standing. All of its residents left over the years as authorities began razing down their homes, said Rajendra Hatwal, once the village chief who now lives in another town nearby.\\nThe project, he fumed, had killed Haat.\\n“What sort of development requires destroying these priceless places? We don’t want any part of it.”\\nA court last year directed authorities to stop dumping waste near the historic temple, which was once the last rest stop for devotees on their pilgrimage to Badrinath.\\nHatwal and a few others still check in on the temple often. A caretaker, who refused to leave, lives in a makeshift room next to it. He sweeps the grounds, cleans the idols and prepares tea for the odd guest who comes through.\\nThey feared its days, like their homes, were also numbered.\\n“We are fighting to protect the temple. We want to preserve our ancient culture to pass on to a new generation,” said Hatwal. “They have not only destroyed a village - they have finished a 1,200 year old culture.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nU.S. intelligence shows that China’s President Xi Jinping has instructed his country’s military to “be ready by 2027” to invade Taiwan though he may be currently harboring doubts about his ability to do so given Russia’s experience in its war with Ukraine, CIA Director William Burns said.\\nBurns, in a television interview that aired Sunday, stressed that the United States must take “very seriously” Xi’s desire to ultimately control Taiwan even if military conflict is not inevitable.\\n“We do know, as has been made public, that President Xi has instructed the PLA, the Chinese military leadership, to be ready by 2027 to invade Taiwan, but that doesn’t mean that he’s decided to invade in 2027 or any other year as well,” Burns told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\\n“I think our judgment at least is that President Xi and his military leadership have doubts today about whether they could accomplish that invasion,” he said.\\nTaiwan and China split in 1949 after a civil war that ended with the Communist Party in control of the mainland. The self-governing island acts like a sovereign nation yet is not recognized by the United Nations or any major country. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter formally recognized the government in Beijing and cut nation-to-nation ties with Taiwan. In response, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, creating a benchmark for a continuing relationship.\\nTaiwan has received numerous displays of official American support for the island democracy in the face of growing shows of force by Beijing, which claims Taiwan as part of its territory. President Joe Biden has said that American forces would defend Taiwan if China tries to invade. The White House says U.S. policy has not changed in making clear that Washington wants to see Taiwan’s status resolved peacefully. It is silent as to whether U.S. forces might be sent in response to a Chinese attack.\\nIn Sunday’s interview, Burns said the support from the U.S. and European allies for Ukraine following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of that country may be acting as a potential deterrent to Chinese officials for now but said the risks of a possible attack on Taiwan will only grow stronger.\\n“I think, as they’ve looked at Putin’s experience in Ukraine, that’s probably reinforced some of those doubts,” Burns said. “So, all I would say is that I think the risks of, you know, a potential use of force probably grow the further into this decade you get and beyond it, into the following decade as well.\\n“So that’s something obviously, that we watch very, very carefully,” he said.\\n',\n",

Survivors indicated that dozens more could be missing from the boat that had set out from Turkey.\\nThe Italian Coast Guard said at least 80 people were found alive, “some of whom succeeded in reaching the shore after the shipwreck.”\\nThe precise numbers were hard to establish. A reporter for Italian RAI state TV, standing next to the wreckage on the beach, quoted local authorities as saying 60 bodies had been recovered. With his foot, he indicated a life preserver bearing the word “Smyrna,” a Turkish port also known as Izmir.\\nAuthorities said the cloth-covered bodies were brought to the sports stadium in the nearest city, Crotone.\\nMore than 170 migrants were estimated to have been aboard the ship, two U.N. agencies, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organization for Migration, said in a joint statement that cited survivor accounts.\\nAmong those aboard, there were “children and entire families,″ the U.N. statement, with most of the passengers coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Somalia.\\nThe boat collided with the reefs in violently rough seas, whipped up by powerful winds. Some of the wreckage ended up on a stretch of beach along Calabria’s Ionian Sea coast, where splintered pieces of bright blue wood littered the sand like matchsticks.\\n“All of the survivors are adults,″ said Red Cross volunteer Ignazio Mangione. ”Unfortunately, all the children are among the missing or were found dead on the beach.” A months-old baby and a boy of 8 were reported among the dead.\\nReporting from the village of Steccato di Cutro, state TV quoted survivors as saying the boat had set out five days earlier from Turkey.\\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni said the migrants had been crowded into a 20-meter (66-foot) -long boat.\\nItalian authorities said a rescue operation involving a helicopter and police aircraft, and vessels from state firefighter squads, the coast guard and border police, was underway Sunday. Local fishermen also joined in the search for survivors.\\nA pair of firefighter water rescuers struggled with wind gusts and waves several meters (yards) high crashing onto the beach as they brought a body ashore.\\nA local priest said he blessed bodies while they were still lying on the beach.\\nOne survivor was taken into custody for questioning after survivors indicated he was a trafficker, Rai state TV said.\\nSome of the survivors tried to keep warm, wrapped in blankets and quilts. They were taken by bus to a temporary shelter. State TV said 22 survivors were taken to the hospital for treatment.\\nPope Francis told the faithful in St. Peter’s Square he was pained by the news. “I pray for each of them, for the missing and the other migrants who survived.” The pontiff added he also was praying for the rescuers “and for those who give welcome” to the migrants.\\n“It’s an enormous tragedy,” Crotone Mayor Vincenzo Voce told RAI state TV. “In solidarity, the city will find places in the cemetery” for the dead, Voce said.\\nIn 2022, some 105,000 migrants arrived on Italian shores, some 38,000 more than in 2021, according to Interior Ministry figures.\\nAccording to U.N. figures, arrivals from the Turkish route accounted for 15% of the total number, with nearly half of those fleeing from Afghanistan.\\nIn a statement released by the premier’s office Sunday, Meloni expressed “her deep sorrow for the many human lives torn away by human traffickers.”\\n“It’s inhumane to exchange the lives of men, women and children for the ‘price’ of a ticket paid by them in the false prospect for a safe voyage,” said Meloni, a far-right-wing leader whose governing allies includes the anti-migrant League party.\\nShe vowed to pursue a crackdown on departures arranged by people smugglers and to press fellow European Union leaders to help Italy in her quest.\\nOpposition parties, however, pointed to Sunday’s tragedy as proof that Italy’s migration policy was badly flawed.\\n“Condemning only the smugglers, as the center-right is doing now, is hypocrisy,″ Laura Ferrara, a European Parliament lawmaker from the populist 5-Star Movement, said.\\n“The truth is that the EU today doesn’t offer effective alternatives for those who are forced abandon their country of origin,″ Ferrara said in a statement.\\nAs well as the route from Turkey, another route employed traffickers crosses the central Mediterranean Sea from Libya’s coast, where migrants often endure brutal detention conditions for months, before they are allowed to board rubber dinghies or aging wooden fishing boats, toward Italian shores.

       "  '\\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz sought assurances Saturday from India that it would support, or at least not block, Western efforts to isolate Russia for waging a devastating war against Ukraine.\\nFollowing his talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Scholz stressed that developing countries were being negatively impacted by energy and food shortages resulting from the war and hopes that India will help secure critical supplies to Asia, Africa and the Americas.\\nModi maintained his cautious approach and said India wanted the conflict to be ended through dialogue and diplomacy. “India is ready to make its contribution to any peace initiative,” he added.\\nHe has refrained from any overt criticism of Russia as Moscow is a major supplier of arms, oil and India’s other economic needs.\\nScholz said that Russia’s war against Ukraine “violated the fundamental principle to what we all agree of not changing borders through the use of violence.”\\nWhile the two leaders took no questions from the media after their meeting, Scholz later told German reporters that he and Modi had discussed the war in Ukraine “very extensively and very intensly,” but declined to elaborate, citing the confidential nature of the talks.\\nScholz, who arrived in the Indian capital on Saturday, also discussed with Modi ways to boost economic cooperation, including through a free trade agreement between the European Union and India. Scholz made clear he favors a free trade deal and said he “personally will make sure that (the talks) do not drag on.”\\nThe trip is Scholz’s first official visit to India, though it is his fourth meeting with Modi since taking office in 2021, underlining Germany’s interest in reaching out to Delhi.\\n“There is huge potential for intensified cooperation in sectors such as renewables, hydrogen, mobility, pharma and digital economy” with India, Scholz said in an interview published by The Times of India newspaper on Saturday.\\nAfter a videoconference with fellow leaders from the Group of Seven industrial powers on Friday, Scholz said before leaving Berlin that “internationally, we are endeavoring to make clear that Russia stands alone in the world with its aggression against Ukraine.”\\nPhilipp Ackermann, the German ambassador to India, said he understands why India is buying large quantities of oil from Russia.\\n“That’s something that the Indian government decides and as you get it at a very, very low price, you know I cannot blame the Indian government for buying it,” New Delhi Television cited Ackermann as saying.\\nGermany has been pushing to diversify its economic relations as it and other European countries try to avoid being dependent on China, a German official said on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to reporters.\\nModi said the business delegation accompanying Scholz was firming up agreements with India in digital technology, the telecommunication sector and diversification of supply chains.\\nScholz reiterated that Germany welcomes skilled workers from India, especially in information technology and software industries.\\n“We want to benefit from the Indian talent employed in Germany in the industrial sector,” he said.\\nSpeaking to reporters later Saturday, Scholz said Germany could help India achieve its ambitious goals when it comes to expanding renewable power generation.\\nIndia is set to receive $10.5 billion in aid by 2030 to boost the use of clean energy under agreements the two sides signed in May last year.\\nScholz’s delegation included several German business leaders, including the head of ThyssenKrupp, which is trying to sell further submarines to India.\\nAsked whether such a deal with India, which has been a major buyer of arms from Russia, could be struck, Scholz said he had “the impression that the quality of German technology enjoys great recognition and appreciate here.”\\nThe two-day visit will also take Scholz to India’s information technology hub Bengaluru on Sunday.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nOne year into Russia’s war against Ukraine, China is offering a 12-point proposal to end the fighting.\\nThe proposal follows China’s recent announcement that it is trying to act as mediator in the war that has re-energized Western alliances viewed by Beijing and Moscow as rivals. China’s top diplomat indicated that the plan was coming at a security conference this week in Munich, Germany.\\nWith its release, President Xi Jinping’s government is reiterating China’s claim to being neutral, despite blocking efforts at the United Nations to condemn the invasion. The document echoes Russian complaints that Western governments are to blame for the Feb. 24, 2022 invasion and criticizes sanctions on Russia.\\nAt the Munich meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed skepticism about Beijing’s position before the plan’s release. He said China has provided non-lethal assistance that supports Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war effort and said the U.S. has intelligence that Beijing is “considering providing lethal support.” China has called the allegation a “smear” and said it lacks evidence.\\nWHAT HAS CHINA PROPOSED?\\nChina’s proposal calls for a ceasefire and peace talks, and an end to Western sanctions against Russia. It says “relevant countries should stop abusing unilateral sanctions” and “do their share in de-escalating the Ukraine crisis.”\\nIt says sovereignty of all countries should be upheld, though it doesn’t specify what that would look like for Ukraine, and the land taken from it since Russia seized Crimea in 2014.\\nThe proposal condemns a “Cold War mentality,” a rebuke of the United States and NATO, the U.S.-European military alliance. “The security of a region should not be achieved by strengthening or expanding military blocs,” the proposal says. Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded a promise that Ukraine will not join the bloc before the invasion.\\nOther points call for a cease-fire, peace talks, protection for prisoners of war and stopping attacks on civilians, keeping nuclear power plants safe and facilitating grain exports.\\nDOES CHINA BACK RUSSIA IN ITS WAR ON UKRAINE?\\nChina has offered contradictory statements regarding its stance. It says Russia was provoked into taking action by NATO’s eastward expansion, but has also claimed neutrality on the war.\\nAhead of Russia’s attack, Xi and Putin attended the opening of last year’s Winter Olympics in Beijing and issued a statement that their governments had a “no limits” friendship. China has since ignored Western criticism and reaffirmed that pledge.\\nPutin has said he expects Xi to visit Russia in the next few months. China has yet to confirm that.\\nChina is “trying to have it both ways,” Blinken said Sunday on NBC.\\n“Publicly, they present themselves as a country striving for peace in Ukraine, but privately, as I said, we’ve seen already over these past months the provision of non-lethal assistance that does go directly to aiding and abetting Russia’s war effort.”\\nHAS CHINA PROVIDED SUPPORT TO RUSSIA?\\nChina’s support for Russia has been largely rhetorical and political. Beijing has helped to prevent efforts to condemn Moscow at the United Nations. There is no public evidence it is currently supplying arms to Russia, but the U.S. has said China is providing non-lethal support already and may do more.\\nBlinken, at the Munich conference, said the United States has long been concerned that China would provide weapons to Russia. “We have information that gives us concern that they are considering providing lethal support to Russia,” he said.\\nBlinken said he expressed to the Chinese envoy to the meeting, Wang Yi, that “this would be a serious problem.”\\nNATO’s chief said Wednesday he had seen some signs that China may be ready to provide arms and warned that would be it would be supporting a violation of international law.\\nRussian and Chinese forces have held joint drills since the invasion, most recently with the South African navy in a shipping lane off the South African coast.\\nUkraine’s defense minister Oleksii Reznikov expressed doubt about U.S. concerns Monday.\\n“I’m not sure because Russia needs also helmets, life vests, etc., etc. And I think that if China will help them … it will not (be) the weaponry. It will (be) some kinds of like clothes,” Reznikov said in Kyiv.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUkraine’s president pledged to push for victory in 2023 as he and other Ukrainians on Friday marked the somber first anniversary of the Russian invasion that he called “the longest day of our lives.”\\nAs morning broke on a day of commemorations and reflection, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy struck a tone of grim defiance and used the anniversary to congratulate Ukrainians on their resilience in the face of Europe’s biggest and deadliest war since World War II. He said they had proven themselves to be invincible in what he called “a year of pain, sorrow, faith and unity.”\\n“We survived the first day of the full-scale war. We didn’t know what tomorrow would bring, but we clearly understood that for each tomorrow, you need to fight. And we fought,” he said in an early morning video address.\\nIt was “the longest day of our lives. The hardest day of our modern history. We woke up early and haven’t fallen asleep since,” he said.\\nUkrainians planned memorials, candle vigils and other remembrances for their tens of thousands of dead — a toll growing all the time as fighting rages in eastern Ukraine in particular.\\nThere were concerns that Russia might unleash another barrage of missiles against Ukraine to pile yet more sadness on the day.\\nMercifully, air raid alarms did not sound overnight in the capital, Kyiv, and the sad morning started quietly.\\nStill, the government recommended that schools move classes online, and office employees were asked to work from home.\\nTributes to Ukraine’s resilience flowed from overseas. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was among monuments illuminated in Ukraine’s colors — yellow and blue.\\nZelenskyy got an early start on the day, firing off a tweet that promised: “We know that 2023 will be the year of our victory!”\\nHe followed that up with his video address in which he pledged not to abandon Ukrainians living under Russian occupation.\\nUkraine “has not forgotten about you, has not given up on you. One way or another, we will liberate all our lands,” he said.\\nA year on, casualty figures are horrific on both sides, with Western estimates suggesting hundreds of thousands of killed and wounded.\\nEconomic repercussions have rippled across the globe. Diplomatic repercussions, too. Western nations are supporting Ukraine militarily, financially and politically. But China, India and countries in the global south have proven ambivalent about Western arguments that Ukraine is the front line of a fight for freedom and democracy.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAstronomers have discovered what appear to be massive galaxies dating back to within 600 million years of the Big Bang, suggesting the early universe may have had a stellar fast-track that produced these “monsters.”\\nWhile the new James Webb Space Telescope has spotted even older galaxies, dating to within a mere 300 million years of the beginning of the universe, it’s the size and maturity of these six apparent mega-galaxies that stun scientists. They reported their findings Wednesday.\\nLead researcher Ivo Labbe of Australia’s Swinburne University of Technology and his team expected to find little baby galaxies this close to the dawn of the universe — not these whoppers.\\n“While most galaxies in this era are still small and only gradually growing larger over time,” he said in an email, “there are a few monsters that fast-track to maturity. Why this is the case or how this would work is unknown.”\\nEach of the six objects looks to weigh billions of times more than our sun. In one of them, the total weight of all its stars may be as much as 100 billion times greater than our sun, according to the scientists, who published their findings in the journal Nature.\\nYet these galaxies are believed to be extremely compact, squeezing in as many stars as our own Milky Way, but in a relatively tiny slice of space, according to Labbe.\\nLabbe said he and his team didn’t think the results were real at first — that there couldn’t be galaxies as mature as the Milky Way so early in time — and they still need to be confirmed. The objects appeared so big and bright that some members of the team thought they had made a mistake.\\n“We were mind-blown, kind of incredulous,” Labbe said.\\nThe Pennsylvania State University’s Joel Leja, who took part in the study, calls them “universe breakers.”\\n“The revelation that massive galaxy formation began extremely early in the history of the universe upends what many of us had thought was settled science,” Leja said in a statement. “It turns out we found something so unexpected it actually creates problems for science. It calls the whole picture of early galaxy formation into question.”\\nThese galaxy observations were among the first data set that came from the $10 billion Webb telescope, launched just over a year ago. NASA and the European Space Agency’s Webb is considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, coming up on the 33rd anniversary of its launch.\\nUnlike Hubble, the bigger and more powerful Webb can peer through clouds of dust with its infrared vision and discover galaxies previously unseen. Scientists hope to eventually observe the first stars and galaxies formed following the creation of the universe 13.8 billion years ago.\\nThe researchers still are awaiting official confirmation through sensitive spectroscopy, careful to call these candidate massive galaxies for now. Leja said it’s possible that a few of the objects might not be galaxies, but obscured supermassive black holes.\\nWhile some may prove to be smaller, “odds are good at least some of them will turn out to be” galactic giants, Labbe said. “The next year will tell us.”\\nOne early lesson from Webb is “to let go of your expectations and be ready to be surprised,” he said.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nJanata Samajwadi Party (JSP) leader Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav has been elected vice-president on Friday.\\nThe 52-year-old who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) from Bara-2 has become the third vice-president of Nepal.\\nHe had started his professional career as a teacher in 1991 and was affiliated with Nepal Sadbhawana Party. He was also affiliated in 2002 with the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, Nepal—which was essentially a non-governmental organization founded by Upendra Yadav and not a political party. He became central member and Bara head of Forum the next year while continuing his affiliation with Sadbhawana as people active with other parties could also join Forum.\\nHe had participated in the Jana Andolan II of 2006 while working as teacher and then quit Nepal Sadbhawana Party after the Jana Andolan II. He taught at the Padam Devi Kanya Madhyamik Vidyalaya in Kalaiya, Bara for 17 years before starting active politics with Forum in March 2008.\\nHe was elected to the First Constituent Assembly in 2008 through the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system. He was also in the PR list in the Second CA Election held in 2013, but was not made lawmaker by the party that had suffered multiple splits by then and seen a massive drop in PR votes.\\nUpendra Yadav had urged him to remain in the PR list even in the general election in 2017 but he refused and was elected from Bara-2 through the First-Past-the-Post (FPTP) electoral system.\\nHe is a very simple person, and comes from a family with humble financial background. Many were worried how he would manage election expenses while contesting the election in 2017. “Party Chairman Yadav had assured me that he would pick me as a lawmaker even if the party were to get only one seat through the PR electoral system,” he tells Setopati. “I was even asked to contest the provincial election with promise to make me chief minister. Chairman said he would support me no matter which constituency I would choose after I insisted that I would contest for federal lawmaker.”\\nHe was again elected from the same constituency in the recent general election.\\nYadav, who became forest minister for nine months after the election in 2017, is considered to be a leader with a clean image and impeccable integrity in the party.\\nHe still stays in the same modest rented apartment in Shankhamul, Kathmandu where he had stayed after being elected CA member in 2008. His bedroom does not even have a bed and he sleeps on the floor in a room in the rented apartment.\\n“The rent was Rs 7,000 (per month) then,” he quips. “It has now risen to Rs 22,000.”\\nHe does not own a private vehicle and reaches the Parliament Building in New Baneshwore and the party office at Bal Kumari by foot. His wife Champa Devi Yadav still lives in Kalaiya while his two sons and a daughter live in Kathmandu.\\n“My wife likes to rear cows-buffaloes,” he reveals. “I also went to rear cattle with her after the First CA was dissolved. We come from a farmer family and it is difficult to quit farming. We currently have only one cow as we are trying to build a small home.”\\nHe is a confidant of Upendra Yadav and has never left the party chief since joining Forum in 2002 despite multiple splits in the party. He is among just four of the 25 listed central members while registering Forum as a political party with the Election Commission before the First CA Election. (Chairman Upendra Yadav, Mohammad Ishtiyaq Rai and Ram Bilas Yadav are the other three.)\\nHe was made general secretary of the party by Upendra Yadav in 2009 and remained in the post for 12 years despite the party changing its name multiple times following a series of splits and unifications.\\nHe has been an executive member since the party formed after unification of the then Federal Socialist Forum Nepal and Rastriya Janata Party decided to keep only two chairmen as office-bearers.\\nRai, one of the only four Forum central members currently in JSP, calls Yadav a modest leader of Nepali politics and jokes that he and other leaders call him a ‘cow-leader’ as he is as gentle as a cow.\\n“Everyone recognizes him as a leader with clean and modest image. He is a leader who never goes beyond the party and party’s thinking. He remained in the party through a series of highs and lows for the party,” Rai effuses. “Such persons don’t join politics and would not last even if they join. They don’t become successful even if they last. But he has broken all those assumptions. The party has recognized his simplicity, integrity and working style. This has raised enthusiasm in the party cadres. Sent a message that even a simple leader would be recognized in politics.”\\nRam Kumar Sharma, who was also close to Upendra Yadav in the past, but is now with CPN (Maoist Center), has a slightly different take on his election as vice-president and points that he has been made so for a purpose. Sharma accepts that Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav is a very simple leader who would not harm anyone and deserves to become vice-president but accuses that he has been made vice-president to serve Upendra Yadav’s interest.\\nHe claims that Upendra Yadav, who lost to Janamat Party Chairman CK Raut in the House of Representatives (HoR) constituency of Saptari-2, wants to contest the by-election from Bara-2 that will be vacant after Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav assumes office as vice-president. \\xa0\\nJSP leader Pradip Yadav, however, refutes the allegations.\\nSharma contends that Upendra Yadav picked Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav as the parliamentary party leader despite interest by Federal Council Chairman Ashok Rai as Upendra Yadav wanted to become parliamentary leader after winning the by-election as Rai would not have readily agreed to step down.\\nJP Gupta, who was one of the founding leaders of Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, goes further than Sharma and refuses to even call Ram Sahay Prasad Yadav an honest leader. “A man with conscience would speak against wrongs even if that is not to the liking of anyone. He never spoke against Upendra Yadav’s wishes. He is a yes-man of Upendra Yadav. He has got this opportunity as he fulfills Upendra Yadav’s wishes without ever questioning Upendra Yadav,” Gupta stresses.\\n“There was no reason to send a directly elected lawmaker there. Upendra Yadav saw a safe seat in Bara-2 to go to the House. Upendra Yadav has, therefore, sent him there to fulfill his wishes.”\\n\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n                            Against all odds, love won out at the 90th Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nGuillermo del Toro’s lavish, romantic monster fable “The Shape of Water” swam away with best picture at an Oscar ceremony flooded by a sense of a change for a movie business confronting the post-Harvey Weinstein era.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceremony, held Sunday at the Dolby Theater in Los Angeles, exorcised some demons — like last year’s envelope fiasco — and wrestled with other, deeper problems in Hollywood, like gender equality and diversity.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The Shape of Water,” which came in with 13 nods, took a leading four awards, including best production design, best score and best director for del Toro. He became the third Mexican-born filmmaker to win the award, joining his friends and countrymen Alejandro Inarritu and Alfonso Cuaron — who once were dubbed “the Three Amigos.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“The greatest thing that art does, and that our industry does, is erase the lines in the sand,” said del Toro.\\r\\n\\r\\nJordan Peele won for his script to his horror sensation “Get Out,” becoming the first African-American to win for best original screenplay. Peele said he stopped writing it “20 times,” skeptical that it would ever get made.\\r\\n\\r\\n“But I kept coming back to it because I knew if someone would let me make this movie, that people would hear it and people would see it,” said Peele. “So I want to dedicate this to all the people who raised my voice and let me make this movie.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a year lacking a clear front-runner the awards were spread around. Christopher Nolan’s World War II epic “Dunkirk” landed three awards, all for its technical craft: editing, sound editing and sound design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThings went expected in the acting categories, where Frances McDormand won her second Oscar for her performance in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” McDormand asked all the attending female nominees stand up in the theater.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Look around, ladies and gentlemen, because we all have stories to tell and projects that need financing,” declared McDormand. “I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, Inclusion Rider.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSubbing for last year’s best-actor winner, Casey Affleck, in presenting the best-actress award were Jodie Foster and Jennifer Lawrence. “It’s a new day in Hollywood,” said Lawrence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThree widely admired veteran actors won their first Oscars. Gary Oldman won for his Winston Churchill in “Darkest Hour,” Allison Janney (“I, Tonya”) took best supporting actress, and Sam Rockwell (“Three Billboards”) won best supporting actor. Oldman thanked his “99-years young” mother. “Put the kettle on,” he told her. “I’m bringing Oscar home.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut many of the show’s most powerful moments came in between the awards. Ashley Judd, Anabella Sciorra and Salma Hayek — who all made allegations of sexual misconduct against Weinstein — together assembled for a mid-show segment dedicated to the #MeToo movement that has followed the downfall of Weinstein, long an Oscar heavyweight. They were met by a standing ovation.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We work together to make sure the next 90 years empower these limitless possibilities of equality, diversity, inclusion and intersectionality,” said Judd. “That’s what this year has promised us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nHost Jimmy Kimmel opened with a monologue that mixed Weinstein punchlines with earnest comments about reforming gender equality in Hollywood. And of course, Kimmel — returning to the scene of the flub — dove straight into material about last year’s infamous best-picture mix-up.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I do want to mention, this year, when you hear your name called, don’t get up right away,” said Kimmel. “Give us a minute.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBut while Kimmel spent a few moments on the fiasco known as Envelopegate, he expended far more minutes frankly and soberly discussing the parade of sexual harassment allegations in the wake of the revelations regarding Weinstein. Kimmel cited the industry’s poor record for female directors and equal pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We can’t let bad behavior slide anymore,” said Kimmel. “The world is watching us.”\\r\\n\\r\\nGesturing to a giant statue on the stage, he praised Oscar, himself for keeping “his hands where you can see them” and for having “no penis at all.” But Kimmel introduced the broadcast as “a night for positivity,” and cited, among other things, the box-office success of “Black Panther” and “Wonder Woman.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“I remember a time when the major studios didn’t believe a woman or a minority could open a superhero movie — and the reason I remember that time is because it was March of last year,” said Kimmel.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral cinema legends won their first Oscar. James Ivory, 89, won best adapted screenplay for his script to the coming-of-age drama “Call Me By Your Name,” becoming the oldest winner ever. After 14 nominations, revered cinematographer Roger Deakins finally won for his photography on “Blade Runner 2049.” In the category, Rachel Morrison (“Mudbound”) became the first woman nominated for best cinematography.\\r\\n\\r\\nPakistan-born comedian Kumail Nanjiani joined Kenyan-born Lupita Nyong’o to salute the so-called Dreamers — immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children and here without permanent protection from deportation. “Dreams are the foundation of Hollywood and dreams are the foundation of America. And, so, to all the Dreamers out there, we stand with you,” Nanjiani said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLater, Pixar’s colorful ode to Mexican culture “Coco” won best animated film as well as best song for “Remember Me.” Best foreign language film went to Chile’s “A Fantastic Woman,” Sebastian Lelio’s drama starring transgender actress Daniela Vega.\\r\\n\\r\\n“The biggest thank you of all to the people of Mexico,” said director Lee Unkrich to loud applause. “Marginalized people deserve to feel like they belong. Representation matters.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix scored its first feature-film Oscar, with best documentary going to “Icarus,” Bryan Fogel’s investigation into doping in sports, aided by the assistance of Grigory Rodchenkov, the head of the Russian anti-doping laboratory who candidly discussed the doping scheme under Vladimir Putin. Fogel dedicated the award to Rodchenkov, “our fearless whistleblower who now lives in grave danger.”\\r\\n\\r\\n“Darkest Hour” won for best makeup. The period romance “Phantom Thread” won for costume design.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ceremony was the crescendo of one of Hollywood’s most turbulent awards seasons ever — one that saw cascading allegations of sexual harassment topple movie moguls, upended Oscar campaigns and new movements launched to improve gender equality throughout the industry.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo Golden Globes-style fashion protest was held by organizers of Time’s Up, the initiative begun by several hundred prominent women in entertainment to combat sexual harassment. Their goals go beyond red carpets, organizers said in the lead-up to the Oscars. “We did the dress code thing and now we’re doing the work,” said #MeToo founder Tarana Burke on the red carpet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe parade of sexual harassment allegations made the normal superficial red carpet a place of sometimes more serious discussion than attire. Scrutiny fell Sunday on E! host Ryan Seacrest after his former stylist, Suzie Hardy, alleged sexual harassment against the red-carpet regular. Seacrest has denied it and E! has supported him. Best supporting actress Oscar nominee Mary J. Blige said Seacrest is “fighting for his life right now.”\\r\\n\\r\\nTwenty years ago, a “Titanic” sweep won record ratings for the Oscar broadcast. But ratings have recently been declining. Last year’s show drew 32.9 million viewers for ABC, a 4 percent drop from the prior year. Even more worrisome was a slide in the key demographic of adults aged 18-49, whose viewership was down 14 percent from 2016.\\r\\n\\r\\nMovie attendance also hit a 24-year low in 2017. But this year is already off to a strong start, thanks largely to Ryan Coogler’s “Black Panther,” which many analysts believe will play a prominent role at next year’s Oscars. In three weeks, it has already grossed about $500 million domestically. The film’s star, Chadwick Boseman, was placed front-and-center, at the Dolby Theatre.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis year, the academy prohibited the PwC accountants who handle the envelopes from using cellphones or social media during the show.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith just a few minutes before the show started, Kimmel and his team emerged from his dressing room chanting, “Let’s get it right this time!”\\n',\n",

Kumar plays the lead role of a man who starts manufacturing inexpensive sanitary pads after he discovers his wife’s lack of access to them in a small town in southern India.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of menstruation and menstrual hygiene is rarely, if ever, discussed openly in Indian homes.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt pharmacies and department stores, tampons and sanitary pads get the same treatment reserved for condoms — they are handed to customers discretely wrapped in black plastic bags kept on hand simply for the purpose of saving them any embarrassment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many homes women are barred from temples and religious rituals as well as cooking or entering the kitchen when they have their period.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo Kumar and his film are definitely breaking ground in cleaving through the layers of taboo.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Yes, these are pads. Yes, they belong to these amazing women. Yes, they were happy to lend me one so I could stand with them in support of this much needed initiative,” upcoming Bollywood actor Siddharth Malhotra tweeted Friday along with a photo of him surrounded by female fans as he held up a sanitary pad.\\r\\n\\r\\nMalhotra isn’t the only mainstream star to speak up about menstruation. Dozens of other Bollywood actors and actresses have tweeted photos of themselves holding up sanitary pads as they gave the film a shoutout. Radio talk shows have been discussing the film and the shame generally associated with the subject in India.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This, I think is the biggest achievement of #PadMan...men and women breaking the taboo,” Kumar, 50, tweeted of his film.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is loosely based on the life of Arunachalam Muruganantham, who invented a machine to make sanitary pads at a fraction of the cost of most commercially available products, when he found that his wife was forced to use rags and newspaper during her period.\\r\\n\\r\\nKumar’s wife, the novelist and one-time actress Twinkle Khanna, wrote a book on Muruganantham’s life, prompting her husband to make it into a film.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nIndustry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy.

       "  '\\nRescuers with backhoes and bulldozers dug through tons of earth and rubble for 48 people missing after a landslide buried an open-pit mine in northern China on Thursday. CCTV reported that the death toll in the disaster rose to five.\\nConditions in the area remain dangerous, and the search had to be suspended for several hours after a second landslide at the gigantic facility in Inner Mongolia’s Alxa League.\\nOn Thursday afternoon, more than a dozen bulldozers, trucks, SUVs and fire engines were seen passing through a remote police checkpoint around 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of the mine.\\nNearly all personnel were stopped by police and checked for entry approvals before being allowed to proceed further along the road leading to the mine.\\nA police officer said only those with government approval would be allowed access to the area. She said people living close to the mine had been sent to stay in a nearby town.\\nThe initial cave-in of one of the pit’s walls struck at around 1:00 p.m. Wednesday, burying people and mining trucks below in tons of rocks and sand. It was followed about five hours later by the additional landslide, forcing the work suspension.\\nThe official Xinhua News Agency said about 900 rescuers with heavy equipment were on the scene and they had resumed the search by Thursday morning.\\nChinese President Xi Jinping called for “all-out efforts in search and rescue” and for “ensuring the safety of people’s lives and property and maintaining overall social stability.”\\nImages of the collapse distributed by CCTV showed a massive wall of debris rushing down a slope onto people and vehicles below.\\nThe company running the mine, Inner Mongolia Xinjing Coal Industry Co. Ltd., was fined last year for multiple safety violations ranging from insecure routes into and out of the pit, to unsafe storage of volatile materials and a lack of training for its safety staff, according to the news website The Paper.\\nInner Mongolia is a key region for mining of coal and various minerals and rare earths, which critics say has ravaged the region’s landscape of mountains, grassy steppes and deserts.\\nChina overwhelmingly relies on coal for power generation but has tried to reduce the number of deadly mine accidents through a greater emphasis on safety and the closure of smaller operations that lacked necessary equipment.\\nThe cause of the accident remains under investigation.\\nChina has recorded a slew of deadly industrial and construction accidents in recent months as a result of poor safety training and regulation, official corruption and a tendency to cut corners by companies seeking to make profits.\\nDespite those high-profile incidents, the overall number of industrial accidents fell by by 27 percent in 2022, when much of China’s economy was shut down under the zero-COVID policy, over the previous year, the Ministry of Emergency Management announced last month. The number of deaths in such accidents also fell 23.6 percent, the ministry said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nRussian President Vladimir Putin suspended Moscow’s participation in the last remaining nuclear arms control pact with the United States, announcing the move Tuesday in a bitter speech in which he made clear he would not change his strategy in the war in Ukraine.\\nPutin emphasized, however, that Russia isn’t withdrawing from the pact yet, and hours after his address the Foreign Ministry said Moscow would respect the treaty’s caps on nuclear weapons. It also said Russia would continue to exchange information about test launches of ballistic missiles per earlier agreements with the United States.\\nIn his long-delayed state-of-the-nation address, Putin cast his country — and Ukraine — as victims of Western double-dealing and said it was Russia, not Ukraine, fighting for its very existence.\\n“We aren’t fighting the Ukrainian people,” Putin said ahead of the war’s first anniversary Friday. “The Ukrainian people have become hostages of the Kyiv regime and its Western masters, which have effectively occupied the country.”\\nThe speech reiterated a litany of grievances he has frequently offered as justification for the widely condemned military campaign, while vowing no military letup.\\nAlong with limits on the number of nuclear weapons, the 2010 New START envisages broad inspections of nuclear sites. Putin said Russia should stand ready to resume nuclear weapons tests if the U.S. does so, a move that would end a global ban on such tests in place since the Cold War era.\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres responded by calling for Russia and the United States to return to dialogue immediately because “a world without nuclear arms control is a far more dangerous and unstable one.”\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken described Moscow’s decision to suspend participation in the treaty as “really unfortunate and very irresponsible.”\\n“We’ll be watching carefully to see what Russia actually does,” he said while visiting Greece.\\nChina’s U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun called on the U.S. and Russia to “continue to negotiate with each other in finding a good solution.”\\nU.S. President Joe Biden, speaking in Poland a day after his surprise visit to Ukraine, did not mention the START suspension but blasted Putin for the invasion. He pledged continued support for Ukraine despite “hard and bitter days ahead.”\\n“Democracies of the world will stand guard over freedom today, tomorrow and forever,” Biden said at Warsaw’s landmark Royal Castle before a cheering crowd of Poles and Ukrainian refugees.\\nPutin’s announcement was the second time in recent days the Ukraine war showed it could spread into perilous new terrain, after Blinken told China over the weekend that it would be a “serious problem” if Beijing provided arms and ammunition to Russia.\\nChina and Russia have aligned their foreign policies to oppose Washington. Beijing has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion or atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, while strongly criticizing Western economic sanctions on Moscow. Late last year, Russia and China held joint naval drills.\\nThe deputy head of Ukraine’s intelligence service, Vadym Skibitskyi, told The Associated Press his agency hasn’t seen any signs so far that China is providing weapons to Moscow.\\nRussia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and made a dash toward Kyiv, apparently expecting to overrun the capital quickly. But stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces — supported by Western weapons — turned back Moscow’s troops. While Ukraine has reclaimed many areas initially seized by Russia, the sides have become bogged down elsewhere.\\nThe war has revived the divide between Russia and the West, reinvigorated the NATO alliance, and created the biggest threat to Putin’s rule of more than two decades.\\nIn Tuesday’s speech, Putin again offered his own version of recent history, discounting Ukraine’s arguments that it needed Western help to thwart a Russian military takeover. He has repeatedly depicted NATO’s expansion to include countries close to Russia as an existential threat to his country.\\n“It’s they who have started the war. And we are using force to end it,” he said before an audience of lawmakers, officials and soldiers, and broadcast on all state TV channels.\\nItalian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who was in Ukraine on Tuesday, said she wished Putin had taken a different approach.\\n“What we heard this morning was propaganda that we already know,” Meloni said in English. “He says (Russia) worked on diplomacy to avoid the conflict, but the truth is that there is somebody who is the invader and somebody who is defending itself.”\\nAlso meeting with Zelenskyy was the newly appointed chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, who led a delegation for the first time since the start of the war and since Republicans won control of the House of Representatives.\\nChairman Mike McCaul and a handful of other GOP lawmakers said they had a productive meeting about what Zelenskyy needs for winning the war. He provided them with a list of weapons, including longer-range artillery and air-to-surface systems.\\nThe meeting comes as some hard-right Republicans are vowing to block future U.S. aid to Ukraine. “We have seen time and again the majority of Republicans and Democrats support our assistance to Ukraine,” McCaul said in a statement. “But the Biden administration needs to lay out their long-term strategy.”\\nPutin denied any wrongdoing in Ukraine, even after Kremlin forces struck civilian targets, including hospitals, and are widely accused of war crimes.\\nZelenskyy cited fresh attacks on Ukrainian civilians Tuesday, and downplayed Putin’s speech.\\n“I have not watched it, because during this time there were missile strikes on Kherson. Twenty-one people were wounded and six were killed,” he said.\\nPutin also accused the West of taking aim at Russian culture, religion and values. He fired another broadside at Western gender policies that he described as efforts to destroy “traditional” values.\\nAnd he said Western sanctions hadn’t “achieved anything and will not achieve anything.” He blasted Russian tycoons who kept their assets in the West and saw them confiscated or frozen as part of the sanctions.\\n“Believe me, ordinary people had no sympathy for those who lost their yachts, palaces and other assets abroad,” Putin said.\\nWhile Russia’s Constitution mandates that the president deliver the state-of-the-nation speech annually, Putin never gave one in 2022. Last year, the Kremlin also canceled two other big annual events — Putin’s news conference and a highly scripted phone-in marathon taking questions from the public.\\nReflecting the Kremlin’s clampdown on free speech and press, it barred in-person coverage of the address by media from “unfriendly” countries, including the U.S., the U.K. and those in the European Union.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIn the final hours before the Russian onslaught, a last grasp at peace. Russian troops would soon pour across Ukraine’s borders and Russian missiles would fill Ukrainian skies, taking Ukrainian lives in the biggest air, sea and ground assault in Europe since World War II. But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy still appealed, on war’s brink, for reason to prevail.\\nStaring intently into the camera in a last-ditch, dead-of-night, video-recorded plea against the invasion, Zelenskyy warned Russia that the consequences would be “an abundance of pain, filth, blood and death.”\\n“War is a huge calamity,” Zelenskyy said, in what proved to be one of his last outings in a suit before his switch to military-style casual wear. “This calamity carries a huge cost — in every meaning of this word.”\\nThe date was Feb. 24, 2022 — cataclysmic for Ukraine, course-changing for Russia, history-shaping for the wider world. Every hour of every day since has proven those words to be right.\\n___\\nAs milestones go, the invasion’s first anniversary Friday is both grim and vexing. It marks a full year of killing, destruction, loss and pain felt even beyond the borders of Russia and Ukraine — with war-related price shocks being just one example. But it also raises a question that is unsatisfying because it can’t be answered at this partway point: How much longer until this stops?\\n“Not soon enough” might be one response, though any peace deal looks far off as Russia’s invasion force meat-grinds into Year Two, with neither side close to reaching hoped-for objectives.\\nThe misery of 365 days of bloodshed and the full scale of the global repercussions are difficult to sum up with mere words. Russia is more isolated than at any time since the Cold War. Western nations are banding together for Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s defeat while also gambling that the ex-KGB spy won’t go nuclear. China is filing away lessons that could be used against Taiwan.\\nAnd how to measure all the tears? How to adequately describe all the suffering and atrocities? Or even the broken heart of just one of the children who have lost loved ones and futures?\\nThe numbers are dizzying: hundreds of thousands of Russian men escaping abroad to avoid being thrown into battle, millions of Ukrainians uprooted from their homes, tens of billions of dollars poured into weaponry that is making war ever-more lethal, trillions more dollars estimated lost for the global economy. And even those figures don’t do justice to the human and economic costs.\\nOf the body count — surely the most important tally, but kept under wraps by both sides — all that can be said with certainty is that it is horrific. Western officials estimate it to be in the many tens of thousands and growing inexorably.\\nBut Ukraine is still here. That in itself is a stinging defeat for the Kremlin. Putin seemingly believed his forces and secret services would have turned Ukraine into a puppet state by now. The invasion plan called for resistant Ukrainian officials to be liquidated, weeded out or flipped into collaborating, according to a British think tank’s study based in part on captured Russian documents.\\nInstead, the threat of extinction as a free nation is pushing Ukraine into an ever-closer orbit with the European Union, the United States and the wider West — the very outcome Putin wanted to avoid. Each additional delivery of NATO-standard weapons, the billions of dollars in other Western aid, and pledges to stand with Ukraine for “as long as it takes” are hard-wiring bonds that, in peacetime, might have taken many more years to build.\\nUkraine, independent from the ex-Soviet Union only since 1991, has also grown in war as a nation. Fighting to remain Ukrainian has forced clarity about what exactly that means, sharpening the contours of national identity.\\nIn what have become daily video addresses to share news from the fronts and boost morale, Zelenskyy sometimes wears black hoodies emblazoned on the front with the words, “I’m Ukrainian.” Many more Ukrainians have joined the president in ditching Russian for Ukrainian as their primary language. Statues of Russians are also being torn down, street names are being changed and Russian history is being expunged from school textbooks.\\nSays Olena Sotnyk, a lawyer and former legislator: “Putin did for us something which nobody did. He helped us to become a free nation.”\\n___\\nAbroad, too, Ukraine has won hearts and minds, evidenced by the blue-and-yellow flags flying from town halls and the foreign fighters and aid workers risking — and sometimes losing — their lives on Ukrainian battlefields pounded by shellfire into hellscapes hauntingly reminiscent of World War I.\\n“No one will ever confuse Ukraine and Russia (again),” says Mykhailo Podolyak, one of Zelenskyy’s closest advisers. “No one will say, ‘It is something over there, near Russia.’”\\nUkrainians argue that in resisting Putin, they’ve also done the world the favor of unmasking him as a cruel and dangerous foe. The Russian leader who bewitched George W. Bush (“I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy,” the then U.S. president said in 2001 ) and who was chauffeured on a golf cart through the gardens of Versailles Palace by France’s president in 2017, has become a pariah to Western leaders. But others remain close with him, notably Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\\nDespite the failure to secure quick victory, Putin’s grip on power remains firm, with protests quashed and most Russians seemingly rallied behind the war effort. Still, Russia is making previously unimaginable sacrifices.\\nIn battle, Putin has increasingly had to turn to the mercenaries of the notorious Wagner Group, a private military company that has recruited fighters from prisons and tossed them into combat, with high casualty rates. Putin is also losing energy leverage over Europe as it veers away from Russian gas and most Russian oil. Russia’s economy is laboring under Western sanctions. As Putin is boxed in, some fear he could lash out in new ways, perhaps resort to more nuclear saber-rattling or worse.\\nBut history is written by war’s victors. And at this point, the invasion’s outcome is far from clear.\\nOne of Putin’s initial mistakes was trying to conquer a country the size of France with a force that Western estimates suggest was barely larger than the Allies’ D-Day army in World War II. And the mission on June 6, 1944, was far narrower: assault five French beaches, opening the breach from which the Allies then pushed through Nazi-occupied Europe.\\nPutin is now throwing additional equipment and manpower at the problem of his own making, with 300,000 mobilized troops in his pipeline for a new offensive that Russia hasn’t announced — but which Western and Ukrainian officials say is already underway in eastern Ukraine.\\n“Don’t be seduced by ‘plucky little Ukraine,’ because Russia is much bigger. It could just grind Ukraine out,” cautions retired Air Marshal Edward Stringer, a former senior officer in Britain’s Royal Air Force. “It could force Ukraine to run out of bullets by putting one Russian in front of every bullet until Ukraine runs out of bullets before Putin runs out of Russians.”\\n___\\nCertainly, Podolyak says, time is not on Ukraine’s side. Just the opposite.\\n“A protracted war is the slow death of Ukraine,” he says. But the invasion’s first anniversary, he insists, “means that we are on the right track.”\\n“It means that we have a different Ukraine,” he says. “It looks completely different.”\\nSo different that pre-invasion life is an ever-hazier memory. Back then, statues in the capital, Kyiv, hadn’t disappeared behind walls of protective sandbags. People didn’t need to fill bathtubs when air raid sirens sounded so they have water if Russian strikes knock out supplies. They didn’t download phone apps that issue shrill alarms when Russian missiles and killer drones are en route.\\nAnd those same apps didn’t have “Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill announcing when the danger has passed, reassuringly saying in his Luke Skywalker voice: “The air alert is over. May the force be with you.” Surreal.\\nSotnyk, the former legislator, recalls the panic that gripped her when Russia’s missiles first started striking Kyiv a year ago. She called up her mother and ordered her to pack. Now Sotnyk knows better than to dash across town in an air raid.\\n“It’s not like we became braver,” she says. “We (just) became more aware of what does it mean — ‘war.’”\\nBefore the invasion, Feb. 24 hadn’t been much of a mover and shaker as a date in world history. Then Prince Charles and Lady Diana announced their engagement on that day in 1981. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, was born Feb. 24, 1955. In 1938, it was the launch day of the first nylon-bristle toothbrush, “ Dr. West’s Miracle Toothbrush.”\\nBut in 1920, in Germany, it was also the day that Adolf Hitler presented a 25-point platform for the new Nazi Party. Back then, Hitler’s audience couldn’t have known that his speech in a Munich beer hall would prove to be a step toward World War II. Had they guessed, would they have turned back?\\nFeb. 24, 2022, hasn’t led to World War III — not “yet,” pessimists might add. But the past year was, as Zelenskyy forewarned, full of pain, filth, blood and death.\\nAnd ahead: a grim abundance of more to come.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUS President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit Monday to Ukraine to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, a gesture of solidarity that comes days before the one-year anniversary of Russia’s invasion of the country.\\nBiden delivered remarks and met with Zelensky at Mariinsky Palace to announce an additional half-billion dollars in U.S. assistance and to reassure Ukraine of American and allied support as the conflict continues.\\nThe U.S. leader recalled the fears nearly a year ago that Russia’s invasion forces might quickly take the Ukrainian capital. “One year later, Kyiv stands,” Biden said, jamming his finger for emphasis on his stand decorated with the U.S. and Ukrainian flags. “Ukraine stands. Democracy stands. The Americans stand with you and the world stands with you.”\\nThe Ukraine visit comes at a crucial moment in the war as Biden looks to keep allies unified in their support for Ukraine as the war is expected to intensify with both sides preparing for spring offensives. Zelenskyy is pressing allies to speed up delivery of pledged weapon systems and is calling on the West to deliver fighter jets to Ukraine — something that Biden to date has declined to do.\\nZelenskyy said he and Biden spoke about “long range weapons and the weapons that may still be supplied to Ukraine even though it wasn’t supplied before.” But he did not detail any new commitments.\\nBiden’s mission with his visit to Kyiv — and then Warsaw — is to underscore that the United States is prepared to stick with Ukraine “as long as it takes” to repel Russian forces even as public opinion polling suggests that U.S. and allied support for providing weaponry and direct economic assistance has started to soften. For Zelenskyy, the symbolism of having the U.S. president stand side by side with him on Ukrainian land as the anniversary nears is no small thing as he prods the U.S. and European allies to provide more advanced weaponry and to step up the pace of delivery.\\n“I thought it was critical that there not be any doubt, none whatsoever, about U.S. support for Ukraine in the war,” Biden said.\\nThe visit also gives Biden an opportunity to get a firsthand look at the devastation the Russian invasion has caused on Ukraine. Thousands of Ukrainian troops and civilians have been killed, millions of refugees have fled the war, and Ukraine has suffered tens of billions of dollars of infrastructure damage.\\nThe trip also marks an act of defiance against Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had hoped his military would swiftly overrun Kyiv within days. A year later, the Ukrainian capital stands and a semblance of normalcy has returned to the city as the fighting has concentrated in the country’s east, punctuated by cruise missile and drone attacks against military and civilian infrastructure.\\nBiden, a Democrat, also got a short firsthand taste of the terror that Ukrainians have lived with for close to a year, as air raids sirens howled over the capital just as he and Zelenskyy were exiting the gold-domed St. Michael’s Cathedral, which they visited together. Looking solemn, they continued unperturbed as they laid a wreath and held a moment of silence at the Wall of Remembrance honoring Ukrainian soldiers killed since 2014.\\nThough Western surface-to-air missile systems have bolstered Ukraine’s defensives, the visit marked the rare occasion where a U.S. president has traveled to a conflict zone where the U.S. or its allies did not have control over the airspace. It wasn’t immediately clear whether the U.S. had given advance notice of the trip to Moscow to avoid any miscalculation that could bring the two nuclear-armed nations into direct conflict.\\nThe U.S. military does not have a presence in Ukraine other than a small detachment of Marines guarding the embassy in Kyiv, making Biden’s visit more complicated than other recent visits by prior U.S. leaders to war zones.\\nSpeculation has been building for weeks that Biden would pay a visit to Ukraine around the Feb. 24 anniversary of the Russian invasion. But the White House repeatedly had said that no presidential trip to Ukraine was planned, even after the Poland visit was announced earlier this month.\\nSince early morning on Monday many main streets and central blocks in Kyiv were cordoned without any official explanation. Later people started sharing videos of long motorcades of cars driving along the streets where the access was restricted.\\nAt the White House, planning for Biden’s visit to Kyiv was tightly held — with a relatively small group of aides briefed on the plans — because of security concerns.\\nAsked by a reporter on Friday if Biden might include stops beyond Poland, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby replied, “Right now, the trip is going to be in Warsaw.” Moments later — and without prompting — Kirby added, “I said ‘right now.’ The trip will be in -- to Warsaw. I didn’t want to make it sound like I was alluding to a change to it.\\nBiden quietly departed from Joint Base Andrews near Washington shortly after 4 a.m. on Sunday, making a stop at Ramstein Air Base in Germany before making his way into Ukraine.\\nOther western leaders have made the trip to Kyiv since the start of the war.\\nIn June, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and then Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi traveled together by night train to Kyiv to meet with Zelenskyy. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak visited Kyiv in November shortly after taking office.\\nThis is Biden’s first visit to a war zone as president. His recent predecessors, Donald Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, made surprise visits to Afghanistan and Iraq during their presidencies to meet with U.S. troops and those countries’ leaders.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nBeing stuck in traffic is stressful, wastes time and resources and ends up costing the world’s economies trillions of dollars a year. Jams happen daily and authorities have spent decades trying to fix the problem with little success.\\nYet a solution may be literally under our feet. Ants.\\nThere are an estimated 20 quadrillion ants on Earth. That’s more than the number of stars in the Milky Way (and possibly more than the number of stars in the entire observable universe). These ants — which can live in colonies that contain billions of individuals and can span thousands of kilometers — are nearly always moving yet somehow they never get stuck.\\nLike humans, ants have sophisticated transportation systems to ensure the efficient movement of individuals, resources and information.\\nSome ant species create systems using chemical signals called ‘pheromones’. If an ant finds an attractive food source, she returns to the nest dropping invisible droplets of pheromone behind her as she walks.\\nThis is the basis of many ant transportation systems and enables ants to quickly gather workers to new food sources, allocate workers based on the quality of the food, and find the shortest path between points.\\nIn the early 1990s, the trail-laying behavior of ants inspired the incredibly successful ‘ant colony optimization algorithm’ which is now used to tackle tough traffic problems such as determining the most efficient route for a fleet of delivery vehicles. Ants excel at managing traffic on their trails.\\nOn human-built roads the average speed of cars decreases as the number of cars on the road increases: you simply can’t go fast when the road is crowded. Ants moving on their trails, however, do not slow down even when more ants join the trail.\\nHow? In some cases, traffic congestion is prevented because ants switch from using a single trail when traffic is light, to using two trails when traffic is heavy. By dividing themselves across multiple routes, ants maintain traffic speeds and prevent congestion, effectively stopping traffic jams before they start. \\xa0\\nSome ants also respond to increased traffic by leaving less pheromone, which decreases the attractiveness of a trail and may encourage ants to find alternate routes. Other ants appear to adjust their walking speed to avoid time-consuming collisions when ant trails become crowded. \\xa0\\nSome ants manage traffic by traveling along their trails in small groups called ‘platoons’. Platooning is thought to increase the efficiency of ant trail systems by reducing the gaps between individuals. This concept is being investigated for self-driving cars as it reduces the need for sudden braking and helps prevent congestion.\\nIt’s clear ants are masters at managing traffic on their trails but the billion-dollar question is whether we can apply what we learn from ants to our own traffic management systems.\\nThere is one issue: humans are not ants.\\nWhere ants on a trail share a common goal, human drivers are motivated by individual goals that may conflict with other road users. Ants communicate to one another through their trails systems, whereas communication between human drivers is limited.\\nHowever, as we move toward the adoption of self-driving vehicles, the opportunities for ants to inspire traffic technologies will increase. Self-driving cars can communicate with each other to find the best route and avoid congestion, similar to ants using chemical signals to communicate and navigate their trail systems.\\nLike ants in a colony, self-driving vehicles may be able to work together to minimize traffic times for everyone. In essence, our traffic systems may be becoming more ant like. And as our traffic systems continue to adapt, we would be wise to look to the animals whose traffic management prowess has been shaped by millions of years of evolution.\\nTanya Latty is an associate professor at the University of Sydney.

       "  '\\nNorth Korea fired two short-range ballistic missiles off its eastern coast on Monday in its second weapons test in three days that drew quick condemnation from its rivals.\\nThe weapons firings follow an intercontinental ballistic missile launch Saturday and North Korea’s threats to take an unprecedented strong response to U.S.-South Korean military drills that the North views as an invasion rehearsal. Some experts say North Korea could use a new testing spree to expand its arsenal and intends eventually to use its boosted capability as leverage in negotiations the United States.\\nSouth Korea’s military said it detected the two missile launches from a western coastal town, just north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on Monday morning. Japan said both missiles landed in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan and that no damage involving aircraft and vessels in the area was reported.\\nAccording to Japanese and South Korean assessments, the North Korean missiles flew at a maximum altitude of 50-100 kilometers (30-60 miles) and a distance of 340-400 kilometers (210-250 miles).\\nSouth Korea’s military said North Korea’s repeated missile launches are “a grave provocation” that undermine international peace. Japan condemned the launches as a threat to the peace and safety of Japan and the international society.\\nThe U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said the missile launches highlight “the destabilizing impact” of North Korea’s unlawful weapons programs. It said the U.S. commitments to the defense of South Korea and Japan “remain ironclad.”\\nNorth Korea’s state media said long-range artillery units on its western coast fired two rounds cross-country toward the eastern waters on Monday morning, possibly referring to the same activity its neighbors said were missile launches. The official Korean Central News Agency said the North Korean artillery rounds simulated strikes on targets up to 395 kilometers (245 miles) away.\\nThe North said the launches involved its new 600 millimeter multiple rocket launcher system that could be armed with “tactical” nuclear weapons for battlefield use. Some experts viewed the weapons system as a short-range ballistic missile.\\n“The frequency of using the Pacific as our firing range depends upon the U.S. forces’ action character,” Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, said in a statement carried by state media. “We are well aware of the movement of U.S. forces’ strategic strike means, (which are) recently getting brisk around the Korean Peninsula.”\\nCalling the United States “the worst maniacs,” she threatened to take unspecified “corresponding counteraction” in response to the future moves by the U.S. military.\\nShe could be referring to the U.S. flyover of B-1B long-range, supersonic bombers on Sunday for separate training with South Korea and Japan. The B-1B deployment came as response to North Korea’s launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM off its east coast on Saturday in the country’s first missile test since Jan. 1.\\nNorth Korea is extremely sensitive to the deployment of B-1B bombers, which can carry a huge payload of conventional weapons.\\nNorth Korea’s state media said Sunday the ICBM test was meant to further bolster its “fatal” nuclear attack capacity and verify the weapon’s reliability and the combat readiness of the country’s nuclear force. In her earlier statement Sunday, Kim Yo Jong threatened to take additional powerful steps over upcoming military drills between the United States and South Korea.\\nNorth Korea has steadfastly slammed regular South Korea-U.S. military drills as a practice for a northward invasion though the allies say their exercises are defensive in nature. Some observers say North Korea often uses its rivals’ drills as a pretext to hone and perfect its weapons systems.\\nThe South Korean and U.S. militaries plan to hold a table-top exercise this week to hone a joint response to a potential use of nuclear weapons by North Korea. The allies are also to conduct another joint computer simulated exercise and field training in March.\\nHours after Monday’s launches, South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said Seoul placed unilateral sanctions on four individuals and five institutions it said were involved in illicit activities supporting the North’s nuclear arms development and evasion of sanctions. While South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s government has so far placed sanctions on 31 individuals and 35 organizations for supporting the North’s nuclear ambitions, such steps are seen as mostly symbolic considering the lack of business activities between the rivals.\\nNorth Korea has claimed to have missiles capable of striking both the U.S. mainland and South Korea with nuclear weapons, but many foreign experts have said North Korea still has some key remaining technologies to master, such as shrinking the warheads small enough to be mounted on missiles and ensuring those warheads survive atmospheric reentry.\\nIn her statement Monday, Kim Yo Jong reiterated that North Korea has reentry vehicle technology. She also hit back at South Korean experts who questioned whether North Korea’s ICBMs would be functional in real-war situations.\\nKim Yo Jong insisted that the nine hours of launch preparation time after her brother Kim Jong Un ordered it included the efforts sealing the launch site and evacuating people, and was not long because of shortcomings of the missile system itself.\\nLast year, North Korea set an annual record with the launch of more than 70 missiles. North Korea has said many of those weapons tests were a warning over previous U.S.-South Korean military drills. It also passed a law that allows it to use nuclear weapons preemptively in a broad range of scenarios.\\nKim Jong Un entered 2023 with a call for an “exponential increase” of the country’s nuclear warheads, mass production of battlefield tactical nuclear weapons targeting South Korea and the development of more advanced ICBMs targeting the U.S.\\n',\n",

A poster of a stern-faced soldier, with the slogan “Glory to the heroes of Russia,” is a reminder the conflict has dragged on for a year.\\nWestern stores are gone, but customers can still buy their products — or knockoffs sold under a Russian name or branding.\\nThe painful, bruising changes to Russian life require more effort to see.\\nA broad government crackdown has silenced dissent, with political opponents imprisoned or fleeing abroad. Families have been torn apart by the first mobilization of reservists since World War II. State TV spews hatred against the West and reassuring messages that much of the world still is with Russia.\\nAnd Russia’s battlefield deaths are in the thousands.\\nQUASHING THE CRITICS\\r\\n“Indeed, the war has ruined many lives — including ours,” Sophia Subbotina of St. Petersburg told The Associated Press.\\nTwice a week, she visits a detention center to bring food and medicine to her partner, Sasha Skochilenko, an artist and musician with serious health issues. Skochilenko was arrested in April for replacing supermarket price tags with antiwar slogans.\\nShe is charged with spreading false information about the military, one of President Vladimir Putin’s new laws that effectively criminalize public expression against the war. The crackdown has been immediate, ruthless and unparalleled in post-Soviet Russia.\\nMedia cannot call it a “war,” and protesters using that word on placards are hit with steep fines. Most who took to the streets were swiftly arrested. Rallies fizzled.\\nIndependent news sites were blocked, as were Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. A prominent radio station was taken off the air. The Novaya Gazeta newspaper, led by 2021 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov, lost its license.\\nSkochilenko, who says she is not an activist but simply someone horrified by war, faces up to 10 years in prison.\\nProminent Putin critics either left Russia or were arrested: Ilya Yashin got 8½ years, Vladimir Kara-Murza is jailed awaiting trial and Alexei Navalny remains in prison.\\nEntertainers opposing the war quickly lost work, with plays and concerts canceled.\\n“The fact that Putin has managed to intimidate a significant part of our society is hard to deny,” Yashin told AP from jail last year.\\nPUSHING THE GOVERNMENT LINE\\r\\nThe purge of critics was followed by a splurge of propaganda. State TV suspended some entertainment shows and expanded political and news programs to boost the narrative that Russia was ridding Ukraine of Nazis, a false claim Putin used as pretext for the invasion. Or that NATO is acting via puppets in Kyiv but that Moscow will prevail.\\n“A new structure of the world is emerging in front of our eyes,” proclaimed anchor Dmitry Kiselev in a December rant on his weekly show. “The planet is getting rid of Western leadership. Most of humanity is with us.”\\nThese messages play well in Russia, says Denis Volkov, director of the country’s top independent pollster Levada Center: “The idea that NATO wants to ruin Russia or at least weaken … it has been сommonplace for three-fourths (of poll respondents) for many years.”\\nThe Kremlin is pushing its narrative to the young. Schoolchildren were told to write letters to soldiers, and some schools designated “A Hero’s Desk” for graduates fighting in Ukraine.\\nIn September, schools added a subject loosely translated as “Conversations about Important Things.” Lesson plans for eighth to 11th graders seen by AP describe Russia’s “special mission” of building a “multipolar world order.”\\nAt least one teacher who refused to teach the lessons was fired. Although not mandatory, some parents whose children skip them face pressure from administrators or even police.\\nA fifth grader was accused of having a Ukraine-themed photo on social media and asking classmates about supporting the war, and she and her mother were detained briefly after administrators complained, said her lawyer, Nikolai Bobrinsky. When she skipped the new lessons, authorities apparently decided to make “an example” of her, he added.\\nSURVIVING SANCTIONS\\r\\nThe sanctions-hit economy outperformed expectations, thanks to record oil revenues of about $325 billion after the war sent energy prices soaring. The Central Bank stabilized the plummeting ruble by raising interest rates, and the currency is stronger against the dollar than before the invasion.\\nMcDonald’s, Ikea, Apple and others left Russia. The golden arches were replaced by Vkusno — i Tochka (“Tasty — Period”), while Starbucks became Stars Coffee, with essentially the same menus.\\nVisa and Mastercard halted services, but banks switched to the local MIR system, so existing cards continued to work in the country; those traveling abroad use cash. After the European Union banned flights from Russia, airline ticket prices rose and destinations became harder to reach. Foreign travel is now available to a privileged minority.\\nSociologists say these changes hardly bothered most Russians, whose average monthly salary in 2022 was about $900. Only about a third have an international passport.\\nInflation spiked nearly 12%, but Putin announced new benefits for families with children and increased pensions and the minimum wage by 10%.\\nMacBooks and iPhones are still easily available, and Muscovites say restaurants have Japanese fish, Spanish cheese and French wine.\\n“Yes, it costs a bit more, but there’s no shortage,” said Vladimir, a resident who asked not to be fully identified for his own safety. “If you walk in the city center, you get the impression that nothing is happening. Lots of people are out and about on weekends. There are fewer people in cafes, but they are still there.”\\nStill, he admitted the capital seems emptier and people look sadder.\\n‘IN THE TRENCHES, OR WORSE’\\r\\nPerhaps the biggest shock came in September, when the Kremlin mobilized 300,000 reservists. Although billed as a “partial” call-up, the announcement sent panic through the country since most men under 65 — and some women — are formally part of the reserve.\\nFlights abroad sold out in hours and long lines formed at Russia’s border crossings. Hundreds of thousands were estimated to have left the country in the following weeks.\\nNatalia, a medical worker, left Moscow with her boyfriend after a summons was delivered to his mother. Their income was cut in half and she misses home, but they’ve decided to try it for a year, said the woman, who asked that her last name and location not be revealed for their safety.\\n“Between ourselves, we’re saying that once things calm down, we will be able to come back. But it wouldn’t resolve the rest of it. That huge snowball is rolling downhill, and nothing will be back (as it was),” Natalia said.\\nDraftees complained of poor living conditions at bases and shortages of gear. Their wives and mothers claimed they were deployed to the front without proper training or equipment and were quickly wounded.\\nA woman who is contesting her husband being drafted said her family life fell apart after she suddenly had to care for her children and frail mother-in-law.\\n“It was hard. I thought I’d lose my mind,” said the woman, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his legal case is continuing. Her husband came home on leave — suffering from pneumonia — and needs psychological care because he jumps at every loud sound, she said.\\nVasily, a 33-year-old Muscovite, learned authorities tried twice this month to deliver a summons to a former apartment where he is officially registered. Although not sure if the summons was to draft him or to clear up his enlistment records, especially after a September attempt to deliver call-up papers, he doesn’t intend to find out.\\n“All my friends who went (to the enlistment office) to figure it out are in the trenches now, or worse,” added Vasily, who withheld his last name for his own safety.\\nVolkov, the pollster, said the dominating sentiment among Russians is that the war is “somewhere far away, it is not affecting us directly.”\\nWhile anxiety over the invasion and mobilization came and went over the year, “people started feeling again that it indeed doesn’t affect everyone. ’We’re off the hook. Well, thank god, we’re moving on with our lives.’”\\nSome fear a new mobilization, which the Kremlin denies.\\nLIVES LOST\\r\\nAs the war became bogged down by defeats and setbacks, families got the worst news possible: a loved one was killed.\\nFor one mother, it was too much to bear.\\nShe told AP she became “hysterical” and “started shaking” when told her son was missing and presumed dead while serving on the Moskva, the missile cruiser that sank in April. The woman, who at the time spoke on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisal, said she found it hard to believe he was killed.\\nThe military has confirmed just over 6,000 deaths, but Western estimates are in the tens of thousands. Putin promised generous compensation to families of those listed as killed in action — 12 million rubles (about $160,000).\\nIn November, he met with a dozen mothers, which Russian media said were hand-picked among Kremlin supporters and officials, and told one of them her son’s death wasn’t in vain.\\n“With some people ... it is unclear why they die -– because of vodka or something else. When they are gone, it is hard to say whether they lived or not -– their lives passed without notice,” he told her. “But your son did live – do you understand? He achieved his goal.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0The United States has determined that Russia has committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine, Vice President Kamala Harris said Saturday, insisting that “justice must be served” to the perpetrators.\\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference, Harris said the international community has both a moral and a strategic interest in pursuing those crimes, pointing to a danger of other authoritarian governments taking advantage if international rules are undermined.\\n“Russian forces have pursued a widespread and systemic attack against a civilian population — gruesome acts of murder, torture, rape, and deportation,” Harris said. She also cited “execution-style killings, beatings, and electrocution.”\\nThe Biden administration formally determined last March that Russian troops had committed war crimes in Ukraine and said it would work with others to prosecute offenders. A determination of crimes against humanity goes a step further, indicating that attacks against civilians are being carried out in a widespread and systematic manner.\\n“Russian authorities have forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of people, from Ukraine to Russia, including children,” Harris said. “They have cruelly separated children from their families.”\\nShe also pointed to the attack in mid-March on a theater in the strategic port city of Mariupol where civilians had been sheltering, which killed hundreds, and to the images of civilians’ bodies left on the streets of Bucha after the Russian pullback from the Kyiv area last spring.\\nHarris said that as a former prosecutor and former head of California’s Department of Justice, she knows “the importance of gathering facts and holding them up against the law.”\\n“In the case of Russia’s actions in Ukraine, we have examined the evidence, we know the legal standards, and there is no doubt,” she said. “These are crimes against humanity.”\\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who also was attending the Munich conference, said in a statement issued as Harris spoke that “we reserve crimes against humanity determinations for the most egregious crimes.”\\nThe new determination underlines the “staggering extent” of suffering inflicted on Ukrainian civilians and “also reflects the deep commitment of the United States to holding members of Russia’s forces and other Russian officials accountable for their atrocities,” he said.\\nIn an address to his country on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv this week had gotten “strong signals from our partners, specific agreements on the inevitability of holding Russia accountable for aggression, for terror against Ukraine and its people.”\\n“Every Russian attack … on every corner of our state will have concrete legal consequences for the terrorist state,” Zelenskyy said, citing attacks not just in the past year of war but dating back to 2014, when fighting with Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine first broke out.\\nThe president did not refer specifically to Harris’ remarks or name any countries that had provided agreements on Russian accountability.\\nRussia’s nearly yearlong invasion of Ukraine, has dominated discussions at the Munich conference, an annual gathering of security and defense officials from around the world. Harris told the assembled participants: “Let us all agree — on behalf of all the victims, both known and unknown, justice must be served.”\\n“Such is our moral interest,” she said. “We also have a significant strategic interest.”\\nIf Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeds in attacking international rules and norms, she said, “other authoritarian powers could seek to bend the world to their will, through coercion, disinformation and even brute force.”\\nHarris’ audience Saturday didn’t include any Russian officials. Conference organizers decided not to invite them this year.\\nWhile Western officials defended arms supplies to Ukraine, China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, called for an end to the war through peace talks, saying Beijing was “deeply worried about the expansion and long-term effect of this war.”\\nChina has refused to condemn Russia’s invasion of Ukraine or to impose sanctions on Moscow like Western nations have done. Without naming any countries, Wang said “there may be forces” that don’t want the war to stop anytime soon.\\n“What they care about is not the life and death of the Ukrainian people, nor the increasing damage to Europe. They probably have bigger strategic goals than Ukraine,” he said.\\nAsked on the sidelines of the event about the U.S. determination of crimes against humanity, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba replied that “Russia waged a genocidal war against Ukrainians because they do not recognize our identity and they do not think we deserve to exist as a sovereign nation.”\\n“Everything that stems from that is crimes against humanity, war crimes and various other atrocities committed by the Russian army in the territory of Ukraine,” he said. “Let lawyers sort out specifically which act belongs where in terms of legal qualification.”\\nZelenskyy had urged Western allies in a video address to the conference on Friday to quicken their military support for Ukraine.\\nKuleba voiced confidence that Ukraine would eventually receive fighter jets from its partners, despite their current reluctance. He noted that they initially pushed back on providing other heavy weapons that were later delivered or promised.\\nIn Munich on Friday, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, called for cluster munitions and phosphorous bombs, German media reported. Cluster munitions are banned by an international treaty.\\nAsked whether he supported calling for such weapons, Kuleba said Ukraine has evidence that Russia uses them.\\n“We are not party to the convention on the prohibition of cluster ammunition, so legally there are no obstacles for that,” he said. “And if we receive one, we will be using it exclusively against military forces of the Russian Federation.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nTaking a swig from your plastic water bottle will do more than slake your thirst — you will also be gulping down an unhealthy dose of microplastics — tiny plastic particles measuring less than 5mm.\\nBeing plastic, these particles do not decompose all that easily and will accumulate over time in our bodies — a process called bioaccumulation.\\nWhile there is not yet any clear evidence between microplastics and serious illnesses, researchers are increasingly concerned over their long-term effects on our bodies.\\n\\r\\nKey to this concern are the chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics, some of which have already been linked to serious diseases.\\nThe presence of microplastics in human stool suggests we are exposed to microplastics in our daily lives. They have found their way into the food chain, raising concerns about food safety.\\nThey are also present in bottled water globally. Studies investigating microplastics in bottled water have reported particle sizes of less than 1mm in most, released from the bottle material, the bottleneck and the cap.\\nThe color of the particles coming from the bottle material itself is transparent while those originating from the caps are either blue or green.\\nThe highest detected plastics polymer is polyethylene terephthalate (PET) which is used to manufacture both the bottle material and cap. \\xa0\\nStudies also provide evidence that microplastic in bottled water is due to multiple factors such as physical stress during transport, bottle shaking and high-pressure water injection into the bottles at the production plants.\\nAdditionally, thermal impact during storage also worsens the fragmentation process.\\nReusable PET water bottles have higher microplastic particles than single-use PET bottles. Frequent opening and closing of the bottles also cause more particles to be formed due to friction.\\nThe critical question remains unanswered: to what extent do microplastic particles found in bottled water threaten human health? Researchers have developed a number of hypotheses on both the physical and chemical hazards.\\nNo published study has directly studied the impact of plastic particles on humans. The only existing research relies on laboratory tests that expose cells or human tissues to microplastics or those that employ rodents.\\nAccording to the World Health Organization, only microplastics with particle sizes smaller than 1.5 μm (1.5 micrometres) can be ingested or absorbed due to their solubility and excreted directly.\\nThus ingested microplastic particles (<1.5 μm) from bottled water are capable of migrating through the intestinal wall and reaching various body tissues, including the gut, liver and lymph nodes.\\nMinute particles (<1.5 μm) which enter cells or tissues might irritate just by being a foreign presence causing lung tissue inflammation which could lead to cancer.\\nThe accumulation of these particles in human tissues has been linked with chemical toxicity. Compounds such as plasticisers, stabilizers and pigments used in the production can be released by microplastics and travel through our bodies in the bloodstream.\\nThese chemicals have been linked to health problems such as inflammation, genotoxicity, oxidative stress and damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\\nChemicals released from bottled water packaging materials are now known as emerging pollutants and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) that can cause serious health problems including cancer and developmental defects.\\nThe long-term effects of microplastics exposure on human health are not yet fully understood and research is progressing. But it is clear they are a potential hazard and steps should be taken to limit our exposure to them in daily life.\\nIn the event you use bottled water as your primary source of drinking water, you should make an effort to minimize the shaking movements of the bottles and also unnecessarily opening and closing the bottle.\\nAnd it is not recommended to reuse plastic water bottles. Reuse increases the rate of inner surface abrasion, releasing additional microplastic particles from the inner surface of the bottle.\\nIt is also essential to store bottles in a cool and dry place to minimize their exposure to heat and sunlight. Sunlight can accelerate bottle degradation — they become more brittle and fragile — which leads to more microplastic particle release.\\nAdditionally, the heat also causes these PET bottles to leach chemical pollutants such as plasticizers which can contaminate the water.

       "  '\\nUS President Joe Biden said Thursday that the U.S. is developing “sharper rules” to track, monitor and potentially shoot down unknown aerial objects, following three weeks of high-stakes drama sparked by the discovery of a suspected Chinese spy balloon transiting much of the country.\\nThe president has directed national security adviser Jake Sullivan to lead an “interagency team” to review U.S. procedures after the U.S. shot down the Chinese balloon, as well as three other objects that Biden said the U.S. now believes are most likely “benign” objects launched by private companies or research institutions.\\nWhile not expressing regret for downing the three still-unidentified objects, Biden said he hoped the new rules would help “distinguish between those that are likely to pose safety and security risks that necessitate action and those that do not.”\\n“Make no mistake, if any object presents a threat to the safety and security of the American people I will take it down,” he added, repeating the legal justification cited for the downings — that the objects, flying between 20,000 and 40,000 feet posed a remote risk to civilian planes.\\nThe downing of the Chinese surveillance craft was the first known peacetime shootdown of an unauthorized object in U.S. airspace — a feat repeated three times a week later.\\nBiden sharply criticized China’s surveillance program, saying the shootdown sent a “clear message, the violation of our sovereignty is unacceptable,” but said he looks to maintain open lines of communication with Beijing. Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed his first planned trip to China as the balloon was flying over the U.S., and a new meeting with his Chinese counterpart has yet to be scheduled.\\n“I expect to be speaking with President Xi and I hope we can get to the bottom of this,” Biden said, adding, “But I make no apologies for taking down that balloon.”\\nBiden said the rules would remain classified so as not to “give a roadmap to our enemies to try to evade our defenses.”\\nRep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said he expected the U.S. would keep its radar systems set going forward to detect slow-moving balloons as well as fast-moving aircraft and other possible intruders. But he said he had impressed on White House officials late Tuesday that security forces would have to fine-tune their response for when they spot balloons of unknown provenance.\\n“The White House scrambling fighters and tankers” and special forces, he said, “is not going to be a scalable solution to every bit of airborne junk.”\\nThe Chinese balloon has escalated tensions between the U.S. and China. Blinken travels Thursday to the Munich Security Conference and there is speculation he might use the opportunity to meet top Chinese foreign policy official Wang Yi, who will also be attending the conference.\\nBiden had remained largely silent on the objects downed Friday off the coast of Alaska, Saturday over Canada and Sunday over Lake Huron. On Monday, the White House announced earnestly there was no indication of “aliens or extraterrestrial activity.” By Wednesday, U.S. officials said they were still working to locate the wreckage from the objects, but that they expected all three to be unrelated to surveillance efforts.\\n“The intelligence community is considering as a leading explanation that these could just be balloons tied to some commercial or benign purpose,” said White House national security spokesman John Kirby. No country or private company has come forward to claim any of the objects, Kirby said. They do not appear to have been operated by the U.S. government.\\nStill unaddressed are questions about the original balloon, including what spying capabilities it had and whether it was transmitting signals as it flew over sensitive military sites in the United States. It was believed by American intelligence to have initially been on a track toward the U.S. territory of Guam, according to a U.S. official.\\nThe U.S. tracked it for several days after it left China, said the official, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. It appears to have been blown off its initial trajectory and ultimately flew over the continental U.S., the official said.\\nBalloons and other unidentified objects have been previously spotted over Guam, a strategic hub for the U.S. Navy and Air Force in the western Pacific.\\nIt’s unclear how much control China retained over the balloon once it veered from its original trajectory. A second U.S. official said the balloon could have been externally maneuvered or directed to loiter over a specific target, but it’s unclear whether Chinese forces did so.\\nAfter the balloon was shot down, the White House revealed that such balloons had traversed U.S. territory at least three times during President Donald Trump’s administration unknown to Trump or his aides — and that others have flown over dozens of nations across five continents. Kirby emphasized Monday that they were only detected by the Biden administration.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nChina and Iran have urged mutual neighbor Afghanistan to end restrictions on women’s work and education.\\nThe call came in a joint statement Thursday issued at the close of a visit to Beijing by Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi during which the two sides affirmed close economic and political ties and their rejection of Western standards of human rights and democracy.\\nSince taking over Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban has banned women and girls from universities and schools after the sixth grade and forced out those in elected offices and other prominent positions.\\n“The two sides ... called on the Afghan rulers to form an inclusive government in which all ethnic groups and political groups actually participate, and cancel all discriminatory measures against women, ethnic minorities and other religions,” the statement said, adding that the U.S. and its NATO allies “should be responsible for the current situation in Afghanistan.”\\nThe U.S. had backed Afghanistan’s elected government against the Taliban, but withdrew amid the rising costs and dwindling domestic support for a government that was unable to counter a Taliban revival.\\nThe call for women’s rights is notable coming from Iran’s hardline Shiite Muslim regime, which has been challenged by months of protests sparked by the death of a young woman in police custody for allegedly violating clothing requirements.\\nThe country’s theocracy has executed at least four men since the demonstrations began in September over the death of Mahsa Amini. All have faced internationally criticized, rapid, closed-door trials.\\nThe bulk of the China-Iran joint statement emphasized strong political and economic ties, the quest for peace and justice in the Middle East and denuclearization in spite of Tehran’s alleged drive to produce atomic weapons.\\nIn a meeting earlier with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Raisi expressed support for China’s crackdown on democracy in Hong Kong and claim to self-ruling democratic Taiwan.\\nChina and Iran portray themselves, alongside Moscow, as counterweights to American power, and have given tacit, and in Iran’s case, material support to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\\n“China supports Iran in safeguarding national sovereignty” and “resisting unilateralism and bullying,” Xi said in a statement carried by Chinese state TV on its website.\\nXi and Raisi attended the signing of 20 cooperation agreements including on trade and tourism, the Chinese government announced. Those add to a 25-year strategy agreement signed in 2021 to cooperate in developing oil, industry and other fields.\\nChina is one of the biggest buyers of Iranian oil and a major source of investment.\\nIran has struggled for years under trade and financial sanctions imposed by Washington and other Western governments. The U.S. government cut off Iran’s access to the network that connects global banks in 2018.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAn Egyptian widow is struggling to afford meat and eggs for her five children. An exasperated German laundry owner watches as his energy bill jumps fivefold. Nigerian bakeries have shut their doors, unable to afford the exorbitant price of flour.\\nOne year after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and caused widespread suffering, the global economy is still enduring the consequences — crunched supplies of grain, fertilizer and energy along with more inflation and economic uncertainty in a world that was already contending with too much of both.\\nAs dismal as the war’s impact has been, there’s one consolation: It could have been worse. Companies and countries in the developed world have proved surprisingly resilient, so far avoiding the worst-case scenario of painful recession.\\nBut in emerging economies, the pain has been more intense.\\nIn Egypt, where nearly a third of the population lives in poverty, Halima Rabie has struggled for years to feed her five school-age children. Now, the 47-year-old widow has cut back on even the most basic groceries as prices keep rising.\\n“It’s become unbearable,” Rabie said, heading to her job as a cleaner at a state-run hospital in Cairo’s twin city of Giza. “Meat and eggs have become a luxury.”\\nIn the United States and other wealthy countries, a painful surge in consumer prices, fueled in part by the war’s effect on oil prices, has steadily eased. It’s buoyed hopes that U.S. Federal Reserve inflation fighters will relent on interest rate increases that have threatened to tip the world’s biggest economy into recession and sent other currencies tumbling against the dollar.\\nChina also dropped draconian zero-COVID lockdowns late last year that hobbled growth in the second-largest economy.\\nSome good fortune has helped, too: A warmer-than-usual winter has helped lower natural gas prices and limit the damage from an energy crisis after Russia largely cut off gas to Europe. Still, oil and gas prices were high enough to cushion the impact on the energy-exporting Russian economy\\nThe war “is a human catastrophe,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “But its impact on the world economy is a passing shock.’’\\nStill, in ways big and small, the war is causing pain. In Europe, for example, natural gas prices are still three times what they were before Russia started massing troops on Ukraine’s border.\\nSven Paar, who runs a commercial laundry in Walduern, southwest Germany, is facing a gas bill this year of about 165,000 euros ($176,000) — up from 30,000 euros ($32,000) last year — to run 12 heavy-duty machines that can wash 8 tons of laundry a day.\\n“We have passed the prices on, one to one, to our customers,” Paar said.\\nSo far, he has been able to keep his customers after showing them the energy bills that accompany the price increases.\\n“Fingers crossed, it’s working so far,” he said. “At the same time, the customers groan, and they have to pass the costs on to their own customers.”\\nWhile he’s kept his steady customers, they’re offering less business. Restaurants with fewer customers need fewer tablecloths washed. Several hotels closed in February rather than pay heating costs during their slow season, meaning fewer hotel sheets to clean.\\nPunishingly high food prices are inflicting particular hardship on the poor. The war has disrupted wheat, barley and cooking oil from Ukraine and Russia, major global suppliers for Africa, the Middle East and parts of Asia where many struggle with food insecurity. Russia also was the top supplier of fertilizer.\\nWhile a U.N.-brokered deal has allowed some food shipments from the Black Sea region, it’s up for renewal next month.\\nIn Egypt, the world’s No. 1 wheat importer, Rabie took a second job at a private clinic in July but still struggles to keep up with rising prices. She earns less than $170 a month.\\nRabie said she cooks meat once a month and has resorted to cheaper byproducts to ensure her children get protein. But even those are becoming harder to find.\\nThe government urged Egyptians to try chicken feet and wings as an alternative source of protein — a suggestion met with scorn on social media but that also led to a spike in demand.\\n“Even the feet have become expensive,” Rabie said.\\nIn Nigeria, a top importer of Russian wheat, average food prices skyrocketed 37% last year. Bread prices have doubled in some places amid wheat shortages.\\n“People have huge decisions to make,” said Alexander Verhes, who runs Life Flour Mill Limited in the southern Delta state. “What food do they buy? Do they spend it on food? Schooling? Medication?”\\nAt least 40% of bakeries in the Nigerian capital of Abuja shut down after the price of flour jumped about 200%.\\n“The ones still in the business are doing so at breaking point with no profits,” said Mansur Umar, chairman of the bakers’ association. “A lot of people have stopped eating bread. They have gone for alternatives because of the cost.”\\nIn Spain, the government is spending 300 million euros ($320 million) to help farmers acquire fertilizer, the price of which has doubled since the war in Ukraine.\\n“Fertilizer is vital because the land needs food,” said Jose Sanchez, a farmer in the village of Anchuelo, east of Madrid. “If the land does not have food, then the crops do not grow up.”\\nIt all means a slowing global economy. The International Monetary Fund dropped growth expectations this year and in 2022 that equates to about $1 trillion in lost production. Europe’s economy, for example, “is still experiencing significant headwinds” despite a drop in energy prices and is at risk of falling into recessio n, said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at banking giant Citi.\\nThe IMF says consumer prices jumped 7.3% in the wealthiest countries last year — above its January 2022 forecast of 3.9% — and 9.9% in poorer ones, up from 5.9% expected pre-invasion.\\nIn the U.S., such inflation has forced businesses to be nimble.\\nStacy Elmore, co-founder of The Luxury Pergola in Noblesville, Indiana, said the cost of providing health insurance for eight workers has spiked 39% over the past year — to $10,000 a month. Amid a labor shortage, she also had to raise hourly wages for her top installer from $24 to $30 an hour.\\nInflation-whipped consumers began to balk at paying $22,500 for a 10-by-16-foot louvered pergola — kind of a gazebo without walls — that was sold through dealers. Sales sank last year. So Elmore pivoted to do-it-yourself models, selling directly to shoppers at a sharply reduced price of $12,580.\\n“With inflation so high, we’ve worked to broaden the appeal of our products and make them easier for the average person to acquire,” Elmore said.\\nIn the Indonesian capital, Jakarta, many street vendors know they can’t pass along surging food prices to their already struggling customers. So some are skimping on portions instead, a practice known as “shrinkflation.”\\n“One kilogram of rice was for eight portions ... but now we made it 10 portions,” said Mukroni, 52, who runs a food stall and like many Indonesians goes by only one name. Customers, he said, “will not come to the shop” if prices are too high.\\n“We hope for peace,” he said, “because, after all, no one will win or lose, because everyone will be a victim.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nSouth Korea on Wednesday said that it’s still premature to determine whether the recently unveiled daughter of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is being groomed as her father’s successor.\\nSpeculation about the status of Kim’s daughter, reportedly named Kim Ju Ae and aged about 10, has further intensified since she recently took center stage at a massive military parade in Pyongyang and appeared in soon-to-be-released postal stamps — both events with her all-powerful father.\\nDuring a parliamentary committee meeting in Seoul, Unification Minister Kwon Youngse, South Korea’s top official on North Korea, questioned a belief that she’s being primed as the North’s next leader. Kwon cited Kim Jong Un’s relatively young age – Kim turned 39 last month – and North Korea’s male-dominated power hierarchy.\\n“There are views that (her appearances) are aimed at talking about a hereditary power transition. But considering Kim Jong Un’s age and the fact that North Korea has a much more patriarchal nature than ours, there are also lots of questions about whether North Korea having a woman (prepared to) inherit power now is indeed right,” Kwon told lawmakers.\\nKwon said the girl’s repeated appearances in recent months were more likely meant to shore up public support of Kim’s ruling family and prepare for a future hereditary power transfer.\\nSouth Korean media have speculated Kim Jong Un also has a son who is older than Kim Ju Ae and a third child, likely a daughter. But Kwon said only Kim Ju Ae is her father’s officially confirmed child.\\nNorth Korea disclosed Kim Ju Ae in November by announcing she watched an intercontinental ballistic missile test with her father. She’s since made four other public appearances, including last week’s military parade.\\nState media have called her Kim’s “most beloved” or “respected” child and published a slew of photos and video showing her closeness with her father. She was seen touching Kim’s cheek at an observation stand for the military parade and sitting in the seat of honor at an earlier banquet while being flanked by her parents and generals, in what observers say had been unimaginable in North Korea because Kim is the subject of a personality cult that treats him like a god.\\nDesigns released by North Korea’s state-run Korea Stamp Corporation earlier this week also show Kim Ju Ae being featured in five of eight new stamps that are set to be circulated from Friday to celebrate the November flight test of the Hwasong-17 ICBM, an event she attended. The stamps carried previously publicised images showing the girl holding her father’s hand as they walked near the missile and posing for photos with her father in front of a wall of clapping soldiers days after the Hwasong-17 launch.\\nAfter her first public appearance, the National Intelligence Service, South Korea’s main spy agency, told lawmakers that she was Kim’s second child, according to some of the legislators who attended a closed-door briefing. The spy service later said it believed that by taking his daughter to public events, Kim Jong Un aims to show the public his resolve to hand over power to one of his children in the future, though it assessed the younger Kim’s appearances didn’t necessarily mean she would succeed her father.\\nThe name of Ju Ae matched what retired NBA star Dennis Rodman named Kim’s baby daughter who he said he saw and held during his trip to Pyongyang in 2013. Rodman told the British newspaper the Guardian that Kim Jong Un was a “good dad” to his daughter and that “the Marshal Kim and I had a relaxing time by the sea with his family.”\\nSince its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been successively ruled by male members of the Kim family. Outside studies show only a fraction of top North Korean officials are women, including Kim Jong Un’s younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, and Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. Before Kim Jong Un took power in late 2011, his father Kim Jong Il governed for 17 years, and before him, his father and state founder, Kim Il Sung, ruled for 46 years.\\n“It’s too soon to assume that (Kim Ju Ae) will be his heir because the son has always succeeded the throne in North Korea,” said Duyeon Kim, a senior analyst at the Center for a New American Security in Washington, D.C. “So, we don’t yet know if Kim Jong Un is willing to break tradition regarding the gender of his successor or if she will play a key role to support whoever Kim appoints.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUkraine on Tuesday renewed its appeal to Western countries for fighter jets to help frustrate Moscow’s almost year-long invasion, but won no assurances at a high-level defense meeting in Brussels that it would receive any combat aircraft.\\n“I don’t have any announcements on aircraft to make today,” U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters after chairing a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact group at NATO headquarters, where 54 countries were represented.\\nEven so, Ukraine’s allies pledged more weapons, ammunition and tanks as senior defense officials at the meeting said the war with Russia is approaching a critical stage.\\n“This isn’t about one single capability,” Austin told a press conference, referring to the warplanes. “It’s about delivering all the capabilities that we promised. It’s about integrating these systems together.”\\nThe first challenge, he said, is to make sure all the military aid is used effectively.\\n“It’s a monumental task to bring all those systems together and get the troops trained on those platforms,” he said.\\nAs Moscow musters its forces for a potential push in eastern Ukraine, Austin said Kyiv could launch its own offensive in the spring.\\nWith the war set to enter its second year at the end of next week, Ukraine Defense Minister Oleksiy Reznikov was in Brussels to press his country’s case for fighter jets, holding up an image of a warplane when asked what military aid his country is seeking.\\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pushed hard for combat planes last week when he visited London, Paris and Brussels on just his second foreign trip since Russia invaded on Feb. 24, 2022. His plea came days after Western allies pledged to provide Kyiv with tanks.\\nMoscow’s forces have been pressing in the east of Ukraine while bolstering their defensive lines in the south. The war has been largely static during the winter months, though both sides are expected to launch offensives when the weather improves.\\nUkraine’s dogged resistance and Western weapons and intelligence have helped thwart the Kremlin’s ambitions of securing the entire eastern Donbas region. But the risk remains that in some areas Kyiv’s forces could be overwhelmed by the sheer weight of Russian troop numbers.\\nGen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Russian forces are “struggling mightily” and making only slow progress in the Donbas. “However, they do have numbers” to keep fighting, Milley said.\\nPutin was hoping Western support for Kyiv would fizzle out, Austin, the U.S. defense secretary, said.\\n“Today’s meeting comes at a critical time,” Austin said. “The Kremlin is still betting that it can wait us out.”\\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, asked when he expects Russia’s so-called spring offensive to begin, said that “the reality is that we have seen the start already.”\\n“For me, this just highlights the importance of timing. It’s urgent to provide Ukraine with more weapons,” he told reporters in Brussels.\\nAnother issue occupying the minds of NATO allies is how to keep up a steady supply of ammunition to Ukraine without depleting their own stockpiles.\\nAccording to some estimates, Ukraine is firing up to 6,000-7,000 artillery shells each day, around a third of the daily amount that Russia is using.\\nStoltenberg warned Monday that Ukraine is using up ammunition much faster than its allies can supply it.\\nHowever, the Russians appear short on resources for any major offensive at the moment, the U.K. Ministry of Defense said.\\n“Overall, the current operational picture suggests that Russian forces are being given orders to advance in most sectors, but that they have not massed sufficient offensive combat power on any one axis to achieve a decisive effect,” it tweeted.\\nIn Ukraine, the country’s presidential office said Tuesday that Russian shelling killed at least three civilians and wounded another eight over the previous 24 hours as fighting continued in the south and east.\\nRussian forces shelled 17 towns and villages in the Donetsk region. Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said. “The Russians are destroying everything in their path,” he said.\\nUkraine officials also reported intense shelling and air strikes in Luhansk province, while in the south Russian forces shelled the city of Kherson 13 times over 24 hours, destroying a railway and residential buildings.\\n',\n",

It marks the U.S. plane maker’s third-largest sale of all time, in dollar value, and its second of all time in quantity.\\nAir India is also buying 250 passenger jets from European plane manufacturer Airbus, with the orders championed by the leaders of the U.S., France and India.\\nThe Boeing “purchase will support over 1 million American jobs across 44 states, and many will not require a four-year college degree,” U.S. President Joe Biden said. “This announcement also reflects the strength of the U.S.-India economic partnership.”\\nAir India is seeking to reinvent itself by expanding its operations and modernizing its fleet. The new jets will help the airline’s owner, Tata Sons, compete against upstart discount rivals including India’s dominant carrier, IndiGo.\\n“India is going to be the world’s third-largest market in the aviation sector,” Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a videoconference. Over the next 15 years, it’s estimated that India will need more than 2,000 aircraft, and “today’s historic announcement will help in meeting this growing demand.”\\nThe Boeing order includes 190 737 Max aircraft, 20 of its 787s, and 10 of its 777Xs. The purchase includes customer options for an additional 50 737 MAXs and 20 of its 787s, which would make it 290 airplanes for a total of $45.9 billion at list price.\\nToulouse, France-based Airbus will provide Air India 40 wide-body A350 Airbus aircraft and another 210 narrow-body A320neo planes, Tata Sons Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran said in the call with Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron.\\nAirbus did not disclose financial terms of the deal, which could be worth tens of billions of dollars.\\n“Today is a historic moment for India, for Air India and for Airbus,” Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury said in the call. The size of the order “demonstrates the appetite for growth in the Indian aviation industry. It’s the fastest growing in the world.”\\nChandrasekaran said the A350s will be used to “fly all ultra long distance across the globe.” Single-aisle A320s are typically used on short-haul routes. He said the airline has “significant options” to increase its order.\\n“The order’s massive, but a lot of it is long overdue replacement. Air India is way behind in modernizing their fleet,” said Brendan Sobie, a Singapore-based independent aviation analyst.\\nDemand for air travel in India and elsewhere in Asia has boomed over the past decade, fueled by fast-growing economies that have raised incomes and made travel more affordable for many millions of people.\\nFor Air India, “there’s a lot of catch up to do,” Sobie said. It’s competing with newer budget airlines that moved faster to tap demand on domestic services as well as foreign carriers that are formidable competitors on international routes, he added.\\nTata Sons, India’s oldest and largest conglomerate, regained ownership of the debt-laden national carrier last year. The Tata Group pioneered commercial aviation in India when it launched the airline in 1932. It was taken over by the government in 1953.\\nModi and Macron applauded the Airbus deal, with both saying it’s a sign of the strengthening “strategic partnership” between their countries.\\nMacron called the deal a “new success” and an opportunity to “develop new areas of cooperation with India.”\\nTata is integrating Air India with Vistara, which it jointly runs with Singapore Airlines, and with Air Asia India, which it runs with Malaysian discount operator Air Asia.\\n',\n",

Venugopal, general secretary of the opposition Congress party. “We condemn these intimidation tactics in the harshest terms.”\\nGaurav Bhatia, a spokesperson for Modi’s governing Bharatiya Janata Party, said the BBC shouldn’t have anything to fear if it follows Indian laws. But he added that the history of the BBC is “tainted” and “full of hatred” for India and called the broadcaster corrupt, without offering any specifics.\\nLast month, the BBC broadcast a documentary in the U.K. titled “India: The Modi Question” that examined Modi’s role during 2002 anti-Muslim riots in the western state of Gujarat, where he was chief minister at the time. More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence.\\nModi has denied allegations that authorities under his watch allowed and even encouraged the bloodshed, and the Supreme Court said it found no evidence to prosecute him. Last year, the court dismissed a petition filed by a Muslim victim questioning Modi’s exoneration.\\nThe second portion of the two-part documentary examined “the track record of Narendra Modi’s government following his re-election in 2019,” according to the program’s description on the BBC website.\\nThe program prompted an immediate backlash from the government, which invoked emergency powers under its information technology laws to block it. Local authorities scrambled to stop screenings organized at a number of Indian universities, and social media platforms including Twitter and YouTube complied with government requests to remove links to the documentary.\\nCritics and political opponents decried the ban as an assault on press freedom in India.\\nThe BBC said in a statement at the time that the documentary was “rigorously researched” and involved a wide range of voices and opinions.\\n“We offered the Indian Government a right to reply to the matters raised in the series — it declined to respond,” the statement said.\\nIndia’s Foreign Ministry called the documentary a “propaganda piece designed to push a particularly discredited narrative” that lacked objectivity.\\nMany lawmakers from Modi’s party criticized the program as an attack on India’s sovereignty. Last week, Hindu right-wing nationalists petitioned the Supreme Court for a complete ban on the BBC. The court dismissed their plea, calling it “absolutely meritless.”\\nHuman Rights Watch said earlier that the banning of the documentary reflects a broader crackdown on minorities under the Modi government, which the rights group said has frequently invoked draconian laws to muzzle criticism. In recent years, India’s Muslim minority has been at the receiving end of violence from Hindu nationalists emboldened by a prime minister who has said little about such attacks since he was first elected in 2014.\\nPress freedom in India has been on a steady decline in recent years. The country fell eight places, to 150 out of 180 countries, in the 2022 Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders. Media watchdog groups also accuse the Modi government of silencing criticism on social media under a sweeping internet law that puts digital platforms including Twitter and Facebook under direct government oversight.\\nSome media outlets critical of the government have been subjected to tax searches.\\nAuthorities searched the offices of the left-leaning website NewsClick and independent media portal Newslaundry on the same day in 2021. Tax officials also accused the Dainik Bhaskar newspaper of tax evasion in 2021 after it published reports of mass funeral pyres and floating corpses that disputed the government’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Rozman said the man was not a student or employee and had no affiliation with Michigan State.\\n“We have no idea why he came to campus to do this tonight. That is part of our ongoing investigation,” the deputy chief said.\\nThe shooting at Michigan State is the latest in what has become a deadly new year in the U.S. Dozens of people have died in mass shootings so far in 2023, most notably in California where 11 people were killed as they welcomed the Lunar New Year at a dance hall popular with older Asian Americans.\\nIn 2022, there were more than 600 mass shootings in the U.S. in which at least four people were killed or injured, according to the Gun Violence Archive.\\n“This is a uniquely American problem,” Michigan Gov.

       "  '\\nThe desperate search for earthquake survivors in Turkey and Syria entered its final hours Monday as rescuers using sniffer dogs and thermal cameras surveyed pulverized apartment blocks for any sign of life a week after the disaster.\\nTeams in southern Turkey’s Hatay province cheered and clapped when a 13-year-old boy identified only by his first name, Kaan, was pulled from the rubble. In Gaziantep province, rescue workers, including coal miners who secured tunnels with wooden supports, found a woman alive in the wreckage of a five-story building.\\nStories of such rescues have flooded the airwaves in recent days. But tens of thousands of dead have been found during the same period, and experts say the window for rescues has nearly closed, given the length of time that has passed, the fact that temperatures have fallen to minus 6 degrees Celsius (21 degrees Fahrenheit) and the severity of the building collapses.\\nThe 7.8 magnitude earthquake and its aftershocks struck southeastern Turkey and northern Syria on Feb. 6, reducing huge swaths of towns and cities to mountains of broken concrete and twisted metal. The death toll has surpassed 35,000.\\nIn some areas, searchers placed signs that read “ses yok,” or “no sound,” in front of buildings they had inspected for any sign that someone was alive inside, HaberTurk television reported.\\nAssociated Press journalists in Adiyaman saw a sign painted on a concrete slab in front of wreckage indicating that an expert had inspected it. In Antakya, people left signs displaying their phone numbers and asking crews to contact them if they found any bodies in the rubble.\\nThe quake’s financial damage in Turkey alone was estimated at $84.1 billion, according to the Turkish Enterprise and Business Confederation, a non-governmental business organization. Calculated using a statistical comparison with a similarly devastating 1999 quake, the figure was considerably higher than any official estimates so far.\\nIn other developments, Syria’s president agreed to open two new crossing points from Turkey to the country’s rebel-held northwest to deliver desperately needed aid and equipment for millions of earthquake victims, the United Nations announced.\\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres welcomed the decision by Syrian leader Bashar Assad to open crossing points at Bab Al-Salam and Al Raée for an initial period of three months. Currently, the U.N. has only been allowed to deliver aid to the northwest Idlib area through a single crossing at Bab Al-Hawa.\\nSome 100 kilometers (62 miles) from the epicenter, almost no houses were left standing in the Turkish village of Polat, where residents salvaged refrigerators, washing machines and other goods from wrecked homes.\\nNot enough tents have arrived for the homeless, forcing families to share the tents that are available, survivor Zehra Kurukafa said.\\n“We sleep in the mud, all together with two, three, even four families,” Kurukafa said.\\nTurkish authorities said Monday that more than 150,000 survivors have been moved to shelters outside the affected provinces. In the city of Adiyaman, Musa Bozkurt waited for a vehicle to bring him and others to western Turkey.\\n“We’re going away, but we have no idea what will happen when we get there,” said the 25-year-old. “We have no goal. Even if there was (a plan), what good will it be after this hour? I no longer have my father or my uncle. What do I have left?”\\nFuat Ekinci, a 55-year-old farmer, was reluctant to leave his home for western Turkey, saying he did not have the means to live elsewhere and that his fields need to be tended.\\n“Those who have the means are leaving, but we’re poor,” he said. “The government says, go and live there a month or two. How do I leave my home? My fields are here, this is my home, how do I leave it behind?”\\nVolunteers from across Turkey have mobilized to help millions of survivors, including a group of chefs and restaurant owners who served traditional food such as beans and rice and lentil soup to survivors who lined up in the streets of downtown Adiyaman.\\nThe widespread damage included heritage sites in places such as Antakya, on the southern coast of Turkey, an important ancient port and early center of Christianity historically known as Antioch. Greek Orthodox churches in the region have started charity drives to assist the relief effort and raise funds to rebuild or repair churches.\\nIn Syria, authorities said a newborn whose mother gave birth while trapped under the rubble of their home was doing well. The baby, Aya, was found hours after the quake, still connected by the umbilical cord to her mother, who was dead. She is being breastfed by the wife of the director of the hospital where she is being treated.\\nSuch accounts have given many hope, but Eduardo Reinoso Angulo, a professor at the Institute of Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said the likelihood of finding people alive was “very, very small now.”\\nDavid Alexander, a professor of emergency planning and management at University College London, agreed. He said the odds were not very good to begin with.\\nMany of the buildings were so poorly constructed that they collapsed into very small pieces, leaving very few spaces large enough for people to survive in, Alexander said.\\n“If a frame building of some kind goes over, generally speaking we do find open spaces in a heap of rubble where we can tunnel in,“ Alexander said. “Looking at some of these photographs from Turkey and from Syria, there just aren’t the spaces.”\\nWinter conditions further reduced the window for survival. In the cold, the body shivers to keep warm, but that burns a lot of calories, meaning that people also deprived of food will die more quickly, said Dr. Stephanie Lareau, a professor of emergency medicine at Virginia Tech in the U.S.\\nMany in Turkey blame faulty construction for the vast devastation, and authorities have begun targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed. Turkey has introduced construction codes that meet earthquake-engineering standards, but experts say the codes are rarely enforced.\\nAs the scale of the disaster has come into view, sorrow and disbelief have turned to rage over the sense that the emergency response was ineffective. That anger could be a political problem for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who faces a tough reelection battle in May.\\nTurkey’s death toll has exceeded 31,000, and the health minister said more than 19,000 survivors were being treated in hospitals. Deaths in Syria, split between rebel-held areas and government-held areas, have risen beyond 3,500, although those reported by the government haven’t been updated in days.\\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said U.N. humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths met Monday with Syria’s President Bashar Assad and foreign minister after visiting Aleppo and seeing the devastating damage there.\\nHe stressed that the United Nations doesn’t have heavy equipment for excavations or search-and-rescue efforts “so the international community as a whole needs to step up to get that aid where it’s needed.”\\nIn addition, the U.N.’s humanitarian partners need ambulances, medicine, shelters, heaters and emergency food, water and sanitation and hygiene items, Dujarric said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWith few confirmed details from President Joe Biden’s White House, the downing of three unknown aerial objects in as many days by U.S. fighter jets has prompted wild speculation about what they were and where they came from. It even fell to his press secretary on Monday to announce earnestly there was no indication of “aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”\\nThe president had no public events Monday and has offered little reassurance or explanation of what to make of it all, following the discovery of a Chinese spy balloon crossing the country and the unprecedented peacetime shootdowns that have followed.\\nU.S. officials said they still know little about the three objects downed Friday off the coast of Alaska, Saturday over Canada and Sunday over Lake Huron. But those shootdowns have been part of a more assertive response to aerial phenomena following the balloon episode blamed on an ongoing Beijing espionage program.\\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre did have at least one definitive statement to try to tamp down unrestrained theories: “I know there’s been questions and concerns about this, but there is no — again, no — indication of aliens or extraterrestrial activity.”\\nThe U.S. government insists the three objects did not pose a threat to American security and that even the massive spy balloon provided “limited additive capabilities” to China’s other surveillance programs. Still, they were shot out of the sky “out of an abundance of caution,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said.\\nBiden’s unparalleled decision to shoot down four objects over North America in eight days — when combined with U.S. officials’ efforts to publicly downplay the foreign threat — has furthered the dissonant messages being sent about sensitive efforts to protect the homeland.\\nU.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, acknowledge the confusion, saying the administration wants to keep the American public from becoming unnecessarily worried while also trying to maintain a tough posture toward China.\\nKirby said that while the U.S. has no specific reasons to suspect the aerial objects were spying, “we couldn’t rule that out.” He added that the most recent objects, flying between 20,000 and 40,000 feet, could have posed a remote risk to civilian planes.\\nThat legal justification for the downings — that the objects might imperil civilian flight — is viewed by some officials as such a remote possibility that it raises questions about whether it was a mere pretext for acting tough.\\nBiden “wants to appear tough on China, and this is a good example of where actions speak louder than words,” said Brian Ott, co-author of “The Twitter Presidency: Donald J. Trump and the Politics of White Rage.”\\n“If we find ourselves next year in a presidential debate between the two of them, Trump will try to cast Biden as weak on national security, and Biden will be able turn to Trump and say, ‘How many of these Chinese balloons and unidentified objects did you shoot out of the sky?’”\\nOtt, a professor of communications at Missouri State University, said Biden’s relative silence on the takedown of the Chinese balloon and other objects could be guided, at least in part, by his 2024 reelection considerations. Republicans, from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to right-wing firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized Biden in the days after the Chinese balloon was spotted in U.S. airspace for being slow to act.\\nWhen pressed on whether the decision to shoot the objects down came in response to such criticism, Kirby insisted, “These were decisions based purely and simply on what was in the best interests of the American people.”\\nWith little information to go on, senators in both parties demanded answers as they returned to Washington on Monday.\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that senators would receive a classified briefing Tuesday morning and that Congress would work in coming weeks to get the “full story of what happened.” Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat behind Schumer, said Biden “owes the country some answers.”\\nRepublican McConnell said Biden “needs to communicate and level with the American people.” He questioned what the administration knew about China’s surveillance efforts before the first balloon crossed the country.\\nAfter the balloon was shot down, the White House revealed that such balloons had traversed U.S. territory at least three times during Trump’s administration unbeknownst to the former president or his aides — and that others have flown over dozens of nations across five continents. Kirby emphasized Monday that they were only detected by the Biden administration.\\nJim Ludes, a former national defense analyst who now leads the Pell Center for International Affairs and Public Policy at Salve Regina University, said political parrying is inevitable.\\n“It doesn’t matter what the administration says. People are going to play politics with it and try to score points,” he said. “Either they acted too slowly, or too hastily.”\\nThere’s good reason for the Biden administration to be cautious, Ludes added, noting that the blow-up over the aerial devices comes amid heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. The wrong statement from Biden could destabilize an already fraught situation.\\n“Next time we fly a B-52 down the straits, what does China do?” Ludes said. “There are opportunities for this to become very complex very quickly.”\\nKirby on Monday sought to draw a distinction between the latest objects and the confirmed surveillance balloon, emphasizing their far smaller size, lack of maneuverability and the lack of any indication they were communicating before they were shot down. They were only detected, he said, because the U.S. had adjusted the sensitivity on air defense radars to detect high-flying, slow-moving objects like the surveillance balloon.\\nOfficials have yet to retrieve any parts of the three unidentified objects, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, citing the treacherous terrain, water and weather where they were brought down. U.S. officials could not even say whether they were balloons or some other type of aerial vehicle, and have thus far declined to share imagery taken before they were shot down.\\nAll that is clear, it seems, is that it wasn’t ET.\\nKirby echoed Jean-Pierre on that: “I don’t think the American people need to be worried about aliens with respect to these craft.”\\n',\n",

As it happens, Queen Padmini and Khilji, the sultan, never interact in the film and are in the same frame for just a few seconds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film’s sets were vandalized several times by Rajput groups over the last year and Bhansali was manhandled by a mob.\\r\\n\\r\\nMembers of several small Rajput groups continued to be enraged about the film despite Bhansali’s protestations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey kept finding reasons to be enraged.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film’s trailer showed the queen and her female companions dancing during a religious celebration, which angered some protesters. A demure Rajput queen would never be seen dancing in public. In fact, in the film she is seen dancing only in front of her husband.\\r\\n\\r\\nOthers were angry that during the dance her bare midriff was visible briefly — so the filmmakers used special effects to cover her up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the film’s initial release date of Dec. 1 inched closer, the threats grew and spread outside Rajasthan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn November, Suraj Pal Amu, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party from the northern state of Haryana, offered 100 million rupees ($1.5 million) to anyone who beheaded Bhansali and lead actress Deepika Padukone.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe head of the Rajput Karni Sena in Rajasthan said Padukone should have her nose cut off — a symbol of public humiliation — for being in a film that he said insulted the famed queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nFour Indian states, all ruled by the Hindu nationalist BJP, said they would ban the film because it hurt local sentiments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a while it appeared the film would never be released.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers scrambled to save their expensive extravaganza. A group that included representatives of India’s former Rajput royal families watched the film before the country’s censor board gave it a greenlight. They changed the name from “Padmavati,” one of the names of the queen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey issued full-page disclaimers in every national newspaper, insisting the film paid homage to the valor of the brave queen and the heroic history of the Rajputs.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndia’s top court had to step in and order the states of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Haryana to reverse their bans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the violence continued up until Thursday, with protesters setting buses on fire, damaging some theaters ahead of the release and blocking many national highways.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral theater owners didn’t screen the film for fear of vandalism.\\r\\n\\r\\nS. Prema Swarupa, a 21-year-old college student who braved the early winter chill and fears of violence to watch the film in New Delhi, was puzzled by the protests.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I was definitely scared there would be violence but I can’t understand at all what all the protests have been about. There’s nothing in this film,” he said.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was all for nothing.”\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n                            Morgan Freeman first stood on a stage when he was 8 years old, playing Little Boy Blue in a pageant. That’s when he knew he wanted to be an actor.\\r\\n\\r\\nMore than seven decades later, the now 80-year-old Freeman accepted a lifetime achievement award Sunday from the Screen Actors Guild for the much larger roles he’s played in his career, including his Oscar-winning performance in “Million Dollar Baby.” Freeman was nominated for Oscars four other times, including for his work in “Shawshank Redemption” and “Driving Miss Daisy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nActress Rita Moreno, who presented Freeman with the honor, recalled another lesser-known role Freeman played, acting with her in 1971 on the children’s show “The Electric Company.” She had the audience laughing about a role that would surprise some for the smooth-as-silk, dulcet-voiced Freeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Morgan Freeman, Mr. Elegant. Morgan Freeman, Mr. Debonair, Morgan Freeman playing Dracula. With fangs coming out of his mouth,” Moreno said to laughs before impersonating the creepy voice Freeman would use. “And he talked like this: ’Hello, little girl. I come all the way from Transylvania to scare the daylights out of you.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn a more serious note, Moreno said Freeman was more than just an actor, narrator, producer and humanitarian. “This man is a national treasure,” she said.\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman’s acceptance speech was short. Donning a black baseball cap, Freeman said he wouldn’t try to thank everyone he should because he couldn’t remember all their names.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This is beyond honor,” Freeman said. “This is a place in history.”\\r\\n\\r\\nBackstage, Freeman recalled a tough time in his career, in the early 1980s.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I thought my 15 minutes were up ... I needed to get a job,” he said. “By the time I got down to the moment when you make that decision — give it up — something happened. Paul Newman came along.”\\r\\n\\r\\nFreeman was in Newman’s 1984 film “Harry & Son,” a gig that turned Freeman’s career around.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was almost too late.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarlier Sunday, Freeman said that if acting hadn’t worked out for him, he once thought of a career in driving.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I used to imagine myself being a chauffeur because there came a time I thought it was all over,” Freeman said in a Facebook video taken from inside his car ride to the show. “I thought my career had reached its pinnacle, its peak.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was seven years later that he did become a chauffeur of sorts — driver Hoke Colburn in “Driving Miss Daisy.”\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout his award for lifetime achievement, Freeman wondered back stage if there was a hidden message in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The inference might be, Get off the stage, you’re done,\" he said as reporters laughed. “It might, you don’t know. My hope is that’s not the case, that they’re saying, ‘Congratulations so far.\"\\n',\n",

When the CBFC has passed the film, states can\\'t do it (Prohibit exhibition of film). They can\\'t be a super censor board,\" Rohatgi said.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bench noted in its order that creative content including theatre and cinema are inseparable aspects of Right to Freedom and Expression guaranteed under the Constitution.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe producers had submitted that the movie has undergone changes including in its title as suggested by the CBFC.\\r\\n\\r\\nAsserting that the film has been cleared by the CBFC, the plea said the states cannot impose a blanket ban on a film and its screening can be suspended in a particular area or areas on account of law and order problem, not across the states.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoliticians of all hues, including some chief ministers, recently made public statements on the film, with some of them opposing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe film is based on the saga of the historic battle of 13th century between Maharaja Ratan Singh and his army of Mewar and Sultan Alauddin Khilji of Delhi.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe set of the movie was vandalized twice -- in Jaipur and Kolhapur, while its director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was roughed up by members of the Karni Sena last year.\\n',\n",

Their time is up! Their time is up!” she shouted to a standing ovation. The phrase also referenced the “Time’s Up” initiative led by women in Hollywood and others to combat sexual misconduct; that was at the center of the message actresses sent by wearing mainly black at the Globes on Sunday night.\\r\\n\\r\\nWinfrey said while there was no justice for Taylor, whose attackers were never prosecuted, her truth lived on in the work of civil rights icon Rosa Parks, an ACLU investigator on Taylor’s case.\\r\\n\\r\\n“It was somewhere in Rosa Parks’ heart almost 11 years later when she made the decision to stay seated on that bus in Montgomery,” Winfrey said. “And it’s here with every woman who chooses to say, ‘Me too’ and every man, every man who chooses to listen.”\\r\\n\\r\\nWinfrey, who got her start in television journalism, also thanked the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which gives out the Golden Globes.\\r\\n\\r\\n“We all know that the press is under siege these days, but we also know that it is the insatiable dedication to uncovering the absolute truth that keeps us from turning a blind eye to corruption and to injustice, to tyrants and victims and secrets and lies,” Winfrey said.\\r\\n\\r\\nShe ended on a hopeful note saying “a new day was on the horizon” because of people, some of whom were in the Golden Globes audience, who will “take us to the time when nobody ever has to say ‘me too’ again.”\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Twitter the celebrity reaction was swift and in full support:\\r\\n\\r\\n“Oprah cometh,” tweeted actress Amber Tamblyn, while musician Pharrell Williams called her the greatest of all time.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Let me tell you this room is still vibrating like electricity from that speech,” Ava DuVernay tweeted.\\n',\n",

The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy.

       "  '\\nTurkish authorities are targeting contractors allegedly linked with buildings that collapsed in the powerful Feb. 6 earthquakes as rescuers found more survivors in the rubble Sunday, including a pregnant woman and two children, in the disaster that killed over 33,000 people.\\nThe death toll from the magnitude 7.8 and 7.5 quakes that struck nine hours apart in southeastern Turkey and northern Syria rose to 33,185 and was certain to increase as search teams find more bodies.\\nAs despair bred rage at the agonizingly slow rescues, the focus turned to assigning blame.\\nTurkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said 131 people were under investigation for their alleged responsibility in the construction of buildings that failed to withstand the quakes. While the quakes were powerful, many in Turkey blame faulty construction for multiplying the devastation.\\nTurkey’s construction codes meet current earthquake-engineering standards, at least on paper, but they are rarely enforced, explaining why thousands of buildings toppled over or pancaked down onto the people inside.\\nAmong those facing scrutiny were two people arrested in Gaziantep province on suspicion of cutting down columns to make extra room in a building that collapsed, the state-run Anadolu Agency said. The justice ministry said three people were arrested, seven others were detained and another seven were barred from leaving Turkey.\\nTwo contractors held responsible for the destruction of buildings in Adiyaman were arrested Sunday at Istanbul Airport while trying to leave the country, the private DHA news agency and other media reported. One detained contractor, Yavuz Karakus, told DHA: “My conscience is clear. I built 44 buildings. Four of them were demolished. I did everything according to the rules.”\\nRescuers reported finding more survivors amid increasingly long odds. Thermal cameras were used as crews demanded silence to hear those trapped.\\nIn hard-hit Hatay province, a 50-year-old woman who appeared badly injured was carried out by crews in the town of Iskenderun. Similar rescues in the province saved two other women, one of them pregnant, according to broadcasters TRT and HaberTurk.\\nHaberTurk showed a 6-year-old boy rescued from his wrecked home in Adiyaman. An exhausted rescuer removed his surgical mask and took deep breaths as several women cried in joy.\\nHealth Minister Fahrettin Koca posted a video of a young girl in a navy blue jumper who was found alive. “There is always hope!” he tweeted.\\nRescuers in Antakya, elsewhere in Hatay province, pulled a man in his late 20s or 30s from the rubble, saying he was one of nine trapped in the building. He waved weakly as he was removed on a stretcher as workers applauded and chanted, “God is great!”\\nGerman and Turkish workers rescued an 88-year-old in Kirikhan, German news agency dpa reported. Italian and Turkish rescuers found a 35-year-old man in Antakya who appeared unscathed, private NTV television reported.\\nA child was freed overnight in the town of Nizip, in Gaziantep, state-run Anadolu Agency said, while a 32-year woman was found in a wrecked eight-story building in Antakya and asked for tea when she emerged, according to NTV.\\nThose were the rare exceptions.\\nBackhoes and bulldozers prepared a large cemetery in Antakya’s outskirts as trucks and ambulances brought a steady stream of black body bags. Hundreds of graves were marked with simple wooden planks.\\nHatay’s airport reopened Sunday after its runway was repaired, and military and commercial planes ferried in supplies and will take away evacuees.\\nThere are 34,717 Turkish personnel involved in rescue efforts. On Sunday, Turkey’s Foreign Ministry said they were joined by 9,595 personnel from 74 countries, with more on the way.\\nIn the Syrian capital of Damascus, the head of the World Health Organization warned that the pain will ripple forward, calling the disaster an “unfolding tragedy that’s affecting millions.”\\n“The compounding crises of conflict, COVID, cholera, economic decline, and now the earthquake have taken an unbearable toll,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.\\nTedros said WHO experts were waiting to enter northwestern Syria “where we have been told the impact is even worse.”\\nU.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths, visiting the Turkish-Syrian border Sunday, said Syrians are “looking for international help that hasn’t arrived.”\\n“We have so far failed the people in northwest Syria. They rightly feel abandoned,” he said, adding, “My duty and our obligation is to correct this failure as fast as we can.”\\nIn the town of Atareb, in opposition-run northern Aleppo province, Abdel-Haseeb Abdel-Raheem returned Sunday to his ruined four-story building to try to salvage any valuables but could find only blankets, pillows and some clothes. His aunt and her husband died there, but their three children survived.\\nWith no international rescue efforts in the war-battered region, the 34-year-old had to recover the bodies himself.\\n“You can’t hear someone inside screaming and sit tight. You can’t sit still. You can’t have the heart to hear someone (crying for help) and you do nothing,” he said, sitting above a mound of debris.\\nPolitical disputes have held up aid convoys sent from areas of northeast Syria controlled by U.S.-backed Kurdish groups to those controlled by the Syrian government and by Turkish-backed rebels who have fought with the Kurdish groups over the years.\\nA U.N. aid convoy sent to northwestern Syria through government-held areas was postponed due to obstruction from Hay’at Tahrir al Sham, an al-Qaida affiliated group ruling Idlib province, a U.N. spokesperson told The Associated Press.\\nMeanwhile, U.N. aid convoys continue to cross from Turkey into northwestern Syria through the Bab al-Hawa border crossing. The first U.N. convoy only reached northwest Syria from Turkey on Thursday, three days after the disaster struck.\\nBefore that, it was only a steady stream of bodies coming through Bab al-Hawa: Syrian refugees who had fled the civil war and settled in Turkey but died in the disaster, being returned home for burial.\\nThe earthquake death toll in Syria’s northwestern rebel-held region has reached 2,166, according to the rescue group the White Helmets. The overall death toll in Syria stood at 3,553 on Saturday, although the 1,387 deaths reported for government-held parts of the country hadn’t been updated in days. Turkey’s death toll was 29,605 as of Sunday.\\nTurkey’s Justice Ministry announced the establishment of Earthquake Crimes Investigation bureaus to identify contractors and others responsible for building works. It would gather evidence; instruct experts including architects, geologists and engineers; and check building permits and occupation permits.\\nA contractor was detained Friday at Istanbul airport before he could leave the country. He built a luxury 12-story building called Ronesans Rezidans in Antakya, and when it fell, it killed an untold number. He was formally arrested Saturday.\\nIn leaked testimony published by Anadolu, the man said the building followed regulations and he did not know why it didn’t stay standing. His lawyer suggested his client was a scapegoat.\\nUnder programs that allowed building owners to pay fines instead of bringing them up to code, the government agency responsible for enforcement acknowledged in 2019 that over half of all buildings in Turkey — accounting for some 13 million apartments— were not in compliance.\\nThe detentions could help direct public anger toward builders and contractors, deflecting it from local and state officials who allowed apparently substandard construction to proceed. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government, already burdened by an economic downturn and high inflation, faces parliamentary and presidential elections in May.\\nThe nongovernmental business organization TURKONFED estimated the earthquake damage at $84.1 billion, based on statistics from the devastating 1999 quake in northwestern Turkey, including $70.1 billion in housing and $10.4 billion to gross domestic product.\\nRescue crews have been overwhelmed by the widespread damage that has affected roads and airports, making it even harder to move quickly.\\nErdogan acknowledged the initial response was hampered by the damage, with the worst-affected area 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and home to 13.5 million. During a tour Saturday, Erdogan said such a tragedy was rare, referring to it as the “disaster of the century” in multiple speeches.\\nIn New York City, mourners gathered Saturday at a mosque to remember a family of four from the borough of Queens who were killed while visiting relatives in Turkey. The Council on American-Islamic Relations said Burak and Kimberly Firik and their sons, aged 1 and 2, died in the disaster.\\n',\n",

Bolsonaro was cheered throughout the event.\\nThere has been speculation during recent weeks on when Bolsonaro might return to Brazil, where is the subject of several investigations into possible wrongdoing.\\nHe initially entered the U.S. on a one-month diplomatic visa, which ended Jan. 31. He was accompanied by a team of presidential advisers and his wife, all of whom left Florida last month.\\nLawyers for Bolsonaro told Brazilian media recently that they applied for a tourist visa to extend his stay in the U.S.\\nAmid the speculation about Bolsonaro’s plans, one of his sons, Sen. Flavio Bolsonaro, told Brazilian reporters that he didn’t know when his father would return. “It could be tomorrow, it could be in six months, he might never return. I don’t know. He’s relaxing,” the son said.\\nFor the first time in his more than three-decade political career as a lawmaker and then as president, Bolsonaro no longer enjoys the special legal protection that requires any trial be held at the Supreme Court.\\nBolsonaro is being investigated in four inquiries, which had been in the Supreme Court and were sent to trial court this past week.\\nAmong the inquiries is whether Bolsonaro had any role in inciting the Jan. 8 riot by his supporters who stormed into government buildings in the capital, Brasilia, demanding his election defeat to Lula be overturned.\\nInvestigators are also looking into who organized and financed the mass gathering of Bolsonaro supporters, who came to the capital from all over Brazil.\\nOne of the investigations held by the Brazilian justice is who are the ones responsible for inciting the crimes, as well as who financed people from all over the country to travel to Brasilia.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIbrahim Zakaria lost track of time drifting into and out of consciousness while trapped for nearly five days in the rubble of his home following the massive earthquake that struck Turkey and Syria this week.\\nThe 23-year-old cellphone shop worker from the Syrian town of Jableh survived on dirty drips of water and eventually lost hope that he’d be saved.\\n“I said I am dead and it will be impossible for me to live again,” Zakaria, who was rescued Friday night, told The Associated Press on Saturday from his bed at a hospital in the coastal city of Latakia where his 60-year-old mother, Duha Nurallah, was also recovering.\\nFive days after two powerful earthquakes hours apart caused thousands of buildings to collapse, killing more than 28,000 people and leaving millions homeless, rescuers were still pulling unlikely survivors from the ruins — one of them just 7 months old.\\nAlthough each rescue elicited hugs and shouts of “Allahu akbar!” — “God is great!” — from the weary men and women working tirelessly in the freezing temperatures to save lives, they were the exception in a region blanketed by grief, desperation and mounting frustration.\\nMore than a dozen survivors were rescued Saturday, including a family in Kahramanmaras, the Turkish city closest to the epicenter of Monday’s quake. Crews there helped 12-year-old Nehir Naz Narli to safety before going back for her parents.\\nIn Gaziantep province, which borders Syria, a family of five was rescued from a demolished building in the city of Nurdagi, and a man and his 3-year-old daughter were pulled from debris in the town of Islahiye, television network HaberTurk reported. A 7-year-old girl was also rescued in Hatay province.\\nIn Elbistan, a district in Kahramanmaras province, 20-year-old Melisa Ulku and another person were saved from the rubble 132 hours after the quake struck. Before she was brought to safety, police asked onlookers not to cheer or clap so as not to interfere with nearby rescue efforts.\\nTurkish TV station NTV reported that a 44-year-old man in Iskenderun, in Hatay province, was rescued 138 hours into his ordeal. Crying rescuers called it a miracle, with one saying they weren’t expecting to find anyone alive but as they were digging, they saw his eyes and he said his name. In the same province, NTV also reported that a baby boy named Hamza was found alive in Antakya 140 hours after the quake. Some details of his rescue, including how he survived so long, weren’t immediately clear.\\nNot every attempt ended happily. Zeynep Kahraman, who was brought out of the rubble after a spectacular rescue that took 50 hours, died at a hospital overnight. The ISAR German team who rescued her were shocked and saddened.\\n“It is important that the family could say goodbye, that they could see each other one more time, that they could hug each other again,” a member of the rescue team told German TV news channel n-tv.\\nThe rescues came amid growing frustration over the Turkish government’s response to the earthquake, which has killed 24,617 people and injured at least 80,000 people in Turkey alone.\\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan acknowledged earlier in the week that the initial response was hampered by the extensive damage to roads and other infrastructure that made it difficult to reach some points. He also said the worst-affected area was 500 kilometers (310 miles) in diameter and was home to 13.5 million people in Turkey.\\nThat has meant rescue crews have had to pick and choose how and where to help.\\nDuring a tour of quake-damaged cities Saturday, Erdogan said a disaster of this scope was rare and again referred to it as the “disaster of the century.”\\nBut the challenges facing aid efforts were of little comfort to those waiting for help.\\nIn Antakya, the capital of Hatay province, scattered rescue crews were still hard at work but many residents had left by Saturday. Among those who stayed were people with family still buried. Many of them had been camping in the streets for days and sleeping in cars.\\nActing on a tip, a rescue team from Hong Kong found three survivors under a building near the city’s center on Saturday, said Gallant Wong, the group’s spokesperson.\\nBut Bulent Cifcifli, a local man, said he has been waiting for days for crews to pull his mother’s body from her collapsed home. He said rescuers were working to retrieve her body at one point, but they were called to another location because they suspected there were survivors.\\n“Six days later, we don’t know how many are still under the rubble, and how many are dead or alive,” Cifcifli said, blaming a lack of heavy equipment.\\nYazi al-Ali, a Syrian refugee who came to Antakya from Reyhanli, has been living in a tent as she waits for crews to find her mother, two sisters, including one who was pregnant, and their families. At one point, she stood over the rubble of the home in Antakya’s old city center where she believes her pregnant sister was buried and, in a cracking voice, shouted her sister’s name, “Rajha!”\\n“No one is answering to us, and no one comes to look,” she said. “They have stopped us from looking ourselves. I don’t know why.”\\nEven though experts say trapped people can live for a week or more, the odds of finding additional survivors are quickly waning. Rescuers were shifting to thermal cameras to help identify life amid the rubble, a sign that any remaining survivors could be too weak to call for help.\\nAs aid continued to arrive Saturday, a 99-member group from the Indian Army’s medical assistance team began treating the injured in a temporary field hospital in the southern city of Iskenderun, where a main hospital was demolished.\\nOne man, Sukru Canbulat, was wheeled into the hospital, his left leg badly injured with deep bruising, contusions and lacerations.\\nWincing in pain, he said he was rescued from his collapsed apartment building in nearby Antakya within hours of the quake.

       "  '\\nWithin hours of an Air Force F-22 downing a giant Chinese balloon that had crossed the United States, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin reached out to his Chinese counterpart via a special crisis line, aiming for a quick general-to-general talk that could explain things and ease tensions.\\nBut Austin’s effort Saturday fell flat, when Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe declined to get on the line, the Pentagon says.\\nChina’s Defense Ministry says it refused the call from Austin after the balloon was shot down because the U.S. had “not created the proper atmosphere” for dialogue and exchange. The U.S. action had “seriously violated international norms and set a pernicious precedent,” a ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement issued late Thursday.\\nIt’s been an experience that’s frustrated U.S. commanders for decades, when it comes to getting their Chinese counterparts on a phone or video line as some flaring crisis is sending tensions between the two nations climbing.\\nFrom Americans’ perspective, the lack of the kind of reliable crisis communications that helped get the U.S. and Soviet Union through the Cold War without an armed nuclear exchange is raising the dangers of the U.S.-China relationship now, at a time when China’s military strength is growing and tensions with the U.S. are on the rise.\\nWithout that ability for generals in opposing capitals to clear things up in a hurry, Americans worry that misunderstandings, false reports or accidental collisions could cause a minor confrontation to spiral into greater hostilities.\\nAnd it’s not about any technical shortfall with the communication equipment, said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of Indo-Pacific studies at the German Marshall Fund think tank. The issue is a fundamental disparity in the way China and the U.S. view the value and purpose of military-to-military hotlines.\\nU.S. military leaders’ faith in Washington-to-Beijing hotlines as a way to defuse flare-ups with China’s military has been butting up against a sharply different take — a Chinese political system that runs on slow deliberative consultation by political leaders and makes no room for individually directed, real-time talk between rival generals. And Chinese leaders are suspicious of the whole U.S. notion of a hotline. They see it as an American channel for talking their way out of blowback for a U.S. provocation.\\n“That’s really dangerous,” Assistant Secretary for Defense Ely Ratner said Thursday of the difficulty of military-to-military crisis communications with China, when Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley pressed him about China’s latest rebuff on Beijing’s and Washington’s hotline setup.\\nU.S. generals are persisting in their efforts to open more lines of communication with Chinese counterparts, the defense official said, testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “And unfortunately, to date, the PLA is not answering that call,” Ratner said, referring to China’s People’s Liberation Army.\\nRatner accused China of using vital channels of communication simply as a blunter messaging tool, shutting them down or opening them up again to underscore China’s displeasure or pleasure. In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning referred questions about Wei’s refusal to take Austin’s call to the Defense Ministry,\\nChina’s resistance to military hotlines as tensions increase puts more urgency on efforts by President Joe Biden and his top civilian diplomats and security aides to build up their own communication channels with President Xi Jinping and other top Chinese political officials, for situations where military hotlines may go unanswered, U.S. officials and China experts say.\\nBoth U.S. and Chinese militaries are building up for a possible confrontation over U.S.-backed self-ruled Taiwan, which China claims as its territory. The next flare-up seems only a matter of time. It could happen with an expected event, such as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s promised visit to Taiwan, or something unexpected, like the 2001 collision between a Chinese fighter and a U.S. Navy EP-3 reconnaissance plane over the South China Sea. Without commanders talking in real-time, Americans and Chinese would have one less way of averting greater conflict..\\n“My worry is that the EP-3 type incident will happen again,” said Lyle Morris, a country director for China for the Office of the Secretary of Defense from 2019 to 2021, now a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “And we will be in much different political environments of hostility and mistrust, where that could go wrong in a hurry.”\\nBiden has emphasized building lines of communications with China to “responsibly manage” their differences. A November meeting between Xi and Biden yielded an announcement the two governments would resume a range of dialogues that China had shut down after an August Taiwan visit by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\\nLast weekend, the U.S. canceled what would have been a relationship-building visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken after the transit of the Chinese balloon, which the U.S. says was for espionage. China claims it was a civilian balloon used for meteorological research.\\nThe same week that Chinas balloon flew over the U.S., Austin was in the Philippines to announce an expanded U.S. military footprint there, neighboring China, noted Tiehlin Yen, director of the Taiwan Center for Security Studies, a think tank. “America is also very nationalistic these days,” Yen said.\\n“From a regional security perspective, this dialogue is necessary,” Yen said.\\nWhat passes for military and civilian hotlines between China and the U.S. aren’t the classic red phones on a desk.\\nUnder a 2008 agreement, the China-U.S. military hotline amounts to a multistep process by which one capital relays a request to the other for a joint call or videoconference between top officials on encrypted lines. The pact gives the other side 48 hours and up to respond, although nothing in the pact stops top officials from talking immediately.\\nSometimes when the U.S. calls, current and former U.S. officials say, Chinese officials don’t even pick up.\\n“No one answered. It just rang,” recounted Kristen Gunness, a senior policy analyst at the Rand Corporation. Gunness was speaking about a March 2009 incident when she was working as an adviser to the Pentagon’s chief of naval operations. Chinese navy vessels at the time surrounded a U.S. surveillance ship in the South China Sea and demanded the American leave. U.S. and Chinese military officials eventually talked - but some 24 hours later.\\nIt took decades of Washington pushing to get Beijing to agree to the current system of military crisis communications, said David Sedney, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who negotiated it.\\n“And then once we had it in place, it was clear that they were very reluctant to use it in any substantive purpose,” Sedney said.\\nAmericans’ test calls on the hotline would get picked up, he said. And when Americans called to give congratulations on some Chinese holiday, Chinese officials would pick up and say thanks, he said.\\nAnything more sensitive, Sedney said, the staffers answering the phone “would say, ‘We’ll check. As soon as our leadership is ready to talk, we’ll get back to you.’ Nothing would happen.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nRescue workers made a final push Thursday to find survivors of the earthquake in Turkey and Syria that rendered many communities unrecognizable to their inhabitants and led the Turkish president to declare it “the disaster of the century.” The death toll topped 20,000.\\nThe earthquake affected an area that is home to 13.5 million people in Turkey and an unknown number in Syria and stretches farther than the distance from London to Paris or Boston to Philadelphia. Even with an army of people taking part in the rescue effort, crews had to pick and choose where to help.\\nThe scene from the air showed the scope of devastation, with entire neighborhoods of high-rises reduced to twisted metal, pulverized concrete and exposed wires.\\nIn Adiyaman, Associated Press journalists saw someone plead with rescuers to look through the rubble of a building where relatives were trapped. They refused, saying no one was alive there and that they had to prioritize areas with possible survivors.\\nA man who gave his name only as Ahmet out of fear of government retribution later asked the AP: “How can I go home and sleep? My brother is there. He may still be alive.”\\nThe death toll from Monday’s 7.8 magnitude catastrophe rose to nearly 21,000, eclipsing the more than 18,400 who died in the 2011 earthquake off Fukushima, Japan, that triggered a tsunami and the estimated 18,000 people who died in a temblor near the Turkish capital, Istanbul, in 1999.\\nThe new figure, which is certain to rise, included over 17,600 people in Turkey and more than 3,300 in civil war-torn Syria. Tens of thousands were also injured.\\nEven though experts say people could survive for a week or more, the chances of finding survivors in the freezing temperatures were dimming. As emergency crews and panicked relatives dug through the rubble — and occasionally found people alive — the focus began to shift to demolishing dangerously unstable structures.\\nThe DHA news agency broadcast the rescue of a 10-year-old in Antakya. The agency said medics had to amputate an arm to free her and that her parents and three siblings had died. A 17-year-old girl emerged alive in Adıyaman, and a 20-year-old was found in Kahramanmaras by rescuers who shouted “God is great.”\\nIn Nurdagi, a city of around 40,000 nestled between snowy mountains some 35 miles (56 kilometers) from the quake’s epicenter, vast swaths of the city were leveled, with scarcely a building unaffected. Even those that did not collapse were heavily damaged, making them unsafe.\\nThrongs of onlookers, mostly family members of people trapped inside, watched as heavy machines ripped at one building that had collapsed, its floors pancaked together with little more than a few inches in between.\\nMehmet Yilmaz, 67, watched from a distance as bulldozers and other demolition equipment began to bring down what remained of the building where six of his family members had been trapped, including four children.\\nHe estimated that about 80 people were still beneath the rubble and doubted that anyone would be found alive.\\n“There’s no hope. We can’t give up our hope in God, but they entered the building with listening devices and dogs, and there was nothing,” Yilmaz said.\\nMehmet Nasir Dusan, 67, sat watching as the remnants of the nine-story building were brought down in billowing clouds of dust. He said he held no hope of reuniting with his five family members trapped under the debris.\\nStill, he said, recovering their bodies would bring some small comfort.\\n“We’re not leaving this site until we can recover their bodies, even if it takes 10 days,” Dusan said. “My family is destroyed now.”\\nIn Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the epicenter, a sports hall the size of a basketball court served as a makeshift morgue to accommodate and identify bodies.\\nOn the floor lay dozens of bodies wrapped in blankets or black shrouds. At least one appeared to be that of a 5- or 6-year-old.\\nAt the entrance, a man wept over a black body bag that lay next to another in the bed of a small truck. “I’m 70 years old. God should have taken me, not my son,” he cried.\\nWorkers continued to conduct rescue operations in Kahramanmaras, but it was clear that many who were trapped in collapsed buildings had already died. One rescue worker was heard saying that his psychological state was declining and that the smell of death was becoming too much to bear.\\nIn northwestern Syria, the first U.N. aid trucks since the quake to enter the rebel-controlled area from Turkey arrived, underscoring the difficulty of getting help to people there. In the Turkish city of Antakya, dozens scrambled for aid in front of a truck distributing children’s coats and other supplies.\\nOne survivor, Ahmet Tokgoz, called for the government to evacuate people from the region. Many of those who have lost their homes found shelter in tents, stadiums and other temporary accommodation, but others have slept outdoors.\\n“Especially in this cold, it is not possible to live here,” he said. “If people haven’t died from being stuck under the rubble, they’ll die from the cold.”\\nThe winter weather and damage to roads and airports have hampered the response. Some in Turkey have complained that the government was slow to respond — a perception that could hurt Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a time when he faces a tough battle for reelection in May.\\n“As you know, the earthquake hit an area of 500-kilometer (311-mile) diameter where 13.5 million of our people live, and that made our job difficult,” Erdogan said Thursday.\\nIn the Turkish town of Elbistan, rescuers stood atop the rubble from a collapsed home and pulled out an elderly woman.\\nRescue teams urged quiet in the hopes of hearing stifled pleas for help, and the Syrian paramedic group known as the White Helmets noted that “every second could mean saving a life.”\\nBut more and more often, the teams pulled out dead bodies. In Antakya, more than 100 bodies were awaiting identification in a makeshift morgue outside a hospital.\\nWith the chances of finding people alive dwindling, crews in some places began demolishing buildings. Authorities called off search-and-rescue operations in the cities of Kilis and Sanliurfa, where destruction was not as severe as in other areas. Vice President Fuat Oktay said rescue work was mostly complete in Diyarbakir, Adana and Osmaniye.\\nAcross the border in Syria, assistance trickled in. The U.N. is authorized to deliver aid through only one border crossing, and road damage has prevented that thus far. U.N. officials pleaded for humanitarian concerns to take precedence over wartime politics.\\nIt wasn’t clear how many people were still unaccounted for in both countries.\\nTurkey’s disaster-management agency said more than 110,000 rescue personnel were now taking part in the effort and more than 5,500 vehicles, including tractors, cranes, bulldozers and excavators had been shipped. The Foreign Ministry said 95 countries have offered help.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sought Western support for his country in surprise visits to Britain and France on Wednesday, pushing for fighter jets to battle Russian invaders in a dramatic speech to the U.K. Parliament, and then flying to Paris to meet the French and German leaders over dinner at the Elysee Palace.\\nZelenskyy’s European tour and pleas for more advanced weapons came as Ukraine braces for an expected Russian offensive and hatches its own plans to retake land held by Moscow’s forces. Western support has been key to Kyiv’s surprisingly stiff defense, and the two sides are engaged in grinding battles.\\nZelenskyy thanked the British people for their support since “Day One” of Moscow’s invasion nearly a year ago, as Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said fighter jets were “part of the conversation” about aid to Ukraine.\\n“Nothing is off the table,” he said at an evening news conference at a British army base. “We must arm Ukraine in the short term, but we must bolster Ukraine for the long term.”\\nZelenskyy said Ukraine needs all kinds of supplies, not just planes, but also ammunition and long-range missiles\\n“Without this, there would be stagnation which will not bring to anything good,” he said, calling his visit to Britain “very fruitful.”\\nThen it was off to Paris for dinner with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.\\nZelenskyy was greeted Wednesday night on the steps of the Elysee Palace with a friendly embrace by Macron, and then all three leaders headed inside. The visit marks a turnaround in Zelenskyy’s relations toward France and Germany, which earlier in the war were viewed by many in Ukraine as not doing enough to help.\\n“Ukraine can count on France, its European partners and allies to win the war. Russia cannot and must not win,” Macron said before their working dinner. Macron’s office put out a statement confirming that Zelenskyy would attend Thursday’s summit in Brussels, where EU leaders will pledge their support for the Ukrainian people.\\nZelenskyy’s travel to European capitals on Wednesday was just his second foreign trip since Russia invaded on Feb, 24, 2022. In December, he traveled to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden and address the U.S. Congress.\\nHis day began when he arrived on a Royal Air Force plane in London and was greeted on the tarmac with an embrace from Sunak. They held talks at the prime minister’s 10 Downing St. residence before Zelenskyy’s speech to lawmakers in the 900-year-old Westminster Hall, the oldest — and, on a cold winter day, unheated — part of Parliament.\\n“London has stood with Kyiv since Day One,” he said, repeatedly thanking Britons for their aid. The U.K. has sent Ukraine more than 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in weapons and equipment,\\nWearing his trademark olive drab sweatshirt, he urged allies to deliver jets to Ukraine, saying combat aircraft would be “wings for freedom.”\\nIn a dramatic gesture, Zelenskyy presented the speaker of the House of Commons with a Ukrainian air force helmet, inscribed by a Ukrainian pilot: “We have freedom. Give us wings to protect it.”\\nThe president was trying to soften allies’ reluctance to send advanced fighter jets, both because they are complex to fly and for fear of escalating the war.\\nThe U.K. has repeatedly said it’s not practical to provide Ukraine with British warplanes. But in a shift, the government said Wednesday it was “actively looking” at whether Ukraine could be sent Western jets, and was “in discussion with our allies” about it.\\nBritain also said it would train Ukrainian pilots in Britain on “NATO-standard fighter jets” within weeks.\\nSunak spokesman Max Blain said the government was exploring “what jets we may be able to give” over the coming years, but had not made a decision on whether to send its F-35 or Typhoons.\\n“We think it is right to provide both short-term equipment … that can help win the war now, but also look to the medium to long term to make sure Ukraine has every possible capacity it requires,” he said.\\nUkraine has sought Western fighter jets since early in the war to bolster its force of Soviet-made MiG-29 and Su fighters. The success of its air force in defending its skies and territory despite Russia’s bigger numbers helped push back Moscow’s initial assault.\\nThe Russian Embassy in London strongly warned the U.K. against supplying the warplanes, saying Britain would bear responsibility “for another twist of escalation and the ensuing military-political consequences for the European continent and the entire world.”\\nMacron has said France hasn’t ruled out sending fighter jets but set conditions, including not leading to an escalation of tensions or using the aircraft “to touch Russian soil,” and not resulting in weakening “the capacities of the French army.”\\nSunak and Zelenskyy flew by helicopter to Lulworth Camp, a base in southwest England, where they met Ukrainian troops being trained on the Challenger 2 tanks the U.K. is sending as part of the hundreds that Kyiv says it needs. More than 10,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained in the U.K., and Britain says it will train 20,000 more in 2023.\\n“I am proud that today we will expand that training from soldiers to marines and fighter jet pilots, ensuring Ukraine has a military able to defend its interests well into the future,” Sunak said.\\nZelenskyy also went to Buckingham Palace, where he met with King Charles III, who greeted him with a broad smile and a warm handshake before they had tea. The king told the president that “we’ve all been worried about you and thinking about your country for so long.”\\nIn his Parliament speech, Zelenskyy noted that Charles was a qualified military pilot.\\n“The king is an air force pilot,” Zekenskyy said, and “in Ukraine today, every air force pilot is a king.”\\nZelenskyy was greeted with applause, cheers and cries of “Slava Ukraini” — “Glory to Ukraine” — as he arrived in Parliament, where his cause has wide support.\\nHe had addressed the U.K. Parliament remotely in March, two weeks after the start of the invasion. He echoed World War II leader Winston Churchill’s famous “never surrender” speech, vowing that Ukrainians “will fight till the end at sea, in the air. We will continue fighting for our land, whatever the cost.”\\nOn Wednesday, he recalled how on a prewar visit to London, he sat in Churchill’s chair in his subterranean wartime headquarters, and had a feeling that only now he understands: “It was the feeling of how bravery takes you through the most unimaginable hardships to finally reward you with victory.”\\nIn past wars, “evil lost,” he told U.K. lawmakers. “We know Russia will lose and we we know victory will change the world.″\\nHe also urged stronger sanctions against Moscow until “Russia is deprived of any possibility to finance this war.”\\nCoinciding with the visit, the U.K. government announced new sanctions against six entities that Britain said supplied equipment to the Russian military. CST, a manufacturer of Russian drones and parts for helicopters used against Ukraine, were among them.\\nThe London visit came as Russian forces shelled areas of eastern Ukraine in what Kyiv authorities believe is part of a thrust by the Kremlin’s forces before the invasion anniversary. Moscow, meanwhile, believes Ukraine is preparing its own battlefield push.\\n',\n",

The earthquake also destroyed the runway at Hatay’s airport, further disrupting the response.\\n“It is not possible to be prepared for such a disaster,” Erdogan said. “We will not leave any of our citizens uncared for.” He also hit back at critics, saying “dishonorable people” were spreading “lies and slander” about the government’s actions.\\nTeams from more than two dozen countries have joined tens of thousands of local emergency personnel in the effort. But the scale of destruction from the quake and its powerful aftershocks was so immense and spread over such a wide area that many people were still awaiting help.\\nExperts said the survival window for those trapped under the rubble or otherwise unable to obtain basic necessities was closing rapidly. At the same time, they said it was too soon to abandon hope.\\n“The first 72 hours are considered to be critical,” said Steven Godby, a natural hazards expert at Nottingham Trent University in England. “The survival ratio on average within 24 hours is 74%, after 72 hours it is 22% and by the fifth day it is 6%.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nUS President Joe Biden called on Republicans in his State of the Union address Tuesday night to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the nation as he sought to overcome pessimism in the country and navigate political divisions in Washington.\\nThe backdrop of the annual address was markedly different from the previous two years, with a Republican speaker sitting behind Biden and GOP lawmakers in the audience preparing to scrutinize both his administration and his policies. He sought to reassure the nation that his stewardship of the country has delivered results both at home and abroad, as he also set out to prove his fitness for a likely re-election bid.\\nThe challenges for Biden are many: economic uncertainty, a wearying war in Ukraine, growing tensions with China and more. And signs of the past trauma at the Capitol, most notably the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the Capitol, were unavoidable, with a large fence encircling the complex as lawmakers and those in attendance faced tighter-than-usual security measures.\\nRather than rolling out flashy policy proposals, the president set out to offer a reassuring assessment of the nation’s condition, declaring that two years after the Capitol attack, America’s democracy was “unbowed and unbroken.”\\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience,” he said, highlighting record job creation during his tenure as the country has emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nBiden also pointed to areas of bipartisan progress in his first two years in office, including on states’ vital infrastructure and high tech manufacturing. And he says, “There is no reason we can’t work together in this new Congress.”\\n“The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere,” Biden said. “And that’s always been my vision for the country: to restore the soul of the nation, to rebuild the backbone of America — the middle class — to unite the country.”\\n“We’ve been sent here to finish the job!”\\nThe president took to the House rostrum at a time when just a quarter of U.S. adults say things in the country are headed in the right direction, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. About three-quarters say things are on the wrong track. And a majority of Democrats don’t want Biden to seek another term.\\nHe sought to confront those sentiments head-on.\\n“You wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away, I get it,” Biden said. “That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years.”\\nRepublican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who was seated behind Biden urged his conference to be respectful ahead of Biden’s address and in turn asked Biden to refrain from using the phrase “extreme MAGA Republicans,” which the president deployed on the campaign trail in 2022.\\n“I won’t tear up the speech, I won’t play games,” McCarthy told reporters, a reference to Pelosi’s dramatic action after President Donald Trump’s final State of the Union address.\\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who gained a national profile as Trump’s press secretary, was to deliver the Republican response to Biden’s speech.\\nShe was to focus much of her remarks on social issues, including race in business and education and alleged big-tech censorship of conservatives.\\n“While you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,” she was to say, according to excerpts released by her office. “Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.”\\nWith COVID-19 restrictions now lifted, the White House and legislators from both parties invited guests designed to drive home political messages with their presence in the House chamber. The parents of Tyre Nichols, who was severely beaten by police officers in Memphis and later died, are among those seated with first lady Jill Biden. Other Biden guests included the rock star/humanitarian Bono and the 26-year-old who disarmed a gunman in last month’s Monterey Park, California, shooting.\\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus invited family members of those involved in police incidents, as they sought to press for action on police reform in the wake of Nichols’ death. The White House, ahead of the speech, paired police reform with bringing down violence, suggesting that giving police better training tools could lead to less crime nationwide.\\nBiden was shifting his sights after spending his first two years pushing through major bills such as the bipartisan infrastructure package, legislation to promote high-tech manufacturing and climate measures. With Republicans now in control of the House, he is turning his focus to implementing those massive laws and making sure voters credit him for the improvements.\\nThe switch is largely by necessity. The newly empowered GOP is itching to undo many of his achievements and vowing to pursue a multitude of investigations — including looking into the recent discoveries of classified documents from his time as vice president at his home and former office.\\nAt the same time, Biden will need to find a way to work across the aisle to keep the government funded by raising the federal debt limit by this summer. He has insisted that he won’t negotiate on meeting the country’s debt obligations; Republicans have been equally adamant that he must make spending concessions.\\nOn the eve of the president’s address, McCarthy challenged Biden to come to the negotiating table with House Republicans to slash spending as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling.\\n“We must move towards a balanced budget and insist on genuine accountability for every dollar we spend,” McCarthy said.\\nWhile hopes for large-scale bipartisanship are slim, Biden reissued his 2022 appeal for Congress to get behind his “unity agenda” of actions to address the opioid epidemic, mental health, veterans’ health and cancer. He announced new executive action and call for lawmakers to act to support new measures to support cancer research, address housing needs and suicide among veterans, boost access to mental health care, and move to further crack down on deadly trafficking in fentanyl.\\nThe president also called for extending the new $35 per month price cap on insulin for people on Medicare to everyone in the country. And he pushed Congress to quadruple the 1% tax on corporate share buybacks that was enacted in the Democrats’ climate and health care bill passed last year known as the Inflation Reduction Act.\\nThe speech comes days after Biden ordered the military to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon that flew brazenly across the country, captivating the nation and serving as a reminder of tense relations between the two global powers.\\nLast year’s address occurred just days after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine and as many in the West doubted Kyiv’s ability to withstand the onslaught. Over the past year, the U.S. and other allies have sent tens of billions of dollars in military and economic assistance to bolster Ukraine’s defenses. Now, Biden must make the case — both at home and abroad — for sustaining that coalition as the war drags on.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nRepublican lawmakers on Sunday accused China of deliberately surveilling sensitive U.S. military sites with a suspected spy balloon and said the Biden administration had given Beijing an intelligence opening by not downing the balloon during its high-altitude drift through American airspace.\\nThe balloon’s presence in the sky above the United States before a military jet shot it down over the Atlantic Ocean with a missile Saturday further strained U.S.-China ties. America’s top diplomat abruptly scrapped a trip to Beijing and China’s defense ministry said in a statement after the balloon fell into the waters off the Carolina coast that it “reserves the right to take necessary measures to deal with similar situations.”\\n“Clearly this was an attempt by China to gather information, to defeat our command and control of our sensitive missile defense and nuclear weapon sites,” said the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, among the members of Congress on the Sunday news shows. “And that certainly is an urgency that this administration does not recognize.”\\nU.S. defense and military officials said the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said President Joe Biden was first briefed on it.\\nState of the Union: Biden sees economic glow, GOP sees gloom\\r\\n“It defies belief to suggest there was nowhere” between Alaska and the Carolinas where the U.S. could have safely shot down the balloon, said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.\\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the full Senate will get a briefing next week on the balloon, including details about its surveillance capabilities, and that the administration is considering measures against the Chinese for “their brazen activities.” He said the GOP criticism was political and premature, and that the U.S. had “sent a clear message to China that this is not acceptable.”\\nA senior administration official said other Chinese balloons transited the U.S. at least briefly on three different occasions during the Trump administration and once previously since Biden took office. The official said that the Trump balloon transits only became known after Trump left office and that intelligence agencies would offer briefings to former officials from the last administration on China’s global surveillance programs.\\nBiden issued the shootdown order but had wanted it to happen earlier, on Wednesday. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing down the balloon over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.\\n“The message they (the Chinese) were trying to send is what they believe internally, and that is that the United States is a once great superpower that’s hollowed out, that’s in decline,” said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. “And the message they’re trying to send the world is, ‘Look, these guys can’t even do anything about a balloon flying over U.S. airspace. How can you possibly count on them if something were to happen in the Indo-Pacific region?’”\\nBy Wednesday the balloon was over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.\\nThe Chinese “didn’t go and look at the Grand Canyon,” Turner said. “They went and looked at our nuclear weapon sites and the missile defense sites throughout the country.”\\nOn Thursday the Pentagon publicly exposed the balloon, and after that, “China maneuvered the balloon to leave the U.S.,” Schumer told reporters Sunday. A U.S. official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity confirmed that the balloon changed course at that point.\\nThat it could be maneuvered ran counter to China’s contention that the balloon — claimed to be a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research — had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds.\\n“This was not an accident. This was deliberate. It was intelligence, you know?″ said retired Adm. Mike Mullen, a former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman.\\nAsked whether elements of the Chinese military may have wanted to disrupt Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s planned visit, Mullen responded: “Clearly, I think that’s the case.”\\nHe said “this really damages a relationship between us and China” and “puts a big dent in moving forward in a constructive way, which we really need to do.”\\nTo Rep. Mike Gallagher, R-Wis., who leads a new House committee on China, the message conveyed by Beijing is “look what we can do to you and get away with. Your corporations, your career politicians, they will come crawling back.”\\nThe flight came to an end at about 2:39 p.m. EST Saturday, when an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, defense officials said.\\nThe debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly 7 miles. Officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks.\\nA U.S. official said those involved in the recovery were planning to take the remnants of the downed balloon to the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia, for further analysis. The official wasn’t authorized to discuss the plan by name and requested anonymity.\\nDefense officials who briefed reporters have said the U.S. was able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the country. They said the military concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along.\\nThe Pentagon has said a second balloon had been flying over Latin America. On Sunday, Colombia’s Air Force said in a statement that an object matching the characteristics of the Chinese balloon entered the country’s airspace, at a height of around 55,000 feet, on Friday morning. The Air Force said it monitored the object’s flight path until it left the country and at no time did it pose a national security risk.\\nIn neighboring Venezuela, people on social media reported seeing a balloon, but the government did not confirm its presence. In a statement, however, President Nicolas Maduro’s government condemned the U.S. for downing the balloon that had crossed the states, saying such actions against what China has said is a civilian aircraft that flew off course was an affront to international norms.\\nTurner was on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” Rubio was on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” Mullen was on ABC and Gallagher appeared on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nGen. Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a bloodless coup and later led a reluctant Pakistan into aiding the U.S. war in Afghanistan against the Taliban, has died, officials said Sunday. He was 79.\\nMusharraf, a former special forces commando, became president through the last of a string of military coups that roiled Pakistan since its founding amid the bloody 1947 partition of India. He ruled the nuclear-armed state after his 1999 coup through tensions with India, an atomic proliferation scandal and an Islamic extremist insurgency. He stepped down in 2008 while facing possible impeachment.\\nLater in life, Musharraf lived in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid criminal charges, despite attempting a political comeback in 2012. But it wasn’t to be as his poor health plagued his last years. He maintained a soldier’s fatalism after avoiding a violent death that always seemed to be stalking him as Islamic militants twice targeted him for assassination.\\n“I have confronted death and defied it several times in the past because destiny and fate have always smiled on me,” Musharraf once wrote. “I only pray that I have more than the proverbial nine lives of a cat.”\\nMusharraf’s family announced in June 2022 that he had been hospitalized for weeks in Dubai while suffering from amyloidosis, an incurable condition that sees proteins build up in the body’s organs.\\n“Going through a difficult stage where recovery is not possible and organs are malfunctioning,” the family said. They later said he also needed access to the drug daratumumab, which is used to treat multiple myeloma. That bone marrow cancer can cause amyloidosis.\\nShazia Siraj, a spokeswoman for the Pakistani Consulate in Dubai, confirmed his death and said diplomats were providing support to his family. The Pakistani military also offered its condolences.\\n“May Allah bless the departed soul and give strength to bereaved family,” a military statement said.\\nPakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif similarly offered his condolences in a short statement.\\n“May God give his family the courage to bear this loss,” Sharif said.\\nPakistan, a nation nearly twice the size of California along the Arabian Sea, is now home to 220 million people. But it would be its border with Afghanistan that would soon draw the U.S.′s attention and dominate Musharraf’s life a little under two years after he seized power.\\nAl-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden launched the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks from Afghanistan, sheltered by the country’s Taliban rulers. Musharraf knew what would come next.\\n“America was sure to react violently, like a wounded bear,” he wrote in his autobiography. “If the perpetrator turned out to be al-Qaida, then that wounded bear would come charging straight toward us.”\\nBy Sept. 12, then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell told Musharraf that Pakistan would either be “with us or against us.” Musharraf said another American official threatened to bomb Pakistan ”back into the Stone Age” if it chose the latter.\\nMusharraf chose the former. A month later, he stood by then-President George W. Bush at the Waldorf Astoria in New York to declare Pakistan’s unwavering support to fight with the United States against “terrorism in all its forms wherever it exists.”\\nPakistan became a crucial transit point for NATO supplies headed to landlocked Afghanistan. That was the case even though Pakistan’s powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency had backed the Taliban after it swept into power in Afghanistan in 1994. Prior to that, the CIA and others funneled money and arms through the ISI to Islamic fighters battling the 1980s Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.\\nThe U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan saw Taliban fighters flee over the border back into Pakistan, including bin Laden, whom the U.S. would kill in 2011 at a compound in Abbottabad. They regrouped and the offshoot Pakistani Taliban emerged, beginning a yearslong insurgency in the mountainous border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\nThe CIA began flying armed Predator drones from Pakistan with Musharraf’s blessing, using an airstrip built by the founding president of the United Arab Emirates for falconing in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. The program helped beat back the militants but saw over 400 strikes in Pakistan alone kill at least 2,366 people — including 245 civilians, according to the Washington-based New America Foundation think tank.\\nThough Pakistan under Musharraf launched these operations, the militants still thrived as billions of American dollars flowed into the nation. That led to suspicion that still plagues the U.S. relationship with Pakistan.\\n“After 9/11, then President Musharraf made a strategic shift to abandon the Taliban and support the U.S. in the war on terror, but neither side believes the other has lived up to expectations flowing from that decision,” a 2009 U.S. cable from then-Ambassador Anne Patterson published by WikiLeaks said, describing what had become the diplomatic equivalent of a loveless marriage.\\n“The relationship is one of co-dependency we grudgingly admit — Pakistan knows the U.S. cannot afford to walk away; the U.S. knows Pakistan cannot survive without our support.”\\nBut it would be Musharraf’s life on the line. Militants tried to assassinate him twice in 2003 by targeting his convoy, first with a bomb planted on a bridge and then with car bombs. That second attack saw Musharraf’s vehicle lifted into the air by the blast before touching the ground again. It raced to safety on just its rims, Musharraf pulling a Glock pistol in case he needed to fight his way out.\\nIt wasn’t until his wife, Sehba, saw the car covered in gore that the scale of the attack dawned on him.\\n“She is always calm in the face of danger,” he recounted. But then, “she was screaming uncontrollably, hysterically.”\\nBorn Aug. 11, 1943, in New Delhi, India, Musharraf was the middle son of a diplomat. His family joined millions of other Muslims in fleeing westward when predominantly Hindu India and Islamic Pakistan split during independence from Britain in 1947. The partition saw hundreds of thousands of people killed in riots and fighting.\\nMusharraf entered the Pakistani army at age 18 and made his career there as Islamabad fought three wars against India. He’d launch his own attempt at seizing territory in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir in 1999 just before seizing power from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\\nSharif had ordered Musharraf’s dismissal as the army chief flew home from a visit to Sri Lanka and denied his plane landing rights in Pakistan, even as it ran low on fuel. On the ground, the army seized control and after he landed Musharraf took charge.\\nYet as ruler, Musharraf nearly reached a deal with India on Kashmir, according to U.S. diplomats at the time. He also worked toward a rapprochement with Pakistan’s longtime rival.\\nAnother major scandal emerged under his rule when the world discovered that famed Pakistani nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, long associated with the country’s atomic bomb, had been selling centrifuge designs and other secrets to countries including Iran, Libya and North Korea, making tens of millions of dollars. Those designs helped Pyongyang to arm itself with a nuclear weapon, while centrifuges from Khan’s designs still spin in Iran amid the collapse of Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers.\\nMusharraf said he suspected Khan but it wasn’t until 2003 when then-CIA director George Tenet showed him detailed plans for a Pakistani centrifuge that the scientist had been selling that he realized the severity of what happened.\\nKhan would confess on state television in 2004 and Musharraf would pardon him, though he’d be confined to house arrest after that.\\n“For years, A.Q.’s lavish lifestyle and tales of his wealth, properties, corrupt practices and financial magnanimity at state expense were generally all too well known in Islamabad’s social and government circles,” Musharraf later wrote. “However, these were largely ignored. ... In hindsight that neglect was apparently a serious mistake.”\\nMusharraf’s domestic support eventually eroded. He held flawed elections in late 2002 — only after changing the constitution to give himself sweeping powers to sack the prime minister and parliament. He then reneged on a promise to stand down as army chief by the end of 2004.\\nMilitant anger toward Musharraf increased in 2007 when he ordered a raid against the Red Mosque in downtown Islamabad. It had become a sanctuary for militants opposed to Pakistan’s support of the Afghan war. The weeklong operation killed over 100 people.\\nThe incident severely damaged Musharraf’s reputation among everyday citizens and earned him the undying hatred of militants who launched a series of punishing attacks following the raid.\\nFearing the judiciary would block his continued rule, Musharraf fired the chief justice of Pakistan’s Supreme Court. That triggered mass demonstrations.\\nUnder pressure at home and abroad to restore civilian rule, Musharraf stepped down as army chief. Though he won another five-year presidential term, Musharraf faced a major crisis following former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto’s assassination in December 2007 at a campaign rally as she sought to become prime minister for the third time.\\nThe public suspected Musharraf’s hand in the killing, which he denied. A later United Nations report acknowledged the Pakistani Taliban was a main suspect in her slaying but warned that elements of Pakistan’s intelligence services may have been involved.\\nMusharraf resigned as president in August 2008 after ruling coalition officials threatened to have him impeached for imposing emergency rule and firing judges.\\n“I hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes,” Musharraf, struggling with his emotions, said in an hourlong televised address.\\nAfterward, he lived abroad in Dubai and London, attempting a political comeback in 2012. But Pakistan instead arrested the former general and put him under house arrest. He faced treason allegations over the Supreme Court debacle and other charges stemming from the Red Mosque raid and Bhutto’s assassination.\\nThe image of Musharraf being treated as a criminal suspect shocked Pakistan, where military generals long have been considered above the law. Pakistan allowed him to leave the country on bail to Dubai in 2016 for medical treatment and he remained there after facing a later-overturned death sentence.\\nBut it suggested Pakistan may be ready to turn a corner in its history of military rule.\\n“Musharraf’s resignation is a sad yet familiar story of hubris, this time in a soldier who never became a good politician,” wrote Patterson, the U.S. ambassador, at the time.\\n“The good news is that the demonstrated strength of institutions that brought Musharraf down — the media, free elections and civil society — also provide some hope for Pakistan’s future. It was these institutions that ironically became much stronger under his government.”\\n',\n",

China insisted the flyover was an accident involving a civilian aircraft and threatened repercussions.\\nUS President Joe Biden issued the order but had wanted the balloon downed even earlier, on Wednesday. He was advised that the best time for the operation would be when it was over water, U.S. officials said. Military officials determined that bringing it down over land from an altitude of 60,000 feet would pose an undue risk to people on the ground.\\nChina responded that it reserved the right to “take further actions” and criticized the U.S. for “an obvious overreaction and a serious violation of international practice.”\\nIn its statement Sunday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that “China will resolutely uphold the relevant company’s legitimate rights and interests, and at the same time reserving the right to take further actions in response.”\\nThe presence of the balloon in the skies above the U.S. this week dealt a severe blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years. It prompted Secretary of State Antony Blinken to abruptly cancel a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing tensions.\\nJOE BIDEN\\r\\nState of the Union: Biden sees economic glow, GOP sees gloom\\r\\nBiden makes progress on 'unity agenda' outlined in 2022\\r\\nBiden sounds ready to seek 2nd term while rallying Democrats\\r\\nBiden, Cabinet visiting 20 states after State of the Union\\r\\n“They successfully took it down and I want to compliment our aviators who did it,” Biden said after getting off Air Force One en route to Camp David.\\nThe giant white orb was spotted Saturday morning over the Carolinas as it approached the Atlantic coast. About 2:39 p.m. EST, an F-22 fighter jet fired a missile at the balloon, puncturing it while it was about 6 nautical miles off the coast near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, senior defense officials said.\\nThe spectacle had Americans looking to the skies all week, wondering whether the mysterious balloon had floated over them.\\nOn Saturday, Ashlyn Preaux, 33, went out to get her mail in Forestbrook, South Carolina, and noticed her neighbors looking up — and there it was, the balloon in the cloudless blue sky. Then she saw fighter jets circling and the balloon get hit.\\n“I did not anticipate waking up to be in a ‘Top Gun’ movie today,” she said.\\nThe debris landed in 47 feet of water, shallower than officials had expected, and it spread out over roughly seven miles and the recovery operation included several ships. The officials estimated the recovery efforts would be completed in a short time, not weeks. A salvage vessel was en route.\\nU.S. defense and military officials said Saturday that the balloon entered the U.S. air defense zone north of the Aleutian Islands on Jan. 28 and moved largely over land across Alaska and then into Canadian airspace in the Northwest Territories on Monday. It crossed back into U.S. territory over northern Idaho on Tuesday, the day the White House said Biden was first briefed on it.\\nThe balloon was spotted Thursday over Montana, home to Malmstrom Air Force Base, which has fields of nuclear missile silos.\\nThe Americans were able to collect intelligence on the balloon as it flew over the U.S., giving them a number of days to analyze it and learn how it moved and what it was capable of surveilling, according to two senior defense officials said. The officials briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.\\nThe officials said the U.S. military was constantly assessing the threat, and concluded that the technology on the balloon didn’t give the Chinese significant intelligence beyond what it could already obtain from satellites, though the U.S. took steps to mitigate what information it could gather as it moved along.\\nRepublicans were critical of Biden’s response.\\n“Allowing a spy balloon from the Communist Party of China to travel across the entire continental United States before contesting its presence is a disastrous projection of weakness by the White House,” said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\\nSen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., tweeted: “Now that this embarrassing episode is over, we need answers from the Biden Administration on the decision-making process. Communist China was allowed to violate American sovereignty unimpeded for days. We must be better prepared for future provocations and incursions by the CCP.”\\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., was more positive: “Thank you to the men and women of the United States military who were responsible for completing the mission to shoot down the Chinese surveillance balloon. The Biden Administration did the right thing in bringing it down.”\\nChina has claimed that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had been blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China’s contention that it was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.\\nThe Chinese government on Saturday sought to play down the cancellation of Blinken’s trip. “In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit, the U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that,” China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.\\nThe Pentagon also acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. “We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement. Officials said the balloons are part of a fleet that China uses for surveillance, and they can be maneuvered remotely through small motors and propellers. One official said they carry equipment in the pod under the balloon that is not usually associated with standard meteorological activities or civilian research.\\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a question about the second balloon.\\nThis isn’t the first time Chinese spy balloons have crossed into U.S. airspace in recent years, one of the officials said. At least three times during the Trump administration and at least one other time during Biden’s time as president they’ve seen balloons cross, but not for this long, the official said.\\nBlinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China’s) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”\\nUncensored reactions on the Chinese internet mirrored the official government stance that the U.S. was hyping the situation. Some used it as a chance to poke fun at U.S. defenses, saying it couldn’t even defend against a balloon, and nationalist influencers leaped to use the news to mock the U.S.\\nChina has denied any claims of spying and said it is a civilian-use balloon intended for meteorology research. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasized that the balloon’s journey was out of its control and urged the U.S. not to “smear” it because of the balloon.\\nIn preparation for the operation Saturday, the Federal Aviation Administration temporarily closed airspace over the Carolina coast, including the airports in Myrtle Beach and Charleston, South Carolina, and Wilmington, North Carolina. The FAA rerouted air traffic from the area and warned of delays as a result of the flight restrictions. The FAA and Coast Guard worked to clear the airspace and water below the balloon as it reached the ocean.\\nTelevision footage showed a small explosion, followed by the giant deflated balloon descending like a ribbon toward the water.\\nBill Swanson said he watched the balloon deflate instantly from his house in Myrtle Beach as fighter jets circled around.\\n“When it deflated it was pretty close to instantaneous,” he said. “One second it’s there like a tiny moon and the next second it’s gone.” Swanson added that a trail of smoke followed the balloon as it dropped.\\n\",\n",

       "  '\\nPolicy lab is an innovative and novel idea to promote evidence-based policy, decision-making and problem-solving approaches for effective public service delivery in the world. Kathmandu University is the pioneer in introducing the KUSOM policy lab that connects the state and society for improving policy governance based on the principle of ‘University for state and societal transformation’ and offers unique opportunities for improving policy governance, indicating effective service delivery at federal, provincial, and local levels.\\nThe High-Level Meeting (https://www.prasashan.com/2022/04/22/315556/) on KUSOM Policy Lab between the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration (MOFAGA) and Kathmandu University at the Singha Durbar held on April 21, 2022 also illustrates the importance of policy lab for effectual policy-making and governance. The main objective of this meeting was to institutionalize the KUSOM Policy Lab into the government system in order to promote evidence-based policy making, and improve policy governance and law-making processes in Nepal.\\nKUSOM Policy Lab (http://policylab.ku.edu.np/) is the credible policy think tank and center of excellence in public policy and governance in Nepal. It promotes systematic and rigorous policy engagement for informed policy decision-making. Kathmandu University believes in USR-University for State and Social Responsibility. As an outreach of academic programs on public policy and management, Kathmandu University is committed to state and societal transformation based on the ‘University for State and Societal Transformation’ principle.\\nThe Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development (SDG 2030) has also highlighted the critical role of public institutions in the sixteenth SDG[1]in exploring paradigm shifts in government-society interactions that have had a significant impact on public administration and services. These are i) the demand for more people-centered governance, and ii) demand for high-quality human resources in the public sector to deal with increasingly more complex development imperatives. So, it requires sincere and judicious efforts to innovate the approaches of policy governance and effective public service delivery in the context of localizing the SDGs for inclusive transformation and solving the various policy governance issues of Nepal.\\nThus, the policy lab is unique in terms of offering a variety of ways to solve the policy related issues and problems in order to improve the policy governance and making effective public service delivery of federal, provincial and local governments. It has been prioritizing the following strategies for the same:\\ni. Reorienting the traditional ways of policy-making: The policy lab reorients the traditional ways of policy formulation process in terms of having democratic institutions and inclusive policy processes. It is the magical breakthrough and paradigm shift for improving traditional methods of policy formulation, monitoring, and evaluations.\\nii. Culture of evidence generation for policy decisions: It creates the culture of evidence generation to promote the evidence-based policy processes. It gathers and analyses the facts and information related to policy and people’s problems for informed and evidence-based policy decision-making.\\niii. Connecting the academia and public institutions: It connects the academia and state institutions based on University for State and Societal Responsibility (USR) to serve the state whereas the critical role of a public institution is the key to effective public service delivery.\\niv. Policy watch and monitoring: After the promulgation of the Constitution in 2015, it is the state’s responsibility and obligation to formulate the policies/laws in the spirit of the Constitution. But, policies are not being formulated considering this reality and the whole process is truncated. In this context, the policy lab monitors the policy formulation and implementation processes in regard with policy goals and constitutional spirit. It also assesses whether the public service delivery is effective or not, in line with policy goals and objectives, etc.\\nv. Policy evaluation: By and large, the practices of policy evaluation are lacking in Nepal. The structures, functions, and processes of KUSOM’s Policy Lab can help to address evaluation challenges mainly related to explaining why solutions work, translating research findings into decision-making involving policy stakeholders, and providing platforms for safe learning through experimentation. Hence, it will be instrumental for gaining a deeper understanding of challenges that relate to establishing what works, as well as valuing public interventions, incorporating systems thinking and complexity, and scaling-up solutions.\\nvi. Design Thinking and Human Centric Innovation: Methodologically, the Policy Lab employs multi-pronged strategies, such as design thinking and human-centric innovation, institutional and capacity building, policy advocacy and strategies, networking, and collaborating for synergy. The Policy Lab \\xa0accomplishes its objective by using a four-stage process i.e. i) Discover, ii) Design, iii) Evaluate, and iv) Scale up.\\xa0 Based on the evaluation of the designed policies and services, we then disseminate and scale it up that suits best for better service delivery.\\nvii. Globally connected with policy initiatives: The lab connects public institutions with global policy initiatives and best practices from different parts of the world to adapt the national and local policy processes including local/community-based initiatives. The novel and innovative ideas should be locally rooted for their sustaining and impactful effects.\\nviii. Scientific documentation and cases: The lab promotes and utilizes the case experimentation and scientific documentation of policy cases for informed and evidence-based policy decisions. It creates a culture of evidence generation for further policy advocacy. And, scientific documentation of policy processes is presented to relevant stakeholders and government ministries/departments of the government at the local, provincial, and federal levels to initiate dialogue with them on the promotion of such cases. The action makes use of the e-portal, to disseminate case stories on the topic as well as initiate public debate on the issue.\\nix. Evidence-based dialogue series and policy advocacy: The lab promotes evidence-based dialogue series based on policy research and knowledge. It brings all the diverse stakeholders for their common understanding, validating, and confirming the findings for wider policy advocacy and campaigning.\\nx. Transdisciplinary social justice initiatives: The lab connects transdisciplinary social justice initiatives with policy processes. The Transdisciplinary Social Policy Justice initiatives aim to connect social movement actors and academia for discourses on social policy and social justice issues where academia and practitioners can interact and generate pragmatic solutions for the underlying causes of redistributive social justice.\\nxi. Policy and scientific communications via policy knowledge products: Policy and scientific communication are also understood as part of policy analysis i.e. it unfolds the policy discourse and jargon for the convenience and understanding of policymakers who are very busy and heavily loaded with many important tasks and obligations. The very short, brief, and clear policy knowledge products would be easy for them for an informed policy decision-making process.\\nxii. Policy result demonstration and showcase: After diagnosing and rigorous analysis, it would demonstrate and showcase the public policy analysis and making process, thereby prescribing for informed decision making. It would develop confidence and satisfaction of all possible stakeholders engaged in public policy-making processes while addressing the contentious public policy and management issues, thereby improving people’s well-being and prosperity.\\nxiii. Policy innovation: By using human-centered design thinking principles, policy projects in the Policy Lab experiments, develops prototypes, proposes innovative ways to tackle the burning issues, and drive for policy innovations to serve the needs of the changing environmental and technological landscape.\\nxiv. Policy endowment fund for sustainability: The KU has established Policy Endowment Fund as sustaining the center of excellence in public policy and governance for students and faculties’ research, scholarship, and fellowships which will assist to sustain and foster the student and faculties led innovations, projects, and research.\\nFor these reasons, KUSOM Policy Lab is considered as an innovative, problem-solving approach to public policy issues for ensuring effective public service delivery. Hence, the lab can function as the center of excellence and policy think tank in Nepal for improving policy governance in Nepal. Based on scientific documentation of policy cases and generating knowledge-based policy, it can be a credible policy think tank and knowledge hub in Nepal.\\xa0 Hence, the KUSOM Policy Lab can act as a national policy hub, center of excellence, and national policy think tank for policy governance in Nepal.\\nIn a nutshell, KUSOM’s Policy Lab has been designed after realizing the need to bring evidence and policymaking closer together while acknowledging that academic evidence is only one ingredient in the policymaking process. Policymaking can be improved not only through access to the latest research, thinking, and evidence, playing the role of policy brokerage, but also through innovative approaches, tools, methods, practices, and interactive spaces to bring different stakeholders together.\\nSince it recognizes the sincere and honest efforts of state and non-state actors including political parties, civil societies, media, and local communities for policy-making and governance, the KUSOM policy lab can be an inclusive platform for all. Hence, it can be a hub for innovating the South-Asian perspective for public policy and governance.\\nWhile innovating public policy governance, KUSOM’s Policy Lab is likely to be a forum for open, honest conversations around a policy topic, creating new networks, collaborations, and partnerships between academics and policymakers, synthesizing available evidence on a policy topic in a robust and accessible format and providing timely access to evidence relevant to a policy issue. This process serves to build a coalition through the participation of diverse communities, work on the language and presentation of evidence and engage policymakers early to respond when policy windows emerge.\\nFurthermore, by working together to get evidence into the hands of policymakers, the media, civil society organizations, and other actors and think tanks, the KUSOM policy lab can influence public policy debates by promoting more objective, evidence-based decision-making. It can add policy relevance to academic research and theoretical and methodological rigor to think tanks’ research while improving the overall quantity and quality of evidence for policy-making.\\n(The author is Associate Professor and Program Director, Master of Public Policy and Management (MPPM) Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM), Balkumari, Lalitpur)\\n\\xa0\\n',\n",

His representatives have denied all accusations of non-consensual sex.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe DGA represents more than 16,000 industry professionals including directors and members of directing teams. Although Weinstein was most well-known for producing films, he has a co-directing credit on the 1986 film “Playing for Keeps” with his brother Bob Weinstein.

She is the second woman from her home country to earn the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe runner-up was Miss Colombia Laura Gonzalez, while the second runner-up was Miss Jamaica Davina Bennett.\\r\\n\\r\\nNinety-two women from around the world participated in the decades-old competition. This year’s edition had the most contestants ever, including the first representatives in its history of Cambodia, Laos and Nepal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen asked to name the most important issue women face in the workplace, Nel-Peters said the lack of equal pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In some places, women get paid 75 percent of what men earn for doing the same job, working the same hours, and I do not believe that is right,” said Nel-Peters, who recently earned a business management degree. “I think we should have equal work for equal pay for women all over the world.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNel-Peters is from the South African coastal community of Sedgefield in the Western Cape province. She helped develop a program to train women in self-defense in various situations after she was robbed at gunpoint a month after she was crowned Miss South Africa.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe subject of sexual harassment against women, which has dominated headlines in the U.S. over the past two months, was raised during the pageant. In response to a question, Jamaica’s Bennett said no form of abuse, including sexual harassment, should be tolerated, and any instances of sexual harassment should be brought to authorities.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the U.S., dozens of politicians, Hollywood executives and actors, and media personalities are facing accusations of sexual misconduct, sparked by a wave of allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the show, Nel-Peters said women can empower each other to standup against any abuse.\\r\\n\\r\\n“You feel so empowered because you are on a stage with 91 other women that are strong, that are independent, that have worked really hard,” she said. “They are all winners; they are winners of their own countries, and to me, that was so empowering. That just showed me that if women take hands and stand together, we are unbreakable and we can say no to the things that are wrong in the workplace, at home or wherever you might go.”\\r\\n\\r\\nSteve Harvey returned as the show’s host despite botching the 2015 Miss Universe crowning. On Sunday, he poked fun at his mistake throughout the night. Three days after people in the U.S. celebrated Thanksgiving, Harvey told the audience he is “grateful for the Oscars,” referring to the best-picture flub at this year’s Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrammy-Award winner Fergie performed her new song “A Little Work” while the contestants walked down the stage wearing evening gowns. This year’s judges included YouTube star Lele Pons, former judge of “America’s Next Top Model” Jay Manuel and Wendy Fitzwilliam, the 1998 Miss Universe winner from Trinidad and Tobago.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresident Donald Trump offended Hispanics when he made anti-immigrant remarks in announcing his bid for the White House in 2015. At the time, he co-owned The Miss Universe Organization with NBCUniversal, but the network and the Spanish-language broadcaster Univision quickly cut ties with him, refusing to air the show. Trump sued both networks, eventually settling and selling off the entire pageant to talent management company WME/IMG.\\n',\n",

Spokeswoman Joan Vollero said New York police were also involved, but further details could not be provided.\\r\\n\\r\\nDe la Huerta spoke to CBS News by phone and said the first rape occurred in October 2010 after Weinstein gave her a ride home from a party, insisted on having a drink in her apartment and forced himself on her. She said the second rape occurred in December 2010 after Weinstein came to her apartment; she had been drinking and was not in a condition to give consent, CBS reported the actress said.\\r\\n\\r\\nLos Angeles police are investigating allegations about Weinstein that occurred in 2015, but spokesman Josh Rubenstein said he could not provide any additional details. The department is also investigating a report by an Italian actress and model who said she was raped by Weinstein in 2013.\\r\\n\\xa0Weinstein representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated a statement that Weinstein, 65, denies all allegations of non-consensual sex.\\r\\nAuthorities in Beverly Hills and London are also investigating Weinstein for possible criminal cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe investigations came four weeks after The New York Times published an expose of sexual harassment allegations against Weinstein, leading to his firing from the company he co-founded and his expulsion from the producers guild and the organization that bestows the Academy Awards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe accusations against Weinstein have prompted numerous allegations of sexual harassment and abuse against powerful men in Hollywood and other industries.\\r\\n\\r\\nCNN reported on Thursday that eight current or former “House of Cards” workers claim that Kevin Spacey made the production a “toxic” workplace and one ex-employee alleges the actor sexually assaulted him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workers’ identities were withheld from Thursday’s report because they fear professional fallout, the cable news channel said.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong them is a former production assistant who alleged that Spacey assaulted him during one of the Netflix show’s early seasons, and CNN reported that all of the people described Spacey’s behavior as predatory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report accuses Spacey of allegedly targeting staffers who were typically young and male with nonconsensual touching and crude comments.\\r\\n\\r\\nNetflix has suspended production on the series, which was slated to end after its sixth season. The streaming service and “House of Cards” producers said Thursday that one allegation against Spacey involved a remark and gesture made during production of the show’s first season in 2012. After, Spacey willingly participated in training and producer Media Rights Capital said it was not aware of any additional complaints against the actor since then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe production company said it has instituted a hotline for complaints and will investigate them thoroughly. There was no word on the fate of “House of Cards” in Thursday’s statements.\\r\\n\\r\\nA person with knowledge of the decision said late Thursday that Spacey’s publicist and talent agency CAA have parted ways with the actor.

The attorney said Weinstein’s ability to testify would be limited without waiving his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.\\n',\n",

His father was also a player.\\nPelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.\\nThe name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.\\nPelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.\\n“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”\\nThe 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.\\nHe changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.\\nIn all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.\\nHis run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season.

It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos.

Pelé said he was ready “to play 90 minutes, plus extra time,” but soon started chemotherapy.\\nBorn Edson Arantes do Nascimento, in the small city of Tres Coracoes in the interior of Minas Gerais state on Oct. 23, 1940, Pelé grew up shining shoes to buy his modest soccer gear. His father was also a player.\\nPelé’s talent drew notice when he was 11, and a local professional player brought him to Santos’ youth squads. Despite his youth and 5-foot-8 frame Pelé’ scored against grown men with the same ease he displayed against friends back home. He debuted with the Brazilian club at 15 in 1956, and the club quickly gained worldwide recognition.\\nThe name Pelé came from him mispronouncing the name of a player called Bilé. He later became known simply as ‘O Rei’ – The King.\\nPelé went to the 1958 World Cup as a reserve but became a key part for his country’s championship team. His first goal, in which he flicked the ball over the head of a defender and raced around him to volley it home, was voted as one of the best in World Cup history.\\n“When Pelé scored,” veteran Swedish midfielder Sigge Parling said, “I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding.”\\nThe 1966 World Cup in England — won by the hosts — was a bitter one for Pelé, by then already considered the world’s top player. Brazil was knocked out at the group stage and Pelé, angry at fouls and hard tackles by Portugal, swore it was his last World Cup.\\nHe changed his mind and was rejuvenated in the 1970 World Cup. In a game against England, he struck a header for a certain score, but the great goalkeeper Gordon Banks flipped the ball over the bar in an astonishing move. Pelé likened the save — one of the best in World Cup history — to a “salmon climbing up a waterfall.” Later, he scored the opening goal in the final against Italy, his last World Cup match.\\nIn all, Pelé played 114 matches with Brazil, scoring a record 95 goals — including 77 in official matches. Most of his goals came with Santos, which he led to five national titles, two Copa Libertadores trophies and two club world championships — all in the 1960s.\\nHis run with Santos stretched over three decades until he went into semi-retirement after the 1972 season. Wealthy European clubs tried to sign him, but the Brazilian government intervened to keep him from being sold, declaring him a national treasure.\\nOn the field, Pelé’s energy, vision and imagination drove a gifted Brazilian national team, with intricate passing combinations slicing defenses while leaving room for players to showcase flashy skills.\\nThe fast, fluid style of play exemplified “O Jogo Bonito” — Portuguese for “The Beautiful Game.” And at the center of it all, like a maestro in command of his orchestra, was Pelé. It was his 1977 autobiography, “My Life and the Beautiful Game,” that made the phrase part of soccer’s lexicon.\\nIn 1975, he joined the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League. Although he was past his prime at 34 years old, Pelé briefly gave soccer a higher profile in North America before ending his career on Oct. 1, 1977, in an exhibition between the Cosmos and Santos. Among the dignitaries on hand was perhaps the only other athlete whose renown spanned the globe — Muhammad Ali.\\nPelé had two daughters out of wedlock and five children from his first two marriages, to Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi and Assiria Seixas Lemos. He later married businesswoman Marcia Cibele Aoki.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nIndustry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nA huge, high-altitude Chinese balloon sailed across the U.S. on Friday, drawing severe Pentagon accusations of spying on sensitive military sites despite China’s firm denials. Secretary of State Antony Blinken abruptly canceled a high-stakes Beijing trip aimed at easing U.S.-China tensions.\\nAside from the government response, fuzzy videos dotted social media as people with binoculars and telephoto lenses tried to find the “spy balloon” in the sky as it headed southeastward over Kansas and Missouri at 60,000 feet (18,300 meters).\\nIt was spotted earlier over Montana, which is home to one of America’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base, defense officials said.\\nLater Friday, the Pentagon acknowledged reports of a second balloon flying over Latin America. “We now assess it is another Chinese surveillance balloon,” Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement, declining to offer further information such as where it was spotted.\\nThe U.S. actually had been tracking the initial balloon since at least Tuesday, when President Joe Biden was first briefed, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. According to three U.S. officials, Biden was initially inclined to order the surveillance balloon to be blown out of the sky, and a senior defense official said the U.S. had prepared fighter jets, including F-22s, to shoot it down if ordered.\\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, strongly advised Biden against shooting down the balloon, warning that its size — as big as three school buses — and considerable weight could create a debris field large enough to endanger Americans on the ground. The Pentagon also assessed that after unspecified U.S. measures, the possibility of the balloon uncovering important information was not great.\\nIt was not the first time Chinese surveillance balloons have been tracked over U.S. territory, including at least once during former President Donald Trump’s administration, officials said.\\nBlinken’s trip cancellation came despite China’s claim that the balloon was merely a weather research “airship” that had blown off course. The Pentagon rejected that out of hand — as well as China’s contention that the balloon was not being used for surveillance and had only limited navigational ability.\\nBlinken, who had been due to depart Washington for Beijing late Friday, said he had told senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi in a phone call that sending the balloon over the U.S. was “an irresponsible act and that (China’s) decision to take this action on the eve of my visit is detrimental to the substantive discussions that we were prepared to have.”\\nChina’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement Saturday morning: “In actuality, the U.S. and China have never announced any visit. The U.S. making any such announcement is their own business, and we respect that.”\\nAccording to Beijing, Wang said China “has always strictly followed international law, we do not accept any groundless speculation and hype. Faced with unexpected situations, both parties need to keep calm, communicate in a timely manner, avoid misjudgments and manage differences.”\\nAfter passing the sensitive military sites in Montana, the balloon was moving southeastward over the heartland of the central United States during the day and was expected to remain in U.S. airspace for several days, officials said.\\nThe development dealt a new blow to already strained U.S.-Chinese relations that have been in a downward spiral for years over numerous issues. Still, U.S. officials maintained that diplomatic channels remain open and Blinken said he remained willing to travel to China “when conditions allow.”\\n“We continue to believe that having open lines of communication is important,” he said.\\nBiden declined to comment on the matter when questioned at an economic event. Two likely 2024 reelection challengers, Trump, and Nikki Haley, the former South Carolina governor and U.N. ambassador, said the U.S. should immediately shoot down the balloon.\\nSeveral Republican congressmen said the same, and a number blasted the administration for “allowing” the balloon intrusion.\\n“The idea that Communist China has a spy balloon headed towards Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri right now — the home of the Stealth Bomber — is absolutely unbelievable,” said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. “No American should accept this. I don’t.”\\nJean-Pierre did not shed light on why the administration waited until Thursday to make its concerns public.\\nRyder, the Pentagon press secretary, refused to say Friday whether there was any new consideration of shooting the balloon down. He said it currently was posing no threat.\\nRyder said it was maneuverable, not just at the mercy of the wind, and had changed course.\\nStill, weather experts said China’s claim that the balloon had gone off course was not unfeasible. China’s account of wind patterns known as the Westerlies carrying a balloon to the western United States was “absolutely possible — not possible, likely,” said Dan Jaffe, a professor of atmospheric chemistry at the University of Washington.\\nAs for Blinken’s trip, Jean-Pierre said a diplomatic visit to China was not appropriate at such a time. She said that “the presence of this balloon in our airspace ... is a clear violation of our sovereignty as well as international law and it is unacceptable this occurred.”\\nA State Department official said Blinken and Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman had both protested to the top official at the Chinese Embassy on Wednesday, a day before the Pentagon announced the discovery of the balloon.\\nBlinken’s long-anticipated meetings with senior Chinese officials had been seen in both countries as a possible way to find some areas of common ground at a time of major disagreements over Taiwan, human rights, China’s claims in the South China Sea, North Korea, Russia’s war in Ukraine, trade policy and climate change.\\nAlthough the trip, which was agreed to in November by Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping at a summit in Indonesia, had not been formally announced, officials in both Beijing and Washington had spoken in recent days about Blinken’s imminent arrival for meetings on Sunday and Monday.\\nChina, which angrily denounces surveillance attempts by the U.S. and others over areas it considers to be its territory and once forced down an American spy plane and held its crew captive on Hainan Island, was relatively conciliatory in its response to the U.S. complaints.\\nIn a statement that approached an apology, the Chinese foreign ministry said the balloon was a civilian airship used mainly for meteorological research. It said said the airship had limited “self-steering” capabilities and had “deviated far from its planned course” because of winds.\\n“The Chinese side regrets the unintended entry of the airship into U.S. airspace due to force majeure,” the statement said, citing a legal term used to refer to events beyond one’s control.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nAfter months of agonizing, the U.S has agreed to send longer-range bombs to Ukraine as it prepares to launch a spring offensive to retake territory Russia captured last year, U.S. officials said Thursday, confirming that the new weapons will have roughly double the range of any other offensive weapon provided by America.\\nThe U.S. will provide ground-launched small diameter bombs as part of a $2.17 billion aid package it is expected to announce Friday, several U.S. officials said. The package also for the first time includes equipment to connect all the different air defense systems Western allies have rushed to the battlefield and integrate them into Ukraine’s own air defenses, to help it better defend against Russia’s missile attacks.\\nFor months, U.S. officials have hesitated to send longer-range systems to Ukraine out of concern that they would be used to target inside Russia, escalating the conflict and drawing the U.S. deeper in. The longer-range bombs are the latest advanced system, such as Abrams tanks and the Patriot missile defense system, that the U.S. has eventually agreed to provide Ukraine after initially saying no. U.S. officials, though, have continued to reject Ukraine’s requests for fighter jets.\\nUkrainian leaders have urgently pressed for longer-range munitions, and on Thursday officials said the U.S. will send an undisclosed number of the ground-launched, small diameter bombs, which have a range of about 95 miles (150 kilometers). The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details of the aid package not yet made public.\\nTo date, the longest-range missile provided by the U.S. is about 50 miles (80 kilometers). The funding in the aid package is for longer-term purchases, so it wasn’t clear Thursday how long it will take to get the bomb to the battlefield in Ukraine.\\nUkraine’s defense minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Thursday the country is prepared to offer guarantees to its Western partners that their weapons won’t be used to strike inside Russian territory, adding that Kyiv needs weapons with a range of up to 300 kilometers ( about 185 miles) to expel the Russian forces.\\n“If we could strike at a distance of up to 300 kilometers, the Russian army wouldn’t be able to mount a defense and will have to withdraw,” Reznikov said at a meeting with EU officials. “Ukraine is ready to provide any guarantees that your weapons will not be involved in attacks on the Russian territory. We have enough targets in the occupied areas of Ukraine, and we’re prepared to coordinate on (these) targets with our partners.”\\nThe U.S. aid package includes $425 million in ammunition and support equipment that will be pulled from existing Pentagon stockpiles and $1.75 billion in new funding through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is used to purchase new weapons from industry.\\nThe assistance initiative, which will pay for the longer-range bombs and the air defense system integration, also funds two HAWK air defense systems, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, and counter-drone systems.\\nSince Russia’s invasion last February, Western allies have pledged a myriad of air defense systems to Ukraine to bolster its own Soviet-made S-300 surface-to-air missile defense systems, and the latest aid package aims to provide the capability to integrate them all, which could improve Ukraine’s ability to protect itself against incoming Russian attacks.\\nThe U.S. has pledged medium- to long-range National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems, or NASAMS, and truck-launched short-range Avenger air defense systems; the Netherlands, Germany and the U.S. are sending Patriot missile defense systems; Germany is sending medium-range IRIS-T air defense systems; and Spain is sending Aspide anti-aircraft air defense systems.\\nThe addition of longer-range bombs to the latest aid package was first reported by Reuters.\\nUkraine is still seeking F-16 fighter jets, which U.S. President Joe Biden has opposed sending since the beginning of the war. Asked Monday if his administration was considering sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, Biden responded, “No.”\\nOn Tuesday, the Ukrainian defense minister was asked if Biden’s ”no” to F-16s was the final word.\\n“All types of help first passed through the ‘no’ stage,” Reznikov said. “Which only means ‘no’ at today’s given moment. The second stage is, ‘Let’s talk and study technical possibilities.’ The third stage is, ‘Let’s get your personnel trained.’ And the fourth stage is the transfer (of equipment).”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe U.S. is tracking a suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that has been spotted over U.S. airspace for a couple days, but the Pentagon decided not to shoot it down due to risks of harm for people on the ground, officials said Thursday. The discovery of the balloon puts a further strain on U.S.-China relations at a time of heightened tensions.\\nA senior defense official told Pentagon reporters that the U.S. has “very high confidence” it is a Chinese high-altitude balloon and it was flying over sensitive sites to collect information. One of the places the balloon was spotted was Montana, which is home to one of the nation’s three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive information.\\nBrig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, Pentagon press secretary, provided a brief statement on the issue, saying the government continues to track the balloon. He said it is “currently traveling at an altitude well above commercial air traffic and does not present a military or physical threat to people on the ground.”\\nHe said similar balloon activity has been seen in the past several years. He added that the U.S. took steps to ensure it did not collect sensitive information.\\nThe defense official said the U.S. has “engaged” Chinese officials through multiple channels and communicated the seriousness of the matter.\\nThe incident comes as Secretary of State Antony Blinken was supposed to make his first trip to Beijing, expected this weekend, to try to find some common ground. Although the trip has not been formally announced, both Beijing and Washington have been talking about his imminent arrival.\\nIt was not immediately clear if the discovery of the balloon would impact Blinken’s travel plans.\\nThe senior defense official said the U.S. did get fighter jets, including F-22s, ready to shoot down the balloon if ordered to by the White House. The Pentagon ultimately recommended against it, noting that even as the balloon was over a sparsely populated area of Montana, its size would create a debris field large enough that it could have put people at risk.\\nIt was not clear what the military was doing to prevent it from collecting sensitive information or what will happen with the balloon if it isn’t shot down.\\nIn a letter sent Thursday to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., wrote: “The fact that this balloon was occupying Montana airspace creates significant concern that Malmstrom Air Force Base and the United States’ intercontinental ballistic missile fields are the target of this intelligence gathering mission. ... It is vital to establish the flight path of this balloon, any compromised U.S. national security assets, and all telecom or IT infrastructure on the ground within the U.S. that this spy balloon was utilizing.”\\nThe defense official said the spy balloon was trying to fly over the Montana missile fields, but the U.S. has assessed that it has “limited” value in terms of providing China intelligence it couldn’t already collect by other means, such through spy satellites.\\nThe official would not specify the size of the balloon, but said it was large enough that despite its high altitude, commercial pilots could see it. All air traffic was halted at Montana’s Billings Logan International Airport from 1:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m. Wednesday, as the military provided options to the White House.\\nA photograph of a large white balloon lingering over the area was captured by The Billings Gazette, but the Pentagon would not confirm if that was the surveillance balloon. The balloon could be seen drifting in and out of clouds and had what appeared to be a solar array hanging from the bottom, said Gazette photographer Larry Mayer.\\nThe defense official said what concerned them about this launch was the altitude the balloon was flying at and the length of time it lingered over a location, without providing specifics.\\nMontana Gov. Greg Gianforte said he was briefed Wednesday about the situation after the Montana National Guard was notified of an ongoing military operation taking place in Montana airspace, according to a statement from the Republican governor and spokesperson Brooke Stroyke.\\n“From the spy balloon to the Chinese Communist Party spying on Americans through TikTok to CCP-linked companies buying American farmland, I’m deeply troubled by the constant stream of alarming developments for our national security,” Gianforte said in a statement.\\nTensions with China are particularly high on numerous issues, ranging from Taiwan and the South China Sea to human rights in China’s western Xinjiang region and the clampdown on democracy activists in Hong Kong. Not least on that list of irritants are China’s tacit support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, its refusal to rein in North Korea’s expanding ballistic missile program and ongoing disputes over trade and technology.\\nOn Tuesday, Taiwan scrambled fighter jets, put its navy on alert and activated missile systems in response to nearby operations by 34 Chinese military aircraft and nine warships that are part Beijing’s strategy to unsettle and intimidate the self-governing island democracy.\\nTwenty of those aircraft crossed the central line in the Taiwan Strait that has long been an unofficial buffer zone between the two sides, which separated during a civil war in 1949.\\nBeijing has also increased preparations for a potential blockade or military action against Taiwan, which has stirred increasing concern among military leaders, diplomats and elected officials in the U.S., Taiwan’s key ally.\\nThe surveillance balloon was first reported by NBC News.\\nSome Montana residents reported seeing an unusual object in the sky around the time of the airport shutdown Wednesday, but it’s not clear that what they were seeing was the balloon.\\nFrom an office window in Billings, Chase Doak said he saw a “big white circle in the sky” that he said was too small to be the moon.\\nHe took some photos, then ran home to get a camera with a stronger lens and took more photos and video. He could see it for about 45 minutes and it appeared stationary, but Doak said the video suggested it was slowly moving.\\n“I thought maybe it was a legitimate UFO,” he said. “So I wanted to make sure I documented it and took as many photos as I could.”\\n',\n",

But the share offering had drawn nearly 51 million bids, exceeding the 45.5 million offered to the public. Stock in six of Adani’s other listed companies sank between 2% and 19%.\\nEarly Thursday, Adani Enterprises was down by 5%. Stocks in four of Adani’s other listed companies were down by 10% and two others sunk between 5% and 8%.\\nIn a video address Thursday, Adani said the decision to scrap the share offering was made “to insulate the investors from potential losses.”\\n“For me, the interest of my investors is paramount and everything else is secondary,” he said.\\nAdani Enterprises said in a statement that it would withdraw the transaction and return the money to its investors. The decision would not “have any impact on our existing operations and future plans,” it said, adding that the group’s balance sheet was “very healthy” with strong cashflows and secure assets.\\nAdani made a vast fortune mining coal as energy-hungry India grew swiftly after its economy was liberalized in the 1990s. Adani companies operate airports in major cities, build roads, generate electricity, manufacture defense equipment, develop agricultural drones, sell cooking oil and run a media outlet.\\nHindenburg said it was betting against the group, accusing it of “pulling the largest con in corporate history.” It said it judged the seven key Adani listed companies to have an “85% downside, purely on a fundamental basis owing to sky-high valuations.”\\nMost of the allegations involved concerns about the group’s debt levels, activities of top executives, use of offshore shell companies to artificially boost share prices and past investigations into fraud. It listed 88 questions for the group to answer.\\nAdani Group dismissed Hindenburg’s allegations, and called its report a “calculated attack on India, the independence, integrity and quality of Indian institutions, and the growth story and ambition of India.” On Sunday, it issued a 413-page report that rejected its questions, saying none were “based on independent or journalistic fact finding.”\\nAdani’s response included documents and data tables. It said the group has made all necessary regulatory disclosures and abided by local laws.\\nThe stock losses on Wednesday cost Adani his title as the richest man in Asia and in India. Adani also slid from a ranking of being the world’s third richest man to the 13th as his fortune plummeted to $72 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Prior to the Hindenburg report, his net worth was about $120 billion.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe FBI searched US President Joe Biden’s vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on Wednesday without turning up any classified documents, the latest turn in an extraordinary series of searches of his and his predecessor’s properties.\\nAgents did take some handwritten notes and other materials relating to Biden’s time as vice president for review, just as they had when they searched his Wilmington home last month where they also found classified items. Investigators searched his former office at a Washington think tank that bears his name in November, but it isn’t clear whether they took anything.\\nThe Biden searches, conducted with his blessing, have come as investigators work to determine how classified information from his time as a senator and vice president came to wind up in his home and former office — and whether any mishandling involved criminal intent or was merely a mistake in a city where unauthorized treatment of classified documents is not unheard-of.\\nLaw enforcement searches of property are a routine part of criminal probes, but there is nothing ordinary about the FBI scouring a sitting president’s home, even as Biden and his aides have sought to contrast his actions with those of his predecessor.\\nFormer President Donald Trump is facing a special counsel criminal investigation into his retention of several hundred classified documents and other government records at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida — and his resistance to giving them up, which led to an FBI warrant and search to seize them last August.\\nOn Wednesday, Biden’s personal attorney Bob Bauer said FBI agents authorized by the Department of Justice spent three and a half hours searching the president’s beach home and that “no documents with classified markings were found.”\\nIn a statement disclosing the search, Bauer sought to portray Biden and his team as fully transparent and cooperative. He described the search as “planned” and “a further step in a thorough and timely DOJ process we will continue to fully support and facilitate.”\\nHe did not mention Trump by name, but the statement seemed aimed at juxtaposing the Biden investigation with the Trump case, where months of fruitless Justice Department efforts to recover all the classified records taken to the former president’s Florida estate culminated in the August search warrant and removal of nearly three dozen boxes of documents and other items.\\nSearches of Biden’s former office and Delaware homes, by contrast, have all been done voluntarily and without a warrant. But the fact the FBI did its own search reflected the Justice Department’s determination to retrieve any and all possible classified items rather than rely on assurances that such documents had been located.\\nBiden has said he was surprised by the initial trove discovered by his lawyers in November when they were cleaning out an office inside the Penn Biden Center.\\nThe latest search follows the FBI’s 13-hour, top-to-bottom check of his Wilmington, Delaware, home, where agents located documents with classified markings from his time as a vice president and senator and also took possession of some of his handwritten notes.\\nOne week earlier, Biden’s personal lawyers revealed that they had found a document bearing classified markings while searching the Wilmington property but said they had not found others during a separate inspection of the Rehoboth Beach home.\\nThe White House did not disclose the Justice Department’s investigation until last month, when it acknowledged the Nov. 2 discovery of a “small number” of classified documents by Biden lawyers as they closed an office at the Penn Biden Center, a think tank affiliated with the Ivy League school.\\nThough officials have not disclosed this, The Associated Press and other news organizations reported on Tuesday that the FBI had conducted a voluntary search of that office later in November.\\nThe administration’s public response has been delayed and incomplete. There are many unanswered questions - on what information the documents contained, exactly how many were discovered and why he had them in his possession, despite Biden’s attorneys and the White House Counsel’s insistence they are being as transparent as possible with the public.\\n“I think we’ve been pretty transparent from the very beginning,” a spokesman for the White House Counsel’s office, Ian Sams, said Wednesday. “We want to be careful to be very respectful of the integrity of that ongoing investigation.”\\nSams reiterated that Biden was working with Justice investigators.\\n“The president has been fully cooperative in offering unprecedented access to his home ... every single room of his home in Rehoboth as well as the one in Wilmington,” he said.\\nThe Justice Department declined comment on the Wednesday search.\\nBiden’s lawyers have described the retention of the records as a “mistake.” The Justice Department has historically brought criminal charges related to mishandling of classified records only when it can establish, among other things, that a person acted knowingly in improperly removing or storing sensitive records.\\nThe Biden documents probe is being handled by a special counsel, Robert Hur, a former senior Justice Department official during the Trump administration who served as the top federal prosecutor in Baltimore. He is starting his work this week, inheriting a months-long investigation already undertaken by FBI agents and Justice Department prosecutors.\\nAttorney General Merrick Garland had assigned the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, to conduct an initial review before announcing Hur’s appointment last month.\\nIn a separate effort that preceded the Biden probe, special counsel Jack Smith is investigating the retention by Trump of roughly 300 documents with classified markings that were taken from the White House to Mar-a-Lago. Agents last August obtained a search warrant to recover classified documents following what the Justice Department said were months of resistance by Trump and his representatives to return the records to the government.\\nInvestigators in the Biden case have already conducted interviews, including of Biden’s former executive assistant who helped oversee the packing of boxes that went to the Penn Biden Center. It is not yet clear if and when the Justice Department might look to question Biden himself.\\nThe Bidens purchased their Rehoboth Beach home, which overlooks a state park adjacent to the beach, in June 2017, months after he left the vice presidency.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reaffirmed Wednesday that Turkey won’t allow Sweden to join the NATO military alliance as long as the Scandinavian country permits protests desecrating Islam’s holy book to take place.\\nTurkey, which had already been holding off approving Sweden and Finland’s membership in the Western military alliance, has been infuriated by a series of separate demonstrations in Stockholm. In one case a solitary anti-Islam activist burned the Quran outside the Turkish Embassy, while in an unconnected protest an effigy of Erdogan was hanged. Even before that, Ankara had been pressing Sweden and Finland to crack down on exiled members of Kurdish and other groups it sees as terrorists, and to allow arms sales to Turkey.\\nTurkey has indefinitely postponed a key meeting in Brussels that would have discussed the two Nordic countries’ NATO entry.\\n“Sweden, don’t even bother! As long as you allow my holy book, the Quran, to be burned and torn, and you do so together with your security forces, we will not say ‘yes’ to your entry into NATO,” Erdogan said in a speech to his ruling party’s legislators.\\nSwedish government officials have distanced themselves from the protests, including by a far-right anti-Islam activist who burned copies of the Quran in Stockholm and Copenhagen, Denmark, while also stressing that the demonstrations are protected by freedom of speech.\\nOn Tuesday, Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson denounced the activists who carried out the demonstrations as “useful idiots” for foreign powers who want to inflict harm on the Scandinavian country as it seeks to join NATO.\\n“We have seen how foreign actors, even state actors, have used these manifestations to inflame the situation in a way that is directly harmful to Swedish security,” Kristersson told reporters in Stockholm, without naming any countries.\\nSweden and neighboring Finland abandoned decades of nonalignment and applied to join NATO in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. All NATO members except Turkey and Hungary have ratified their accession, but unanimity is required.\\nIn a television interview Wednesday, Erdogan suggested that Sweden needs to prevent Quran burning protests.\\n“Hate crimes against Muslims under the guise of freedom of expression are unacceptable. We expect that the beliefs of all groups are respected and sincere steps are taken in the fight against Islamophobia,” he told state broadcaster TRT.\\nIn Finland, which has seen no anti-Turkish or anti-Islam demonstrations, violating religious peace is punishable by law, and desecrating a book held sacred by a religious community would likely violate that law. As a result, police wouldn’t allow a protest that involved burning the Quran.\\nThere is no similar legislation in other Nordic countries, Finnish public broadcaster YLE said.\\nYLE reported Tuesday that a group of anti-NATO demonstrators had planned to burn the Quran in Helsinki last week but changed their minds after police got wind of their plan on social media and intervened.\\nEarlier on Wednesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Ankara has fewer problems with Finland becoming NATO member than with its neighbor Sweden. He stressed, however, that it was up to the military alliance to decide whether to accept one country only or the Nordic duo together — something that both countries are committed to.\\nShould NATO decide to deal with the membership processes of the Nordic neighbors separately, “(Turkey) will then of course reconsider (ratifying) Finland’s membership separately and more favorably, I can say,” Cavusoglu said during a joint news conference with his Estonian colleague in Tallinn. He didn’t give a time frame.\\nErdogan also repeated that Turkey’s view on Finland’s membership was “positive.”\\nMeanwhile, Swedish Foreign Minister Tobias Billström told Swedish news agency TT that his country was complying with an agreement reached by Turkey, Sweden and Finland last year, but said that “religion is not part of the agreement.”\\n“Having said that, I fully understand that people take offense to the burning of holy writings and perceive it as deeply hurtful,” he said.\\n“What is needed now is for the situation to cool down on all sides,” Billström said, adding that talks with Turkey on the implementation of the agreement were continuing. With the joint memorandum signed last year, Sweden and Finland agreed to address Turkey’s security concerns.\\nThe minister also tied Erdogan’s comments to Turkish domestic politics.\\nErdogan, who faces a tough presidential election in May amid an economic downturn and high inflation, is expected use his strong-arming of Sweden to rally nationalist support.\\n“Right now there is an election campaign going on in Turkey and in election campaigns many things are said,” Billström said.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\n\\xa0Boeing bid farewell to an icon on Tuesday, delivering its final 747 jumbo jet as thousands of workers who helped build the planes over the past 55 years looked on.\\nSince its first flight in 1969, the giant yet graceful 747 has served as a cargo plane, a commercial aircraft capable of carrying nearly 500 passengers, a transport for NASA’s space shuttles, and the Air Force One US presidential aircraft. It revolutionized travel, connecting international cities that had never before had direct routes and helping democratize passenger flight.\\nBut over about the past 15 years, Boeing and its European rival Airbus have introduced more profitable and fuel efficient wide-body planes, with only two engines to maintain instead of the 747′s four. The final plane is the 1,574th built by Boeing in the Puget Sound region of Washington state.\\nThousands of workers joined Boeing and other industry executives from around the world — as well as actor and pilot John Travolta, who has flown 747s — Tuesday for a ceremony in the company’s massive factory north of Seattle, marking the delivery of the last one to cargo carrier Atlas Air.\\n“If you love this business, you’ve been dreading this moment,” said longtime aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia. “Nobody wants a four-engine airliner anymore, but that doesn’t erase the tremendous contribution the aircraft made to the development of the industry or its remarkable legacy.”\\nBoeing set out to build the 747 after losing a contract for a huge military transport, the C-5A. The idea was to take advantage of the new engines developed for the transport — high-bypass turbofan engines, which burned less fuel by passing air around the engine core, enabling a farther flight range — and to use them for a newly imagined civilian aircraft.\\nIt took more than 50,000 Boeing workers less than 16 months to churn out the first 747 — a Herculean effort that earned them the nickname “The Incredibles.” The jumbo jet’s production required the construction of a massive factory in Everett, north of Seattle — the world’s largest building by volume. The factory wasn’t even completed when the first planes were finished.\\nAmong those in attendance was Desi Evans, 92, who joined Boeing at its factory in Renton, south of Seattle, in 1957 and went on to spend 38 years at the company before retiring. One day in 1967, his boss told him he’d be joining the 747 program in Everett — the next morning.\\n“They told me, ‘Wear rubber boots, a hard hat and dress warm, because it’s a sea of mud,’” Evans recalled. “And it was — they were getting ready for the erection of the factory.”\\nHe was assigned as a supervisor to help figure out how the interior of the passenger cabin would be installed and later oversaw crews that worked on sealing and painting the planes.\\n“When that very first 747 rolled out, it was an incredible time,” he said as he stood before the last plane, parked outside the factory. “You felt elated — like you’re making history. You’re part of something big, and it’s still big, even if this is the last one.”\\nThe plane’s fuselage was 225 feet (68.5 meters) long and the tail stood as tall as a six-story building. The plane’s design included a second deck extending from the cockpit back over the first third of the plane, giving it a distinctive hump and inspiring a nickname, the Whale. More romantically, the 747 became known as the Queen of the Skies.\\nSome airlines turned the second deck into a first-class cocktail lounge, while even the lower deck sometimes featured lounges or even a piano bar. One decommissioned 747, originally built for Singapore Airlines in 1976, has been converted into a 33-room hotel near the airport in Stockholm.\\n“It was the first big carrier, the first widebody, so it set a new standard for airlines to figure out what to do with it, and how to fill it,” said Guillaume de Syon, a history professor at Pennsylvania’s Albright College who specializes in aviation and mobility. “It became the essence of mass air travel: You couldn’t fill it with people paying full price, so you need to lower prices to get people onboard. It contributed to what happened in the late 1970s with the deregulation of air travel.”\\nThe first 747 entered service in 1970 on Pan Am’s New York-London route, and its timing was terrible, Aboulafia said. It debuted shortly before the oil crisis of 1973, amid a recession that saw Boeing’s employment fall from 100,800 employees in 1967 to a low of 38,690 in April 1971. The “Boeing bust” was infamously marked by a billboard near the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport that read, “Will the last person leaving SEATTLE -- Turn out the lights.”\\nAn updated model — the 747-400 series — arrived in the late 1980s and had much better timing, coinciding with the Asian economic boom of the early 1990s, Aboulafia said. He took a Cathay Pacific 747 from Los Angeles to Hong Kong as a twentysomething backpacker in 1991.\\n“Even people like me could go see Asia,” Aboulafia said. “Before, you had to stop for fuel in Alaska or Hawaii and it cost a lot more. This was a straight shot — and reasonably priced.”\\nDelta was the last U.S. airline to use the 747 for passenger flights, which ended in 2017, although some other international carriers continue to fly it, including the German airline Lufthansa.\\nLufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr recalled traveling in a 747 as a young exchange student and said that when he realized he’d be traveling to the West Coast of the U.S. for Tuesday’s event, there was only one way to go: riding first-class in the nose of a Lufthansa 747 from Frankfurt to San Francisco. He promised the crowd Lufthansa would keep flying the 747 for many years to come.\\n“We just love the airplane,” he said.\\nAtlas Air ordered four 747-8 freighters early last year, with the final one — emblazoned with an image of Joe Sutter, the engineer who oversaw the 747′s original design team — delivered Tuesday. Atlas CEO John Dietrich called the 747 the greatest air freighter, thanks in part to its unique capacity to load through the nose cone.\\n',\n",

We need to act,” Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said in the Latvian capital of Riga at a news conference with his Baltic and Polish colleagues. Those countries, which lie on NATO’s eastern flank, feel especially threatened by Russia and have been the leading advocates for providing military aid.\\nUkrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov held talks with his French counterpart, saying they did not discuss specific fighter jets, but they did talk about aviation “platforms” to help Ukraine’s ground-to-air defense.\\n“I don’t know how quick it will be, this response from Western allies” to Kyiv’s requests for fighter jets, Reznikov said. “I’m optimistic and I think it will be as soon as possible.”\\nHe also listed weapons Ukraine has sought in the past year, starting with Stingers, and said the first response was always, “Impossible.” Eventually though, he said, “it became possible.’’\\nFrench Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, speaking with Reznikov, said there are “no taboos” on sending fighter jets. He also confirmed France is sending 12 more Caesar cannons in the coming weeks.\\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that France doesn’t exclude sending fighter jets but set out conditions before such a step is taken, including not leading to an escalation of tensions or using the aircraft “to touch Russian soil,” and not resulting in weakening “the capacities of the French army.”\\nReznikov’s trip came a week after Western nations pledged to send Kyiv sophisticated modern tanks.\\nSeveral Western leaders have expressed concern that providing warplanes could escalate the conflict and draw them in deeper.\\nThe U.K. government, among Kyiv’s staunchest supporters and military suppliers, said sending its fighter jets is “not practical.” Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s spokesman, Max Blain, said Tuesday that “the U.K.’s Typhoon and F-35 fighter jets are extremely sophisticated and take months to learn how to fly,” although he didn’t say London was opposed to other nations sending planes.\\nAsked Monday if his administration was considering sending F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, U.S. President Joe Biden responded, “No.”\\nOn Tuesday, Reznikov was asked if Biden’s ’’no” to F-16s was the final word.\\n“All types of help first passed through the ‘no’ stage,” he said. “Which only means ‘no’ at today’s given moment. The second stage is, ‘Let’s talk and study technical possibilities.’ The third stage is, ‘Let’s get your personnel trained.’ And the fourth stage is the transfer (of equipment).”\\nReznikov said Ukraine went through those stages before it got the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, the Bradley armored vehicles and 155mm artillery.\\n“Remember the story of the German Leopards -- the answer was also ‘no,’” he added. “And now we have a tank coalition. Therefore I believe an airplane coalition is within reach. But first there should always be a leader. And that’s why I’m here.”\\nKyiv has repeatedly urged allies to send jets, callling them essential to challenging Russia’s air superiority and to ensure the success of future counteroffensives spearheaded by Western tanks.\\nThe West also has ruled out providing Kyiv with long-range missiles able to hit Russian territory, citing potential escalation.\\nAfter months of haggling, Western allies agreed last week to send the tanks, despite the hesitation and caution of some NATO members.\\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz appeared to balk at providing fighter jets, suggesting Sunday the reason for the discussion might be “domestic political motives” in some countries.\\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said Monday there are “no taboos” in efforts to help Ukraine but added that jets “would be a very big next step.”\\nAsked Tuesday about Western weapons supplies to Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov repeated the Kremlin’s view that “NATO long has been directly involved into a hybrid war against Russia.”\\nFollowing talks in Moscow with Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry, he said the Russian military will “take all the necessary measures to derail the fulfillment of Western plans.”\\nHe said Shoukry conveyed a message from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken about Ukraine, which repeated calls from Washington for Russia to withdraw. Lavrov said “Russia is ready to hear any serious — I want to underline this word — proposal aimed at comprehensive settlement of the current situation.”\\nBoth Ukraine and Russia are believed to be building up their arsenals for an expected offensive in the coming months after the war being deadlocked on the battlefield during winter.\\nAsked about Lithuania’s call for fighter jets and long-range missiles for Ukraine, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the comments “reflected an aggressive approach taken by the Baltic nations and Poland, who are ready to do everything to provoke further escalation without thinking about consequences.”\\nCroatia President Zoran Milanovic, meanwhile, criticized Western nations for supplying Ukraine with tanks and other weapons, arguing those deliveries will only prolong the war.\\nEarly in the conflict, discussions focused on possibly providing Kyiv with Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter jets that Ukrainian pilots are familiar with. In March, the Pentagon rejected Poland’s proposal to transfer its MiG-29s to Kyiv through a U.S. base in Germany, citing a risk of triggering a Russia-NATO escalation.\\nUkraine inherited a significant fleet of Soviet-made warplanes, including Su-27 and MiG-29 fighter jets and Su-25 ground attack aircraft. Switching to Western aircraft would require Ukrainian crews to undergo long training and raise logistical challenges over maintenance and repair.\\nRussia methodically targeted Ukrainian air bases and air defense batteries in the opening stage of the war, but Ukraine has relocated its warplanes and concealed air defense assets, resulting in Moscow’s failure to gain full control of the skies.\\nAfter suffering early, heavy losses, the Russian air force has avoided venturing deep into Ukraine’s airspace and mostly focused on close support missions along the front line.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFormer Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has filed a request for a six-month visitor visa to stay in the U.S., indicating he may have no immediate intention of returning home, where legal issues await.\\nThe application was first reported by The Financial Times, citing Bolsonaro’s immigration lawyer, Felipe Alexandre. Contacted by The Associated Press, the lawyer’s firm, AG Immigration, confirmed the report.\\nBolsonaro left Brazil for Florida on Dec. 30, two days before the inauguration of his leftist rival, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The ceremony proceeded without incident, but a week later thousands of Bolsonaro’s die-hard supporters stormed the capital and trashed the top government buildings demanding that Lula’s election be overturned.\\nBolsonaro is being investigated for whether he had any role in inciting that uprising. It is just one of several probes targeting the former president and that pose a legal headache upon his eventual homecoming, and which could strip him of his eligibility in future races — or worse.\\nFor the first time in his more than three-decade political career as a lawmaker then as president, he no longer enjoys the special legal protection that requires any trial be held at the Supreme Court.\\nIt has been widely assumed — though not confirmed — that Bolsonaro entered the U.S. on an A-1 visa reserved for sitting heads of state. If so, he would have 30 days from the end of his presidential term to either leave the U.S. or adjust his status with the Department of Homeland Security.\\nMeantime, the shape of his political future and his potential return to Brazil has been a matter of rumor and speculation.\\nBolsonaro’s calculus appears to be to distance himself from the radicals whose destruction in the capital could implicate him in the short term, with the aim of some day returning to lead the opposition, said Mario Sérgio Lima, a political analyst at Medley Advisors.\\n“He is giving it some time, staying away a bit from the country at a moment when he can begin to suffer legal consequences for his supporters’ attitudes,” said Lima. “I don’t think the fact of him staying away is enough. The processes will continue, but maybe he thinks he can at least avoid some sort of revenge punishment.”\\nBolsonaro has been staying in a home outside Orlando, Florida, and video has shown him snapping photos with supporters in the gated community and ambling around inside a supermarket.\\nIn the wake of the rampage in the Brazilian capital this month, a group of 46 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter to President Joe Biden demanding Bolsonaro’s visa be revoked.\\n“The United States must not provide shelter for him, or any authoritarian who has inspired such violence against democratic institutions,” they wrote.\\nBolsonaro’s son, a senator, told reporters at an event this weekend that he was not sure when his father would return to Brazil.\\n“It could be tomorrow, it could be in six months, he might never return. I don’t know. He’s relaxing,” Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro said.\\nAsked whether Bolsonaro has filed any request for documentation or help with visa processses, Brazil’s foreign ministry referred AP to U.S. authorities. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services referred AP to the State Department, which has repeatedly declined comment to questions about Bolsonaro’s visa status in the U.S.\\n',\n",

We must show (our partners) the real picture of this war,” Podolyak said, without naming specific countries. “We must speak reasonably and tell them, for example, ‘This and this will reduce fatalities, this will reduce the burden on infrastructure. This will reduce security threats to the European continent, this will keep the war localized.’ And we are doing it.”\\nThe U.S. and Germany agreed Wednesday to share advanced tanks with Ukraine along with the Bradley and Marder vehicles promised earlier, a decision that led to criticism not only from the Kremlin but from the prime minister of NATO and European Union member Hungary.\\nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban asserted Friday that Western countries providing weapons and money to assist Ukraine in its war with Russia have “drifted” into becoming active participants in the conflict. Orban has refused to send weapons to neighboring Ukraine and sought to block EU funds earmarked for military aid.\\nThe Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said it would summon Hungary’s ambassador to complain about Orban’s remarks.

It was the deadliest attack on Israelis in years and raised the likelihood of more bloodshed.\\nThe attack, which occurred as residents were observing the Jewish sabbath, came a day after an Israeli military raid killed nine Palestinians in the West Bank. Friday’s shooting set off celebrations in both the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where people fired guns into the air, honked horns and distributed sweets.\\nThe burst of violence, which also included a rocket barrage from Gaza and retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, has posed an early challenge for Israel’s new government, which is dominated by ultranationalists who have pushed for a hard line against Palestinian violence. It also cast a cloud over a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to the region Sunday.\\nAddressing reporters at Israel’s national police headquarters, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had held a security assessment and decided on “immediate actions.” He said he would convene his Security Cabinet on Saturday night, after the end of the sabbath, to discuss a further response.\\nNetanyahu declined to elaborate but said Israel would act with “determination and composure.” He called on the public not to take the law into their own hands.\\nWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the U.S. strongly condemned the attack and was “shocked and saddened by the loss of life,” noting it came on International Holocaust Remembrance Day.\\nU.S. officials said later Friday that President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu to offer U.S. support to the government and people of Israel, calling the shootings “an attack against the civilized world.” “The President stressed the iron-clad U.S. commitment to Israel’s security,” the White House said of the call.\\nIsraeli police said the shootings occurred in Neve Yaakov, a settlement with a large ultra-Orthodox population, and that the gunman fled in a car. Police said they chased after him and after an exchange of fire, killed him.\\nJerusalem police chief Doron Turjeman confirmed seven deaths, in addition to the shooter, and said three people were wounded.\\nPolice identified the attacker as a 21-year-old east Jerusalem resident who apparently acted alone. Turjeman promised an “aggressive and significant” effort to track down anyone who helped him.\\nPolice also released a photo of the pistol it said was used by the attacker.\\nDefense Minister Yoav Gallant huddled with Israel’s military chief and other top security officials and instructed them to assist police and strengthen defenses near Jerusalem and for Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.\\n“Israel’s defense establishment will operate decisively and forcefully against terror and will reach anyone involved in the attack,” Gallant said.\\nIsrael’s MADA rescue service said that those killed included five men and two women, among them several who were 60 or older. Jerusalem’s Hadassah Hospital said a 15-year-old boy was recovering from surgery.\\nThe attack was the deadliest on Israelis since a 2008 shooting killed eight people in a Jewish seminary in Jerusalem, according to the Foreign Ministry. Given the location and timing, it threatened to trigger a tough response from Israel.\\nOvernight Thursday, Gaza militants fired several rockets into southern Israel, with all of them either intercepted or landing in open areas. Israel responded with airstrikes on targets in Gaza. No casualties were reported, and calm had appeared to be taking hold before Friday night’s shooting.\\nThere was no immediate claim of responsibility. In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, spokesman for the ruling Hamas militant group, said the attack was “a revenge and natural response” to the deadly military raid Thursday.\\nAt several locations across the Gaza Strip, dozens of Palestinians gathered in spontaneous demonstrations to celebrate the Jerusalem attack, with some coming out of dessert shops with large trays of sweets to distribute.\\nIn downtown Gaza City, celebratory gunfire could be heard, as cars honked and calls of “God is great!” wafted from mosque loudspeakers. In various West Bank towns, Palestinians launched fireworks.\\nThe attack escalated tensions that were already heightened following Thursday’s raid in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin, where nine people, including at least seven militants and a 61-year-old woman, were killed. It was the deadliest single raid in the West Bank in two decades. A 10th Palestinian was killed in separate fighting near Jerusalem.\\nAngry Palestinians marched Friday as they buried the last of those killed a day earlier.\\nScuffles between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters erupted after the funeral for a 22-year-old Palestinian north of Jerusalem and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank, but calm prevailed in the contested capital and in the blockaded Gaza Strip for most of the day.\\nThat suddenly dissolved with the east Jerusalem shooting, described as “horrific and heartbreaking” by Yair Lapid, the opposition leader and former prime minister.\\nNeve Yaakov is a religious Jewish settlement that Israel considers to be a neighborhood of its capital. Israel claims all of Jerusalem as its undivided capital, while the Palestinians seek east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, as a capital of their future state.\\nBlinken’s trip will probably now focus heavily on lowering tensions. He is likely to discuss the underlying causes of the conflict, the agenda of Israel’s new far-right government and the Palestinian Authority’s decision to halt security coordination with Israel in response to the Jenin raid.\\nThe Biden administration has been deeply engaged with Israeli and Palestinian leaders in recent days, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said, underscoring the “urgent need here for all parties to deescalate to prevent the further loss of civilian life and to work together to improve the security situation in the West Bank.”\\nIsrael and Hamas have fought four wars and several smaller skirmishes since the militant group seized power in Gaza from rival forces in 2007.\\nTensions have soared since Israel stepped up raids in the West Bank last spring, following a series of Palestinian attacks.\\nNearly 150 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and east Jerusalem in 2022, making it the deadliest year in those territories since 2004, according to leading Israeli rights group B’Tselem. Last year, 30 people were killed in Palestinian attacks against Israelis.\\nSo far this year, 30 Palestinians have been killed, according to a count by The Associated Press.\\nIsrael says most of the dead were militants. But youths protesting the incursions and others not involved in the confrontations also have been killed.\\nIsrael says its raids are meant to dismantle militant networks and thwart attacks.

Office on Drugs and Crime.\\n“Economic, security and governance disruptions that followed the military takeover of February 2021 have converged, and farmers in remote, often conflict-prone areas in northern Shan and border states have had little option but to move back to opium,” said the U.N. office’s regional representative Jeremy Douglas.\\nThe overall value of the Myanmar opiate economy, based on U.N. estimates, ranges between $660 million and $2 billion, depending on how much was sold locally, and how much of the raw opium was processed into heroin or other drugs.\\n“Virtually all the heroin reported in East and Southeast Asia and Australia originates in Myanmar, and the country remains the second-largest opium and heroin producer in the world after Afghanistan,” Douglas said. “There is no comparing the two at this point as Afghanistan still produces far more, but the expansion underway in Myanmar should not be dismissed and needs attention as it will likely continue — it is directly tied to the security and economic situation we see unfolding today.”\\nThe so-called Golden Triangle area, where the borders of Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet, has historically been a major production area for opium and hosted many of the labs that converted it to heroin. Decades of political instability have made the frontier regions of Myanmar, also known as Burma, largely lawless, to be exploited by drug producers and traffickers.\\nMost of the opium exported by Myanmar goes to China and Vietnam, while heroin goes to many countries across the region, Douglas said.\\n“It is really where the value is for traffickers,” he said. “Very high profits.”\\nThe cultivation of opium had been trending downward in recent years before the military took control of the government in 2021.\\nProduction estimates hit a bottom of 400 metric tons (440 tons) in 2020. After rising slightly in 2021, that spiked in 2022 to an estimated 790 metric tons (870 tons), according to the report.\\nSince it took control of the government, the military’s use of deadly force to hold on to power has escalated conflict with its civilian opponents to the point that some experts describe the country as now being in a state of civil war.\\nThe costs have been high, with 2,810 people killed by government forces to date and 17,427 detained, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.\\nThe violence has meant that the government has been unable to reach some areas to carry out drug eradication raids, and has also had to divert its resources elsewhere. Consequently, eradication efforts appear to have decreased substantially, with 1,403 hectares (3,467 acres) reported eradicated in 2022 — some 70% fewer than in 2021.\\nAt the same time, as the conflict continues to take its toll on Myanmar’s economy, an increasing number of rural households have been pushed into relying more on opium cultivation for income, the U.N. said.\\n“The expansion of opium production that is underway is fundamentally about poverty and people in rural areas reacting to the economic situation,” Douglas said. “It has always been there in tough times. At the same time, the security situation is clearly difficult with increasing frequency and intensity of conflict, and those involved in the drug economy have been left largely unchecked.”\\nIts synthetic drug economy has also been surging for the same reasons, with reported regional seizures of methamphetamine and other drugs reaching record levels. In a single bust in September in Laos, for example, authorities seized 33 million methamphetamine tablets along with 500 kilograms (1,100 pounds) of crystal methamphetamine.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFrom Washington to Berlin to Kyiv, a Western decision to send battle tanks to Ukraine was hailed enthusiastically. Moscow sought to downplay it.\\nThe Kremlin has previously warned that such tank deliveries would be a dangerous escalation of the conflict in Ukraine, and it has strongly denounced the watershed move by Germany and the United States to send the heavy weaponry to its foe.\\nBut it insists the new armor won’t stop Russia from achieving its goals in Ukraine.\\n“The potential it gives to the Ukrainian armed forces is clearly exaggerated,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. “Those tanks will burn just like any others.”\\nMoscow played down the move in an apparent attempt to save face as the West raised the stakes in Ukraine. Some Russian experts also emphasized that the supply of the deadly armor will be relatively limited and could take months to reach the front.\\nOn Thursday, Russia launched a new wave of missile and self-exploding drone attacks across Ukraine. The attack initially appeared to be a continuation of previous attacks rather than retaliation for the announcements on the tanks.\\nPresident Vladimir Putin, his diplomats and military leaders have repeatedly warned the West that supplying long-range weapons capable of striking deep inside Russia would mark a red line and trigger a massive retaliation.\\nWhile other weapons like tanks and certain air defense systems have drawn warnings from Russian officials, the wording has been deliberately vague, perhaps to allow the Kremlin to avoid getting cornered by making specific threats.\\nPoland, the Czech Republic and other NATO allies have provided Ukraine with hundreds of smaller Soviet-made tanks from the Cold War era when they were part of the Soviet bloc. Ukrainian armed forces, who have used similar aging weaponry, needed no extra training to use them. They played an important role on the battlefield, helping Ukraine reclaim broad swaths of territory in 11 months of fighting.\\nAs Ukraine’s armored units suffered attrition and stockpiles of the old T-72 tanks ran dry in the arsenals of its allies in Central and Eastern Europe, Kyiv has increasingly pushed for delivery of German-made Leopard 2 and U.S. M1 Abrams tanks.\\nAfter weeks of hesitation, Germany said Wednesday it will provide Ukraine with 14 Leopard 2 tanks and allow other allies willing to follow suit to deliver 88 Leopards to form two tank battalions. The U.S. announced it will send 31 M1 Abrams tanks.\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his officials, who long have said the country needs hundreds of tanks to counter a foe with a far superior number as well as other weapons, greeted the Western decision as a major breakthrough, voicing hope that more supplies will follow.\\n“The deliveries of Leopard 2 will take our ground forces to a qualitatively new level,” Ukrainian military expert Oleh Zhdanov told The Associated Press. Even though Leopard 2s are heavier than Soviet-designed tanks, they have a strong edge in firepower and survivability.\\n“One Leopard 2 could be equivalent to three or five Russian tanks,” Zhdanov said.\\nBut he noted that the promised number of Western tanks represents only the minimum that Ukraine needs to repel a likely offensive by Moscow, adding that Russia has thousands of armored vehicles.\\n“Kyiv is preparing for a defensive operation, and its outcome will determine the future course of the conflict,” Zhdanov said.\\nRussian military analysts were more skeptical about the Western tanks, arguing that while Abrams proved clearly superior to older models of Soviet-built tanks during the war in Iraq, newer Russian models are more closely matched. They also charged that Leopard 2 tanks used by the Turkish army against the Kurds in Syria proved vulnerable to Soviet-era anti-tank weapons.\\nSome Russian online media quickly posted diagrams of the vulnerable points of the Leopard 2. “Hit Leopard as your grandfather hit Tiger and Panther!” one headline said, referring to Nazi tanks in World War II.\\nAndrei Kartapolov, a retired general who heads the defense affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, argued that both Leopard 2 and Abrams are inferior to Russia’s T-90, a modified version of the T-72.\\nThe latest Russian tank, the T-14 Armata, has been manufactured only in small numbers and so far hasn’t been used in the war. The British Ministry of Defense said in its latest intelligence update that Russia has worked to prepare a small batch of T-14s for deployment in Ukraine, but said it had engine and other problems.\\nRussian observers, meanwhile, noted it could take a significant time for the Western tanks to reach Ukraine, adding that training Ukrainians to use them and properly maintain them would add to the challenge.\\n“It likely means that the Ukrainian military will probably receive a few small batches of tanks that could be incompatible with each other,” Moscow-based defense analyst Ilya Kramnik said in a commentary.\\nZhdanov, the Ukrainian military analyst, argued that by agreeing to provide Ukraine with tanks, the West crossed an important psychological barrier and could eventually follow up by supplying even more deadly weapons.\\n“Handing over Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine marks a major change in the policy of Western allies, who stopped fearing escalation and are now ready to challenge Russia in the war of resources,” he said. “The West is forced to more widely open the doors to its military arsenals to Ukraine.”\\nSpeaking in a video address late Wednesday, Zelenskyy hailed the creation of what he called a “tank coalition” and said Ukraine now will seek more artillery and push for unlocking supplies of long-range missiles and, ultimately, warplanes.\\nUkrainian officials long have expressed hope for getting U.S. F-16 fighter jets and long-range rockets for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, known as HIMARS, to hit targets far behind the front lines.\\nSuch desires drew ominous remarks from Russian diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov, similar to the kind voiced earlier by Putin and others.\\n“If Washington and NATO give Kyiv weapons to strike peaceful cities deep inside Russia and try to seize the territories that constitutionally belong to Russia, it will force Moscow to take harsh retaliatory action,” Gavrilov told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. “Don’t tell us then that we haven’t warned you.”\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nPope Francis criticized laws that criminalize homosexuality as “unjust,” saying God loves all his children just as they are and called on Catholic bishops who support the laws to welcome LGBTQ people into the church.\\n“Being homosexual isn’t a crime,” Francis said during an exclusive interview Tuesday with The Associated Press.\\nFrancis acknowledged that Catholic bishops in some parts of the world support laws that criminalize homosexuality or discriminate against LGBTQ people, and he himself referred to the issue in terms of “sin.” But he attributed such attitudes to cultural backgrounds, and said bishops in particular need to undergo a process of change to recognize the dignity of everyone.\\n“These bishops have to have a process of conversion,” he said, adding that they should apply “tenderness, please, as God has for each one of us.”\\nFrancis’ comments, which were hailed by gay rights advocates as a milestone, are the first uttered by a pope about such laws. But they are also consistent with his overall approach to LGBTQ people and belief that the Catholic Church should welcome everyone and not discriminate.\\nSome 67 countries or jurisdictions worldwide criminalize consensual same-sex sexual activity, 11 of which can or do impose the death penalty, according to The Human Dignity Trust, which works to end such laws. Experts say even where the laws are not enforced, they contribute to harassment, stigmatization and violence against LGBTQ people.\\nIn the U.S., more than a dozen states still have anti-sodomy laws on the books, despite a 2003 Supreme Court ruling declaring them unconstitutional. Gay rights advocates say the antiquated laws are used to justify harassment, and point to new legislation, such as the “Don’t say gay” law in Florida, which forbids instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade, as evidence of continued efforts to marginalize LGBTQ people.\\nThe United Nations has repeatedly called for an end to laws criminalizing homosexuality outright, saying they violate rights to privacy and freedom from discrimination and are a breach of countries’ obligations under international law to protect the human rights of all people, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.\\nDeclaring such laws “unjust,” Francis said the Catholic Church can and should work to put an end to them. “It must do this. It must do this,” he said.\\nFrancis quoted the Catechism of the Catholic Church in saying gay people must be welcomed and respected, and should not be marginalized or discriminated against.\\n“We are all children of God, and God loves us as we are and for the strength that each of us fights for our dignity,” Francis said, speaking to the AP in the Vatican hotel where he lives.\\nFrancis’ remarks come ahead of a trip to Africa, where such laws are common, as they are in the Middle East. Many date from British colonial times or are inspired by Islamic law. Some Catholic bishops have strongly upheld them as consistent with Vatican teaching, while others have called for them to be overturned as a violation of basic human dignity.\\nIn 2019, Francis had been expected to issue a statement opposing criminalization of homosexuality during a meeting with human rights groups that conducted research into the effects of such laws and so-called “conversion therapies.”\\nIn the end, after word of the audience leaked, the pope didn’t meet with the groups. Instead, the Vatican No. 2 did and reaffirmed “the dignity of every human person and against every form of violence.”\\nThere was no indication that Francis spoke out about such laws now because his more conservative predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, recently died. The issue had never been raised in an interview, but Francis willingly responded, citing even the statistics about the number of countries where homosexuality is criminalized.\\nOn Tuesday, Francis said there needed to be a distinction between a crime and a sin with regard to homosexuality. Church teaching holds that homosexual acts are sinful, or “intrinsically disordered,” but that gay people must be treated with dignity and respect.\\nBantering with himself, Francis articulated the position: “It’s not a crime. Yes, but it’s a sin. Fine, but first let’s distinguish between a sin and a crime.”\\n“It’s also a sin to lack charity with one another,” he added.\\nFrancis has not changed the church’s teaching, which has long riled gay Catholics. But he has made reaching out to LGBTQ people a hallmark of his papacy.\\nThe pope’s comments didn’t specifically address transgender or nonbinary people, just homosexuality, but advocates of greater LGBTQ inclusion in the Catholic Church hailed the pope’s comments as a momentous advance.\\n“His historic statement should send a message to world leaders and millions of Catholics around the world: LGBTQ people deserve to live in a world without violence and condemnation, and more kindness and understanding,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the U.S.-based advocacy group GLAAD.\\nNew Ways Ministry, a Catholic LGBTQ advocacy group, said the church hierarchy’s silence on such laws until now had had devastating effects, perpetuating such policies and fueling violent rhetoric against LGBTQ people.\\n“The pope is reminding the church that the way people treat one another in the social world is of much greater moral importance than what people may possibly do in the privacy of a bedroom,” the group’s executive director, Francis DeBernardo, said in a statement.\\nOne of the cardinals recently appointed by the pope – Robert McElroy, the bishop of San Diego -- is among those Catholics who would like the church to go further, and fully welcome LGBTQ people into the church even if they are sexually active.\\n“It is a demonic mystery of the human soul why so many men and women have a profound and visceral animus toward members of the L.G.B.T. communities,” McElroy wrote Tuesday in the Jesuit magazine America. “The church’s primary witness in the face of this bigotry must be one of embrace rather than distance or condemnation.”\\nStarting with his famous 2013 declaration, “Who am I to judge?” — when he was asked about a purportedly gay priest — Francis has gone on to minister repeatedly and publicly to the gay and transgender communities. As archbishop of Buenos Aires, he favored granting legal protections to same-sex couples as an alternative to endorsing gay marriage, which Catholic doctrine forbids.\\nDespite such outreach, Francis was criticized by the Catholic gay community for a 2021 decree from the Vatican’s doctrine office that said the church cannot bless same-sex unions.\\nIn 2008, the Vatican declined to sign onto a U.N. declaration that called for the decriminalization of homosexuality, complaining the text went beyond the original scope. In a statement at the time, the Vatican urged countries to avoid “unjust discrimination” against gay people and end penalties against them.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nFinland’s foreign minister suggested Tuesday that the country may consider joining NATO without neighboring Sweden if Turkey continues to block their joint bid to enter the military alliance.\\nPekka Haavisto later backpedaled, but his comments were the first time a leading government official in either Nordic country appeared to raise doubts about becoming NATO members together at a time when the alliance is seeking to present a united front in the face of Russia’s war in Ukraine.\\nSweden and Finland rushed to apply for NATO membership following Moscow’s invasion, abandoning their long-standing non-alignment policy. Their accession needs the approval of all existing NATO members, including Turkey, which has so far blocked the expansion, saying Sweden in particular needs to crack down on exiled Kurdish militants and their sympathizers.\\nOn Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned Sweden again not to expect support for its application following weekend protests in Stockholm by an anti-Islam activist and pro-Kurdish groups.\\nAsked a day later whether it still made sense for Finland to proceed together with the Swedes, Haavisto told broadcaster YLE that his country would have to “evaluate the situation if it turns out that Sweden’s application is stalling for a long time to come.”\\nHaavisto later told reporters in Parliament that his comment was “imprecise” and that Finland’s ambition to enter NATO jointly with Sweden remained unchanged.\\nHe said he had spoken with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who had stressed to Haavisto that the military bloc would like to see the two nations join simultaneously.\\n“But of course there have been raised concerns within NATO on how the (recent) incidents in Sweden will affect the schedule,” Haavisto said.\\nUntil now, Sweden and Finland had been committed to joining the alliance together.\\n“This is the first crack in the so far rather impressive unity between Sweden and Finland,” said Paul Levin, director of the Institute for Turkish Studies at Stockholm University. “Finland is currently somewhat of an innocent victim of the continued provocations by Swedish groups critical of NATO accession, protected by the very liberal Swedish freedom of speech laws. If Turkey persists in blocking accession, I suspect that Finland will at some point have to go it alone.”\\nMatti Pesu, a researcher at the Finnish Institute of International Affairs, said Haavisto’s comment was “the first public signal that there is a Plan B if the Swedish NATO membership bid freezes for a longer time.”\\nHe stressed that Finland still prioritizes joining the alliance together with Sweden.\\n“Finland should consider other alternatives only if there was a serious possibility of a significant delay in Sweden’s NATO bid and only if NATO allies welcomed Finland’s entry without Sweden,” he said.\\nSwedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said he “understands the frustration that many in Finland feel” over not having been admitted to the alliance already, but called for calm and urged Swedes who oppose NATO membership to “realize the gravity” of the security situation.\\n“There are forces both in Sweden and outside Sweden who want to prevent Sweden from becoming a NATO member,” he told reporters in Stockholm. “And it’s against that backdrop we should see that there are provocateurs who want to damage Sweden’s relations to other countries, leading to a delay in Swedish membership of NATO.”\\nIn a memorandum of understanding signed by the three countries at a NATO summit last year, Sweden and Finland committed not to support Kurdish militant groups and to lift arms embargos on Turkey imposed after its incursion into northern Syria in 2019.\\nPro-Kurdish and anti-Turkish demonstrations in Stockholm have complicated the process. On Saturday, a far-right activist from Denmark staged a protest outside the Turkish Embassy in Stockholm where he burned the Quran, Islam’s holy book. A separate pro-Kurdish demonstration was held later Saturday in the Swedish capital.\\nThe Swedish government has tried to distance itself from the demonstrations, while insisting that such protests are protected by freedom of speech.\\n“It is completely legal to provoke if one wants to. But it can also have consequences,” Kristersson said.\\nTurkey responded angrily to the protests, canceling a planned visit to Ankara by the Swedish defense minister. Protests were held outside Swedish diplomatic missions in Turkey, prompting the Swedish embassy in Ankara to close its doors to the public on Tuesday.\\nErdogan slammed Swedish authorities for allowing the Quran-burning demonstration.\\n“It is clear that those who allowed such vileness to take place in front of our embassy can no longer expect any charity from us regarding their NATO membership application,” he said.\\nHe also criticized the pro-Kurdish demonstration, accusing Sweden of letting “terror organizations run wild on your avenues and streets.” He said that if Sweden won’t show respect to Turkey or Muslims, then “they won’t see any support from us on the NATO issue.\\nFinnish President Sauli Niinistö, who visited Ukraine on Tuesday, said he didn’t expect any progress on the issue before the Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections set to be held on May 14.\\nTurkey and Hungary are the only NATO members that have yet to ratify Finland and Sweden’s accession.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nThe US Justice Department and eight states filed an antitrust suit against Google on Tuesday, seeking to shatter its alleged monopoly on the entire ecosystem of online advertising as a hurtful burden to advertisers, consumers and even the U.S. government.\\nThe government alleged in the complaint that Google is looking to “neutralize or eliminate” rivals in the online ad marketplace through acquisitions and to force advertisers to use its products by making it difficult to use competitors’ offerings. It’s part of a new, if slow and halting, push by the U.S. to rein in big tech companies that have enjoyed largely unbridled growth in the past decade and a half.\\n“Monopolies threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation, they hurt producers and workers, and they increase costs for consumers,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said at a news conference Tuesday.\\nFor 15 years, Garland said, Google has “pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct” that has stalled the rise of rival technologies and manipulated the mechanics of online ad auctions to force advertisers and publishers to use its tools. In so doing, he added, Google ”engaged in exclusionary conduct” that has “severely weakened,” if not destroyed, competition in the ad tech industry.\\nThe suit, the latest legal action brought by the government against Google, accuses the company of unlawfully monopolizing the way ads are served online by excluding competitors. Google’s ad manager lets large publishers who have significant direct sales manage their advertisements. The ad exchange, meanwhile, is a real-time marketplace to buy and sell online display ads.\\nGarland said Google controls the technology used by most major website publishers to offer advertising space for sale, as well as the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together when ad space is sold. The result, he added, is that “website creators earn less and advertisers pay more.”\\nThe lawsuit, filed in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, demands that Google divest itself of the businesses of buyer, seller and auctioneer of digital display advertising, remaining with search — its core business — and other products and services including YouTube, Gmail and cloud services.\\nDigital ads currently account for about 80% of Google’s revenue, and by and large support its other, less lucrative endeavors. But the company, along with Facebook’s parent company, Meta, has seen its market share decline in recent years as smaller rivals grab bigger portions of the online advertising market. Beyond that, the overall online ads environment market is cooling off as advertisers clamp down on spending and brace for a potential recession.\\nAlphabet Inc., Google’s parent company, said in a statement that the suit “doubles down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.”\\nTuesday’s lawsuit comes as the U.S. government is increasingly looking to rein in Big Tech’s dominance, although such legal action can take years to complete and Congress has not passed any recent legislation seeking to curb the influence of the tech industry’s largest players.\\nThe European Union has been more active. It launched an antitrust investigation into Google’s digital ad dominance in 2021. British and European regulators are also looking into whether an agreement for online display advertising services between Google and Meta breached rules on fair competition.\\nAn internet services trade group that includes Google as a member described the lawsuit and its “radical structural remedies” as unjustified.\\nMatt Schruers, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, said competition for advertising is fierce and the “governments’ contention that digital ads aren’t in competition with print, broadcast, and outdoor advertising defies reason.”\\nDina Srinivasan, a Yale University fellow and adtech expert, said the lawsuit is “huge” because it aligns the entire nation — state and federal governments — in a bipartisan legal offensive against Google.\\nThe current online ad market, Srinivasan said, “is broken and totally inefficient.” The fact that intermediaries are getting 30% to 50% of the take on each ad trade is “an insane inefficiency to have baked into the U.S. economy.” She called it “a massive tax on the free internet and consumers at large. It directly affects the viability of a free press” as well.\\nAs with many highly complex technical markets, it has taken time for federal and state regulators and policymakers to catch up with and understand the online ad market. Srinivasan noted that it took a decade before they woke up to the perils of high-speed trading in financial markets and began adopting measures to discourage it.\\nGoogle held nearly 29% of the U.S. digital advertising market — it includes all the ads people see on computers. phones, tablets and other internet-connected devices — in 2022, according to research firm Insider Intelligence. Facebook parent company Meta is second, commanding nearly 20% of the market. Amazon is a distant, but growing, third at more than 11%.\\nInsider is estimating that both Google and Meta’s share of the ad market will decline, while rivals such as Amazon and TikTok are expected to see gains.\\nThis is the latest legal action taken against Google by either the Justice Department or local state governments. In October 2020, for instance, the Trump administration and 11 state attorneys general sued Google for violating antitrust laws, alleging anticompetitive practices in the search and search advertising markets.\\nAsked why the Justice Department would bring the suit when a similar complaint has already been filed by states, Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, the department’s top antitrust official, said, “We conducted our own investigation, and that investigation occurred over many years.”\\nTuesday’s lawsuit in essence aligns the Biden administration and new states with the 35 states and District of Colombia that sued Google in December 2020 over the exact same issues.\\nThe states taking part in the suit include California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Tennessee.\\n',\n",

But Polish officials took heart from remarks Sunday by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock that Berlin wouldn’t seek to stop Poland from providing Leopard 2 battle tanks.\\nPolish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki didn’t specify when the request to Germany will be made. He said that Poland is building a coalition of nations ready to send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine.\\nPoland needs the consent of Germany, which builds the tanks, to send them to a non-NATO country.\\nBut even if Germany doesn’t grant permission, Warsaw will make its own decisions, Morawiecki said at a news conference.\\nUkraine says tanks -- and especially the Leopards -- are vital to its war effort. Both sides’ battlefield positions are mostly deadlocked during winter, with new ground offensives expected in the spring. Russia’s forces are much larger than Ukraine’s, so Kyiv wants to gain an advantage in weaponry and fuller backing from its Western allies.\\nPoland has become a leading advocate in the European Union for giving military aid to help Ukraine prevail 11 months after the Kremlin’s forces invaded. Germany’s hesitation has drawn criticism, particularly from Poland and the Baltic countries on NATO’s eastern flank that feel especially threatened by Russia.\\nAlthough Berlin has provided substantial aid, it has been criticized for dragging its feet on providing military hardware.\\nGerman government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said it was important for Germany not to take a “reckless” step it might regret, adding that a decision will not be rushed.\\n“These are hard questions of life and death,” he added. “We have to ask what this means for the defense of our own country.”\\nPressed on how long a decision on sending tanks might take, Hebestreit said: “I assume that it’s not a question of months now.”\\nPreviously, Polish officials have indicated that Finland and Denmark were ready to join Warsaw in sending Leopards to Ukraine. The United Kingdom has pledged to send Challenger tanks. French President Emmanuel Macron said Sunday he asked his defense minister to “work on” the possibility of sending Leclerc battle tanks to Ukraine.\\nBut Macron said a decision hinged on three criteria that have also weighed on the minds of other Western leaders: that sharing the equipment doesn’t lead to an escalation of the conflict; that it would provide efficient and workable help when training time is taken into account; and that it wouldn’t weaken his own military.\\nMorawiecki said that while Poland intends to ask Germany for permission to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, the request is “a secondary matter” as a group of EU countries look at how to help Kyiv.\\n“Naturally, these are not easy talks, but we will be taking efforts to break this barrier of unwillingness in various countries,” he said.\\nBaerbock, Germany’s top diplomat, told French television channel LCI on Sunday that Poland hasn’t formally asked for Berlin’s approval to share some of its Leopards, but added “if we were asked, we would not stand in the way.”\\nRegarding Baerbock’s comments, Morawiecki said that “exerting pressure makes sense” and that her words are a “spark of hope” that Germany may even take part in the coalition.\\nAccording to Morawiecki, Germany has “more than 350 active Leopards and about 200 in storage.”\\nPoland wants to send a company of Leopard tanks, which means 14 of them, but they would barely make an impression in a war that involves thousands of tanks. If other countries contribute, Warsaw reckons, the tank detachment could grow to a brigade size.\\nBerlin has shown caution at each step of increasing its aid to Ukraine, a hesitancy seen as rooted in its history and political culture.\\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the latest developments on Western Europe sending tanks to Ukraine “signaled increasing nervousness among members of the alliance.”\\nUkraine’s supporters pledged billions of dollars in military aid to Kyiv at a meeting Friday at Ramstein Air Base in Germany. International defense leaders discussed Ukraine’s urgent request for the Leopard 2 tanks, and the absence of an agreement overshadowed new military commitments.\\nIn Brussels, EU foreign ministers gave the green light Monday to a further 500 million euro ($543 million) package of military support for Ukraine, as well as funds to help pay for a training mission for the bloc has set up for the country’s troops.\\nThe money would be used to reimburse EU countries for weapons and ammunition they supply Ukraine. Another 45 million euros ($49 million) will pay for the 27-nation bloc’s military training mission this year.\\nIt brings the total amount of money provided to Ukraine from the EU fund to about 3.6 billion euros.\\nMoscow, in response to the pledges of sophisticated Western weapons for Kyiv’s military, has stepped up its warnings that escalation risks catastrophe.\\n“We have said on numerous occasions that escalation is the most dangerous path, and the consequences may be unpredictable,” Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said. “Our signals are not listened to, and Russia’s adversaries keep raising the stakes.”\\nThe Kremlin’s forces have kept up their bombardments of Ukrainian areas.\\nKharkiv Gov. Oleh Synyehubov said Russian forces shelled several towns and villages in the northeastern region in the previous 24 hours, killing a 67-year-old woman and leaving another resident wounded.\\nNeither side shows signs of backing down as the war heads for a second year.\\nThe Kremlin appears to be keeping its options open on mobilizing more soldiers.

However, some Russian lawyers and rights groups pointed out that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mobilization decree remains in effect until another presidential decree is issued to formally end the action.\\nPeskov said Monday although the assigned number of reservists have been mobilized, the decree remains in force because it also includes “other measures needed to ensure the fulfillment of tasks by the military.” He didn’t elaborate.\\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly warned that Russia’ plans to continue mobilizing more troops.\\n',\n",

A total of 13,248 people were killed during the armed conflict as per the Informal Sector Service Center even though the total number of deaths in the conflict is widely claimed to be 17,000. The state killed 7,905 persons and the Maoists 5,049, according to INSEC.\\nLegal experts say resolution to conflict-era cases cannot be found through regular court process as the Nepali state has already accepted the armed conflict as a political issue.\\nThey opine that Maoists need not be worried merely because petitions have been registered in the SC.\\nSenior advocate Sunil Pokharel said that the SC can order to initiate investigation of conflict-era cases through the petitions. “The SC has already ordered to formulate law to conclude transitional cases. It has also ordered that court hearing should be held in cases of murder, torture, forced disappearances and rapes. The SC can also order saying the defendants must be investigated. We have the precedence of an order given to initiate investigation against Maoist leader Agni Sapkota.” \\xa0\\nHe opined that the Maoists need not worry merely because of the order to register the petitions and the subsequent registration of petitions.\\nAnother senior advocate Tikaram Bhattarai also concurred. “The petitions have just been registered. It does not seem that the SC will immediately enter the subjects. There are two possibilities in the case. The first is it can be revoked prima facie. There can also be order to seek written response. It will then enter the long process of court case. The government and the House can pass the laws related to TRC by then. The SC may say it need not do anything saying it is under jurisdiction of the TRC if that happens.”\\nBhatarai said that the SC’s reasoning while ordering registration of the petitions that conflict-era cases cannot be stretched for eternity is appropriate. “The SC can order to initiate investigation of conflict-era incidents if the laws are not formulated to address that. But it cannot order to arrest (Dahal) through these petitions.\\nHe added that Maoist Center should take this SC order to register the petitions as an opportunity to formulate laws. “But I think Maoist Center has used this issue as a political weapon. I feel this is a political stunt to try to bring all those who have split from Maoist Center together and to continue the coalition with Nepali Congress pointing that the two parties not remaining together may cause trouble for them as one party represents the then rebels while the other headed the then government.” \\xa0\\nThe SC has been showing apt concern that the conflict-era cases cannot be stretched for eternity even in the past and it can again reiterate its concern. But Maoist Center has been portraying this issue as an attack against the CPA and the Constitution. \\xa0\\nThe Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons have been formed to resolve conflict-era cases but they have yet to start work in earnest due to lack of agreement among the political parties.\\nMaoist Center General Secretary Dev Gurung pointed that the issue cannot be resolved merely by initiation of one party, and trying to infringe on the jurisdiction of the transitional justice mechanism is against the spirit of the CPA and the Constitution.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\n“A patient wanted to buy antibiotics for a bruise. They want antibiotics even for influenza.” Indonesian pharmacists had alarming stories when researchers interviewed them about their experiences.\\nBut the story gets even more alarming: 2021 research shows that 70 percent of Indonesian pharmacies dispense antibiotics without a prescription. And many Indonesians who cannot afford appropriate health care buy prescription-only drugs, including antibiotics, in the informal sector for self-treatment.\\nIn Indonesia, licensed drug stores (which are different from pharmacies) often sell antibiotics, evading inspection by the authorities. The informal and formal sectors – licensed and unlicensed sellers, grocery stores and pharmacies – are entangled. The Indonesian distribution channels for medicines are said to be the most complicated in the world.\\nWhen prescription-only drugs are distributed without a prescription in pharmacies it seems that regulations don’t work. When they are distributed by unlicensed sellers, it shows there is a market beyond the reach of laws and regulations. Both are characteristics of a world in which low-quality drugs are prevalent. The question remains whether the problem can be solved simply by tightening regulations.\\nLow-quality generic drugs are a major challenge for low- and middle-income countries in two ways. First, the high availability of low-quality antimalarials and antibiotics in these countries seems to relate to demand: many consumers need these drugs. Second, the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa), an emerging group of low- and middle-income countries, need to develop their pharmaceutical business as an export industry.\\nA technological foundation is required to meet both these needs: satisfying local demand and succeeding as an export industry. Standards are a core element of this foundation. Pharmaceutical standards of efficacy and safety are driven by the need to protect human life. In other words, it is not possible to design pharmaceutical standards solely in terms of efficiency and convenience.\\nBut willingness to comply with standards is not the same as achieving them. Cost is the main obstacle here. All stakeholders in a society must be motivated (incentivised) to comply with the relevant standards. It is not enough simply to strengthen laws and regulations. Medicine quality depends on a social system where all stakeholders – including approval, manufacturing, distribution and marketing entities, as well as medical practitioners and patients – receive appropriate incentives and advantages.\\nThe public dispensary system in India is a social security system that benefits many poor people, but it is not a sound system in this respect. Officials have been caught taking bribes, and the bargaining process between suppliers and the government provides strong temptation for manufacturers to cut corners on production, making low-quality medicines to eke out greater profits.\\nBy contrast, the public health care service in Japan is a rare example of a system designed immediately after the Second World War that continues to operate extremely well. The medical service provided under the universal health insurance system is fair, reasonably inexpensive and of good quality for all. There is ample incentive for both providers and patients to use the services. For this reason, the problem of low-quality drugs in Japan is much smaller than in other countries.\\nWhere standards are lax and incentives to comply with them are few, there is ample room for malicious criminals. Even legitimate suppliers can find it difficult to avoid the temptation to cut costs and deviate from standards and regulations. In this way the market sees a mixture of counterfeit products made by criminals and low-quality drugs made by legitimate suppliers who fall short of specifications.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) International Medical Products Anti-Counterfeiting Taskforce (IMPACT), established in 2006, defined and sought to eradicate counterfeit medicines but was silent on substandard ones. This led to significant opposition from low- and middle-income countries.\\nLow and middle-income countries take the view that counterfeit drugs are different from substandard drugs. But the WHO’s definition did not make this distinction clear, and internationally the two types of low-quality medicine were mixed up. High-income countries such as the United States and Germany supported IMPACT and sought to protect their intellectual property rights against emerging countries. This added to the backlash from low- and middle-income countries.\\nIntellectual property rights are the largest barrier to converting innovative new drugs to generic drugs, and adding them to the WHO’s model list of essential medicines. Many of the medicines in the model list are generic drugs, among which substandard drugs have been prevalent in low- and middle-income countries.\\nWhen IMPACT was established, antiretrovirals to treat HIV (AIDS) were prime candidates for inclusion in the model list from a global public health point of view, but this challenged the international rules of intellectual property rights. The conflict between the two worlds – developed and developing economies – comes clearly into view here.\\nIMPACT failed because from the very beginning advanced economies and international organisations drove the process, leaving the interests of a range of countries behind. The WHO needed to change course.\\nTackling the proliferation of low-quality medicines is not merely a matter of enhancing pharmaceutical regulation, defining counterfeit medicines, and making technical improvements. It is also a question of international politics.\\nPublic health policy needs to look beyond the quality of medicines to the impoverishment of those who need them. Those who risk falling into poverty if they buy good-quality medicine are forced to make a choice between low-quality medicine and no medicine at all. Paradoxically, even low-quality drugs can be a saving grace for many in the informal sector. At the same time, intellectual monopoly rights are not only the rights of one company or one industry but also a source of economic growth for some countries.\\nHealth care is a scarce economic resource, and countries around the world are working to correct the uneven distribution of this resource. But the situation is not structurally uniform in all countries, and their external considerations are even more individualised. The gap between the ideal goals of regulation and the constraints of reality needs to be recognised.\\nThe problem of low-quality medicines has the same source as the problem of economic inequality among people. It needs to be addressed at the same fundamental level.\\n(Professor Yasuhide Nakamura is a professor emeritus of Osaka University, President of Friends of WHO Japan, and a senior fellow professor of the National College of Nursing at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Japan)\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nTwo new studies provide more evidence that the coronavirus pandemic originated in a Wuhan, China market where live animals were sold – further bolstering the theory that the virus emerged in the wild rather than escaping from a Chinese lab.\\nThe research, published online Tuesday by the journal Science, shows that the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market was likely the early epicenter of the scourge that has now killed nearly 6.4 million people around the world. Scientists conclude that the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, likely spilled from animals into people two separate times.\\n“All this evidence tells us the same thing: It points right to this particular market in the middle of Wuhan,” said Kristian Andersen a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research and coauthor of one of the studies. “I was quite convinced of the lab leak myself until we dove into this very carefully and looked at it much closer.”\\nIn one study, which incorporated data collected by Chinese scientists, University of Arizona evolutionary biologist Michael Worobey and his colleagues used mapping tools to estimate the locations of more than 150 of the earliest reported COVID-19 cases from December 2019. They also mapped cases from January and February 2020 using data from a social media app that had created a channel for people with COVID-19 to get help.\\nThey asked, “Of all the locations that the early cases could have lived, where did they live? And it turned out when we were able to look at this, there was this extraordinary pattern where the highest density of cases was both extremely near to and very centered on this market,” Worobey said at a press briefing. “Crucially, this applies both to all cases in December and also to cases with no known link to the market … And this is an indication that the virus started spreading in people who worked at the market but then started to spread into the local community.”\\nAndersen said they found case clusters inside the market, too, “and that clustering is very, very specifically in the parts of the market” where they now know people were selling wildlife, such as raccoon dogs, that are susceptible to infection with the coronavirus.\\nIn the other study, scientists analyzed the genomic diversity of the virus inside and outside of China starting with the earliest sample genomes in December 2019 and extending through mid-February 2020. They found that two lineages – A and B – marked the pandemic’s beginning in Wuhan. Study coauthor Joel Wertheim, a viral evolution expert at the University of California, San Diego, pointed out that lineage A is more genetically similar to bat coronaviruses, but lineage B appears to have begun spreading earlier in humans, particularly at the market.\\n“Now I realize it sounds like I just said that a once-in-a-generation event happened twice in short succession,” Wertheim said. But certain conditions were in place — such as people and animals in close proximity and a virus that can spread from animals to people and from person to person. So “barriers to spillover have been lowered such that multiple introductions, we believe, should actually be expected,” he said.\\n',\n",

It was preceded by the Tianzhou-class cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-14 crewed spacecraft.\\nChina’s space program is run by the ruling Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army, and has largely proceeded with the Tiangong program without other nations’ assistance. The U.S. excluded China from the International Space Station because of its military ties.\\nChina launched its first astronaut into orbit in 2003, making it only the third country to do so on its own after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. Its space program has landed robot rovers on the moon and placed one on Mars last year. China has also returned lunar samples and officials have discussed a possible crewed mission to the moon.\\n',\n",
       "  '\\nWhat is fire? Usually, it’s defined as the physical chemistry of combustion. The definition matters because it prescribes how we think about fire and what we do with it. If fire is a chemical reaction shaped by its physical surroundings, then we can deconstruct it into its constituent parts. Fuel plus oxygen plus spark equals fire. We can harness it, put it into machines, and contain it by physical countermeasures.\\nAnother perspective might be that fire results from life – biological processes create the oxygen and furnish the fuel. Fire takes apart what plants put together through photosynthesis. Fire’s chemistry is therefore a biochemistry.\\nFire depends on the living world to flourish, and facilitates a wide gamut of ecological effects. Perhaps fire is less like a Bunsen burner than it is a virus. Not alive, but dependent on life, it spreads as a contagion of combustion. Often thought of as a natural disaster, perhaps fire more emulates COVID-19 than a hurricane. If so, it responds to biological, not just physical, conditions.\\nThe fire-as-biology analogy is surprisingly robust. When ancestors of modern humans captured fire, it more resembled domestication than tool-making. Tamed fire is more a sheepdog than a torch. The allusion seems strange because we are so accustomed to imagining fire in strictly physical terms and because, while fire radiates metaphors, it rarely receives them. Fire is fire, elemental: other phenomena are compared to it, not it to others. A plague spreads like wildfire. We don’t hear that wildfire spreads like a plague.\\nWhere urban spaces meet the bush – the built environment most vulnerable to burning – protective strategies are similar for wildfire as for COVID. Clearing combustibles around structures is like practicing social distancing. Sealing houses against embers and direct contact is like wearing masks against aerosols and washing hands. Building firebreaks against spread – isolating the infected. Enough buildings shielded to limit damage from the unprotected ones achieves herd immunity.\\nFire plagues result from breakdowns in how people and the natural world interact. They emerge, like so many new viruses, from unbalanced environments, when natural reservoirs intersect with human meddling. The flames of wildfires are not so much wild as feral. Thinking about fire in physical terms informs how to halt a fire that is blowing-and-going, but it doesn’t explain how to manage fire on a long-term landscape scale. A strategy for living with fire would mend the ecological fractures on which fire feeds and substitute controlled fire for wild. When outbreaks occur, a biological strategy for fire might respond not only with physical counterfire but with analogues of public health measures like vaccines, quarantines, and disease-specific treatments.\\nPlenty of burning happens in the undeveloped world, and massive land-converting fires are a characteristic of developing countries (think Brazil and Indonesia). But uncontrolled conflagrations are a pathology of the developed world. Rich countries who are most committed to an understanding of fire that deconstructs it into simple combustion and puts it in machines are the ones that have the poorest fire ecology, experience the worst build-up of fuels, and contribute the most to climate change.\\nEarth first experienced fire when plants began to colonise continents. Fire and early life on Earth evolved together – call it first nature. Then human ancestors acquired the ability to systematically manipulate fire. Early people grew bigger brains and smaller digestive systems because they learned to cook their food. With this second fire as a catalyst, humans created a second nature. But it was one with internal checks and balances since burning was contained within living landscapes. Ever looking for more stuff to burn, people turned to lithic landscapes – once living, now fossilised plants – coal and oil. These burned in special combustion chambers, and they lacked ecological barriers and buffers; they could burn day and night, winter and summer, through wet and dry.\\nThe advent of third fire resulted from the dominance of the physical model in science and practice. And this unbounded combustion is unhinging the climate, acidifying oceans, and forcing living landscapes to reorganise. This third fire is remaking the planet, informed by fossil-fueled societies that are sublimating fire into electricity, replacing animals with machines, and rewiring geochemical cycles with plastics and petrochemicals.\\nThe third fire challenged the first two. Fossil fuel combustion offered an alternative source of heat and light. It powers machines to suppress fire. It creates landscapes such as cities and farms intended to exclude free-burning flame.\\nBut after a brief grace period, the three fires have begun colluding.\\nIt is as though the world of the ice ages has passed through the looking glass and ice is being replaced with fire. Everywhere fire-catalysed change is driving off the vestiges of ice. Instead of massive ice sheets, there are fire-shaped ecosystems; instead of glacial outwash plains, there are smoke palls; instead of permafrost, biochar. Sea level is changing. A mass extinction is underway. The signature of humanity, long inked in charcoal and now in plastic, is being written into the geological record. A fire age is replacing an ice age.\\nThe Earth has too much bad fire, too little good, and too much combustion overall. This is an artefact of humanity and how we imagine fire. We’ve treated it as a physical event that we can segregate from everything else like an axe or harness in a factory farm, rather than a process entwined with living landscapes and a companion on our journey. Fire may be our ecological signature, but it is not ours to do with as we please. Its power brings obligations.\\nDefinitions, it seems, matter.\\n(Stephen Pyne is a fire historian, urban farmer, and emeritus professor at Arizona State University, USA)\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nIndustry Minister Gajendra Hamal has resigned 40 hours after appointment. Hamal has said he has resigned listening to his conscience after widespread criticism of the appointment. Baluwatar has tried to spin the resignation by Hamal of his own volition to save its face. The press note issued by Baluwatar mentions that Hamal has resigned on request of Prime Minister (PM) Sher Bahadur Deuba even as audio recording of Hamal requesting to broadcast/publish the issue through the media pointing that Deuba may reject his resignation has been made public.\\nOne fact has been irrefutably established despite all the efforts of damage control by Baluwatar. The democracy in Nepal has been attacked in an unimaginable manner last week.\\nPoliticians and people in the judiciary can some time commit mistakes in course of work and do work that should not be done. But the deed of PM Deuba and Chief Justice (CJ) Cholendra Shumsher Rana with consent of the top leaders of ruling coalition is an unthinkable crime in democracy. CJ seeking share of spoils in the government and the ruling parties accepting that is unimaginable in democracy.\\nThe main source of this misdeed is CJ Rana, and his unconstitutional aspirations. Rana had the temerity to seek a share in power violating the sanctity of judiciary believing he can do anything he wishes.\\nThe ruling coalition should have strongly resisted this impudence by CJ Rana. But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",

But the coalition easily accepted his demand reflecting at once the gratitude of the coalition toward some of the past verdicts by CJ and fear that he may put the government in another crisis.\\nRana has been enjoying the fallout of the havoc he has wreaked from the sacred chair of CJ and making mockery of democracy. It is not hard to see that Rana has been influencing the court’s verdicts in a way that benefits one party or another, and reaping political benefits for that.\\nTwo major verdicts by the Supreme Court (SC) in cases related to political parties are now under suspicion. The SC verdict to revoke unification of CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Center) restoring the two parties to the state before unification in a case related to the unified party using name of another registered party was against the Constitution, laws and jurisdiction of the judiciary. That verdict was unimaginable. \\xa0\\nThe refusal by the SC to issue an interim order in the case against the ordinance making splitting of parties easier issued hastily by the Deuba government after suddenly ending the House session, and subsequent delay in issuing final verdict in the case have also raised suspicions. Every government has undermined the parliament by bringing ordinance and tampered with laws for its vested interests. There will be no meaning of democratic norms of the people’s representatives formulating laws and the rule of law if that is not controlled.\\nThe SC recently had revoked the ordinance brought by the KP Oli government to amend the act related to citizenship immediately after dissolving the House. The court had done a commendable job of curbing the autocratic tendency of the executive to rule through ordinances by avoiding the parliament. The final verdict in that case would have set a good precedent and curbed abuse of powers bolstering democracy and rule of law.\\nBut the SC has again treaded the wrong path in the case related to the ordinance about splitting of parties. The SC has blatantly ignored the precedent it established in the ordinance related to citizenship. The double standard of the Apex Court in cases related to two similar ordinances has not just hit the credibility of the judiciary but raised suspicions that CJ Rana influences court verdicts to serve his immoral interests in connivance with political parties. CJ Rana has himself proved the suspicions to be true by accepting his share in Cabinet expansion.\\nOpposing such immoral acts of CJ is not opposing the judiciary or attacking the dignity of the court. The judiciary is not an individual justice or CJ, for that matter, who does not remain within the limits and disregards the sanctity of the judiciary.\\nCondemning such justices rather saves the judiciary and all those honest justices who continuously work with constitutional integrity and cannot even think about treading the path Rana has taken. Slamming Rana will save the justices who twice revived the House dissolved unconstitutionally by Oli going against Rana’s wishes. Criticizing Rana will safeguard the public trust over those very justices who have not participated in the political dealmaking of Rana.\\nWe should not forget here that CJ Rana agreed to reinstate the House for the first time only after three justices in the five-strong constitutional bench stood for House reinstatement. Two justices refused to stay in the constitutional bench formed by CJ Rana in the case against the second dissolution by Oli. The rest of the justices then forced Rana to constitute the bench on the basis of seniority. The constitutional bench formed on the basis of seniority then reinstated the House. \\xa0\\nThe current transgression by Rana has provided an opportunity to UML leaders to claim that the verdict for House reinstatement was also given on the basis of political machination. Rana in this way has not just dragged other SC justices working with honesty and integrity into suspicion but also gravely reduced the credibility of the judiciary.\\nCJ Rana would have deserved impeachment if politicians at the top were not complicit in such grave crimes. Merely demanding share in government would be sufficient to impeach a CJ in a well-functioning democracy. But our politicians are so lowly and decadent that they are condemned to fulfilling the quota demanded by CJ in appointments in the government and constitutional bodies. Oli gave Rana share in appointments in constitutional bodies when he was PM. Deuba gave Rana a share even in the Cabinet this time.\\nOur politicians will not muster moral courage to impeach Rana due to this background. The responsibility to resist the immoral deeds of Rana is now on the judiciary itself. The SC justices, the Nepal Bar Association, and the SC Bar Association must seriously carry out consultations. Such incidents erode the legitimacy of democracy and undermine rule of law, and the courageous stand of people with integrity and honesty at such times will instill life in democracy and save democracy.\\nNepali Congress (NC) that considers itself to be the mother of parliamentary democracy in Nepal and its leaders and cadres also have a huge responsibility. Maoist Center Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who does not respect or believe in parliamentary democracy a bit, defending Hamal’ appointment is not surprising because he believes all the means toward climbing to power and staying are fair. But NC leaders and cadres should seriously contemplate whether corruption of the executive by an immoral and whimsical CJ is acceptable in parliamentary democracy or not? Whether the party president who has committed such a grave attack and crime against democracy is acceptable or not? Whether the party president can continue to lead the party and government in the coming days or not? Why should the Nepali people bear with Deuba who undermines democracy, Constitution and the party ideals every time he reaches power even if the party leaders and cadres consider him fit to be party president? Why should NC under Deuba again be sent to the government?\\nThe coming days will show how people in the judiciary retaliate against CJ’s arbitrariness or those in NC will resist Deuba. But one thing is absolutely clear. Deuba and Rana, and not Hamal, are the ones who should be punished in this episode. The attack on democracy by PM Deuba and CJ Rana, who have repeatedly failed to maintain clean image even in the past, this time has plummeted their image to the nadir of ignominy. History will not absolve them of this ignominy.\\n',\n",

       "\"\\nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) has removed Dhaka Kumar Shrestha from lawmaker and party member after the audio recording of a phone conversation alleged to be between him and businessman Durga Prasai.\\nThe party’s central committee meeting held on Wednesday has decided to punish Shrestha after audio recording of him purportedly demanding Rs 20 million from promoter of B&C Medical College Durga Prasai was made public.\\nTalking to reporters after the meeting RSP President Lamichhane said that Shrestha was removed after finding enough grounds to punish him despite him denying that the voice on the audio was not his.\\nKapurbot Media on Sunday had published audio recording of what it claims is the deal between Shrestha and Prasai.\\nShrestha, who was elected to the House of Representatives (HoR) through the Proportional Representation electoral system, can be heard telling Prasai that the amount was needed to give to RSP President Rabi Lamichhane’s men for Shrestha to become health minister.\\nThe conversation took place at the start of January, as Prasai informs in the audio, when RSP was negotiating in the then ruling coalition also including CPN-UML to get the Health Ministry. Shrestha can be heard telling Prasai that Lamichhane would make him heath minister only if he hands over Rs 20-25 million to Lamichhane's men.\\nLamichhane also revealed that Shrestha threatened the party’s discipline committee to finish RSP if he were punished. “He has been repeatedly changing his version. His guilt was proven also because the audio was recorded in January. He was allowed to present his version (in the party) repeatedly,” Lamichhane stated. “He also wished that he were not removed but also warned that he would show the party if he were punished.”\\nHe claimed that he did not know who Shrestha was referring to as his men in the ‘core team’ in the audio recording. “Why not punish if facts are uncovered about the core team? He has now come to one level of bargaining. What should be known is we will assist the CIAA,” Lamichhane stressed.\\nLamichhane added that Shrestha had the option of appealing with the party if he were not satisfied with the decision to punish him.\\nThe party had suspended Shrestha immediately after the audio recording was made public and instructed the central discipline and conduct committee to investigate facts about the telephone conversation and submit the report to the central committee within three days.\\nRSP has also decided to send acid attack victim Bindabasini Kansakar as HoR member through the PR electoral system to replace Shrestha.\\n\""

      "Enter any news Anurag Maloo, who went missing on Monday, was found in a critical condition by rescuers.  Two other Indian climbers were rescued on Tuesday, while an Irish climber died while descending Annapurna.  It is the 10th highest mountain in the world and is known for its treacherous terrain.  Mr Maloo is currently seeking treatment at Manipal Hospital in Pokhara city, a sherpa from Seven Summit Treks - a mountaineering company that led the search operation - told India's ANI news agency.  Amit Chowdhury, a board member at the UIAA - the international mountaineering and climbing federation based in Switzerland - told the BBC that it was possible for climbers to survive after falling into a crevasse.  \"A crevasse is warmer and well protected from wind. So if he was not badly injured, it's not unusual that he survived in a crevasse,\" he said.  A resident of Rajasthan state, Mr Maloo, went missing at around 6,000m (19,600ft) while descending from a camp.  \"While coming down, he slipped and fell into a crevasse between Camp III and Camp II,\" his father Om Prakash told Indian Express newspaper.  Hi brother, Aashish, had launched an online petition urging the Indian and Nepalese governments to send a special rescue team that \"is trained to operate in such risky terrain\" to find Mr Maloo.  \"A team of sherpas have started the search operation but that's not enough at the moment,\" the petition said.  Last year, Mr Maloo successfully climbed a mountain in the eastern Himalayan range in Nepal. He was on a mission to climb all 14 peaks above 8,000m and scale the world's seven summits - the highest mountains in each continent - to create awareness about the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  On Tuesday, authorities rescued climber Baljeet Kaur and four other climbers from the high camps of the mountain.  In November, Ms Kaur became the first Indian woman to summit Mount Manaslu in Nepal without using oxygen.\n",
